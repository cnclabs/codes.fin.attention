the company also encourages its store managers to create in store advertising displays and signage in order to increase customer traffic and impulse purchases 
store operations all fred s stores are open six days a week monday through saturday  and most stores are open seven days a week excluding the pharmacy 
store hours are generally from am to am  however  certain stores are only open until pm each fred s store is managed by a full time store manager and those stores with a pharmacy employ a full time pharmacist 
the company s district managers and five regional vice presidents supervise the management and operation of fred s stores 
fred s operates pharmacies as of january   which offer brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and are staffed by licensed pharmacists and are managed by healthcare managers 
the addition of acquired pharmacies in the company s stores has resulted in increased store sales and sales per selling square foot 
management believes that the pharmacy department  in addition to the other merchandise departments  increases customer traffic and repeat visits and is an integral part of the store s operation 
the company has an incentive compensation plan for store managers  pharmacists and district managers based on meeting or exceeding targeted profit percentage contributions 
various factors included in determining profit percentage contribution are gross profits and controllable expenses at the store level 
these factors of operating performance are reviewed regularly by executive management to pinpoint developments in key performance areas 
management believes that this incentive compensation plan  together with the company s store management training program  are instrumental in maximizing store performance 
the company s training program covers all aspects of the company s operation from product knowledge to handling customers with courtesy 
inventory control the company s centralized management information system maintains a daily stock keeping unit sku level inventory and current and historical sales information for each store and the distribution centers 
this system is supported by our in store point of sale pos system  which captures sku and other data at the time of sale 
the merchandising arm of the system uses the data received from the stores to provide integrated inventory management  automated replenishment  promotional planning  space management  and merchandise planning

this system is integrated with the company s centralized management information system to provide up to date perpetual records as well as facilitating merchandise allocation and distribution decisions 
the company uses cycle counts throughout the year to ensure accuracy within the warehouse management system 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in that the company s sales volume is heavier around the first of the calendar month 
many of the customers who shop at fred s stores rely on government aid  social security  and other means that are typically paid at the first of the month 
these governmental payment cycles  coupled with the distribution of our newspaper advertising circular are major factors in concentrating sales earlier in the calendar month 
the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales  gross profit  operating income  and net income by quarter

competition the discount retail merchandise business is highly competitive 
we compete in respect to price  store location  in stock consistency  merchandise quality  assortment and presentation  and customer service with many national  regional and local retailing establishments  including department stores  discount stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores 
our competitors range from smaller  growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we do 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with them in the future 
see statement regarding forward looking disclosures and item a risk factors

licensure and regulation of retail pharmacies there are extensive federal and state regulations applicable to the practice of pharmacy at the retail level 
we are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations concerning the protection of confidential patient medical records and information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
most states have laws and regulations governing the operation and licensing of pharmacies  and regulate standards of professional practice by pharmacy providers 
these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
additionally  the drug enforcement agency dea requires that controlled substances be monitored and controlled at all times 
as a provider of medicare prescription drug plan benefits  we are subject to various federal regulations promulgated by the center for medicare and medicaid services under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in the future we may also be subject to changes to various state and federal insurance laws and regulations in connection with the company s pharmacy operations 
healthcare initiatives legislative and regulatory initiatives pertaining to such healthcare related issues as reimbursement policies  payment practices  therapeutic substitution programs  and other healthcare cost containment issues are frequently introduced at both the state and federal level 
the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act of may affect our pharmacy business  but it is too early to judge what that impact might be

risk factors investors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to fred s securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management  or that management currently deems immaterial  may also impair the company s business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that instance  the trading price of fred s securities could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
our business is somewhat seasonal 
we typically realize a significant portion of our net sales during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if required  increase in anticipation of this holiday season 
a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns  especially in seasonal merchandise 
we operate in a competitive industry 
we are in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail industry 
this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices  and lower margins  required to maintain our competitive position 
we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers  including department stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores  some of whom may have greater resources than we do 
this competitive environment subjects us to various risks  including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth 
some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities  advertising programs  and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts 
changes in third party reimbursements  including government programs  could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
for the years ended january  and january   pharmaceutical sales were and of total sales  respectively 
the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions 
payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost 
private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates 
accordingly  reimbursements may be limited or reduced  thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows 
additionally  and in light of a worsening economy and recent healthcare legislation  government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 
changes in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix 
a general slowdown in the united states economy  rising personal debt levels  rising foreclosure rates  rising fuel prices  or changes in government aid  social security  and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales  product mix and margins 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  inflation  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
we might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies  which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance 
in addition  increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole 
natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business 
unusually adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or similar disruptions  could significantly reduce our net sales 
in addition  these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers 
a number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes 
a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business 
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory  process customer transactions and record results 
our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  security breaches and natural disasters 
if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly  we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them  and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customer  we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 
the nature of our business involves the receipt of personal information about our customers 
if we experience a data security breach  we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 
in addition  our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to discontinue usage of credit cards in our stores  decline to use our pharmacy services  or stop shopping at our stores altogether 
such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business 
we have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers  principally in china 
as a result  political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs 
also  our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced 
accordingly  changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and  if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers  decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings 
we purchase a significant amount of goods from procter and gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our operations and results 
delays and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business 
we maintain two distribution facilities in our geographic territory  and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth 
one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
we plan on expanding and refreshing our network of stores through new store openings and remodeling existing stores each year 
delays in opening  refreshing or remodeling stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth  which may in turn reduce revenue and margin growth 
adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores  such as changes in labor  utilities  fuel and transportation  and other operating costs  could have an adverse impact on us 
operational difficulties could disrupt our business 
our stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel 
our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage  may negatively impact our sales and or margin 
in addition  we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost effective manner  any disruption  unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact store operations 
our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed 
we rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information 
the disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our operations 
use of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business 
we have a long term supply contract from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  for our pharmaceutical operations 
any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier  deterioration in their financial condition  changes in terms  or an industry wide change in wholesale business practices  including those of our supplier  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
higher than expected costs and not achieving our targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs  systems and technology could adversely affect our business 
we are undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as store upgrades and infrastructure initiatives 
the failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
changes in state or federal legislation or regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs  trade restrictions  tariffs  quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets 
changes in trade restrictions  new tariffs and quotas  and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results 
we depend on the success of our new store opening program for a portion of our growth 
our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores 
unavailability of store locations that we deem attractive  delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores  difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth  the costs associated with new stores and or the profitability of new stores 
our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions 
changes in our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level  in distribution facilities  and at the corporate level  including our senior management team 
adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees 
adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business 
we are a party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims  including those described elsewhere in this annual report 
operating results could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against us are made  requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
despite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell  we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products  including food products that are recalled  defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful 
such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties  product contamination or spoilage  including the presence of foreign objects  substances  chemicals  other agents  or residues introduced during the growing  storage  handling and transportation phases 
all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws 
we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers 
however  if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws  which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products 
even with adequate insurance and indemnification  such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products 
our litigation expenses could increase as well  which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 
our ability to achieve the results of store closures under our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business 
as part of our continuing operations  we perform research and analysis to discover potential underperforming stores 
we use such research and analysis to identify potential store closures 
the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors  including the timing of execution  the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties  or unexpected costs  any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan 
increases in our insurance related costs could significantly affect our business 
the costs of many types of insurance and self insurance  especially workers compensation  employee health care and others  have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings  and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
we also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers  including some who operate in foreign countries  which could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage 
while we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices  no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise 
should a product liability issue arise  the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our insurance related costs increase significantly  or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
adverse impacts associated with the current economic and financial crisis could affect our business 
the lingering economic downturn could have an adverse impact of our business and profitability 
many consumers have fallen prey to the current crisis either as a result of job losses  foreclosures  or their inability to obtain short term financing  all of which could negatively affect their ability to shop in our stores and buy our products 
additionally  decreased consumer demand resulting from a pronounced negative consumer sentiment and an increasing personal savings rate could also negatively affect our sales and profits 
also  our ability to obtain financing  should the need arise outside of our current contractual credit facility  could be at risk due to restrictive lending practices in the wake of the liquidity crisis in the united states financial system 
item b unresolved staff comments none 
item properties as of january   the geographical distribution of the company s retail store locations in states was as follows state number of stores georgia mississippi alabama tennessee arkansas south carolina louisiana north carolina texas florida kentucky illinois missouri indiana oklahoma the company owns the real estate and the buildings for locations  of which are closed  are subleased and are subject to ground leases 
six of these locations are encumbered by mortgages see note indebtedness 
the company leases the remaining locations from third parties pursuant to leases that provide for monthly rental payments primarily at fixed rates although a number of leases provide for additional rent based on sales 
store locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
three hundred and sixty four of the locations are in strip centers or adjacent to a downtown shopping district  with the remainder being freestanding 
it is anticipated that existing buildings and buildings to be developed by others will be available for lease to satisfy the company s expansion program in the near term 
it is management s intention to enter into leases of relatively moderate length with renewal options  rather than entering into long term leases 
the company will thus have maximum relocation flexibility in the future  since continued availability of existing buildings is anticipated in the company s market areas 
the company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters situated on approximately acres in memphis  tennessee 
the site contains approximately  square feet of distribution center space  and  square feet of office and retail space 
presently  the company utilizes  square feet of office space and  square feet of retail space at the site 
the retail space is operated as a fred s store and is used to test new products  merchandising ideas and technology 
the company financed the construction of its  square foot distribution center in dublin  georgia with taxable industrial development revenue bonds issued by the city of dublin and county of laurens development authority 
presently  both distribution centers are able to serve a total of approximately to stores 
item legal proceedings in december  a lawsuit entitled whiteaker  et al v 
fred s stores of tennessee  inc  et al  was filed in the united states district court in the northern district of mississippi  in which the plaintiffs allege past and future damages as a result of a trip and fall accident at a fred s store 
the company denied liability and vigorously defended the case on its merits 
in accordance with fasb asc  contingencies  the company did not feel that a loss in this matter was probable or could be reasonably estimated 
however  on november   a jury rendered a million verdict and apportioned the company with fault 
this case is covered by the company s general liability insurance  which has a  deductible 
the company is discussing all of its options  including  post trial options and appeals 
on or about february   the trial judge set aside a verdict amount as being excessive but left in effect the percentage of fault and ordered a new trial on damages only 
in july  a lawsuit styled jessica chapman  on behalf of herself and others similarly situated  v 
fred s stores of tennessee  inc was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama  southern division  in which the plaintiff alleges that she and other female assistant store managers are paid less than comparable males and seeks compensable damages  liquidated damages  attorney fees and court costs 
the plaintiff filed a motion seeking collective action 
briefs have been filed  but the court has not ruled 
the company believes that all assistant managers have been properly paid and that the matter is not appropriate for collective action treatment 
discovery has not yet begun 
the company is and will continue to vigorously defend this matter 
in accordance with fasb asc  contingencies  the company does not feel that a loss in this matter is probable or can be reasonably estimated 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability for this case 
in august  a lawsuit entitled julia atchinson  et al 
v 
fred s stores of tennessee  inc  et al  was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama  southern division in which the plaintiff alleged that she and other current and former fred s discount assistant store managers were improperly classified as exempt executive employees under the fair labor standards act flsa and sought to recover overtime pay  liquidated damages  attorney s fees and court costs 
although the company continues to believe that its assistant store managers are and have been properly classified as exempt employees under flsa and that the matter was not appropriate for collective action treatment  the parties agreed to mediate this case in january and did so successfully  reaching a settlement of million including attorneys fees and costs 
the court approved the settlement and the company subsequently paid it in august based on the substantial costs of continuing litigation  unfavorably high jury verdicts against other retailers and the constant distraction to management of a possible protracted jury trial  we believe that this is a favorable settlement for fred s 
fred s has admitted no liability or wrongdoing  and no liability or wrongdoing has been found against the company 
in addition to the matters disclosed above  the company is party to several pending legal proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business 
although the outcome of the proceedings and claims cannot be determined with certainty  management of the company is of the opinion that it is unlikely that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial statements as a whole 
however  litigation involves an element of uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that pending lawsuits will not consume the time and energy of our management or that future developments will not cause these actions or claims  individually or in aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on the financial statements as a whole 
we intend to vigorously defend or prosecute each pending lawsuit

executive summary we operate a chain of more than discount general merchandise stores in fifteen states primarily in the southeastern united states 
our stores generally serve low  middle and fixed income families located in small to medium sized towns 
full service pharmacies are included in of the company s stores 
the company also markets goods and services to franchised fred s stores 
our company was founded in and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
at the beginning of fiscal  we introduced and began the roll out of our core program  which is a key strategic initiative designed to highlight key categories within our stores that differentiate us from our competition 
the core categories home  celebration  pet  pharmacy and paper and chemical are strong trip driving departments in which fred s has a clear and marketable advantage versus small box competitors 
additionally  these categories have high household penetration and resonate with customers across multiple demographics 
this initiative is also intended to shift our product mix toward the more discretionary  higher margin categories and away from the lower margin consumable categories  thus driving higher margin and leading to increased operating profit 
early results of our core program are encouraging and we are pleased with the performance in we expect to build on this success in another significant initiative accomplished in was to remodel and refurbish more than stores during the year  implementing our new layout that our team developed 
the implementation of the core program requires a moderate refresh of the store to address space allocation  product placement and adjacencies and signage in the core categories 
the implementation is also accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign  including print advertising and direct mail  timed to coincide with the refresh of the store and then continuing for six months thereafter 
we will continue the reinvestment in stores in  targeting additional remodels and upgrades to be completed 
when these are completed  we will have approximately of our stores with the upgraded fred s store look and feel 
another key element of our strategy in was the introduction of new major national brand product lines such as coca cola  purina  and energizer 
our customer response has been favorable 
sales and customer traffic have exceeded expectations 
we will continue to review additional opportunities to add strong national brands to our merchandise mix 
in step with the brand name product expansion  our own brand initiative continues to be a key strategy for the company in terms of building customer loyalty and increasing gross margin 
we have reached an own brand penetration rate of approximately of total sales  and that number will continue to grow in the future as new own brand products are introduced 
our commitment to quality in our own brand products is resonating with our customers and they continue to make the switch to our fred s brand 
we are continuing to add new products to our own brand line on an ongoing basis  with new items in health and beauty care  food  paper and chemicals  and party goods introduced during recognizing our pharmacy department as a key factor differentiating us from other small box discount retailers  we have accelerated our growth strategy in this area and are aggressively pursuing opportunities to acquire independent pharmacies within our targeted markets 
our emphasis will continue to be on acquisitions and buying prescription files  but cold start openings will be employed where it makes sense to do so 
we offer fred s prescription plus program which includes generic pricing on over different drugs in all pharmacies in the chain 
we consider this program to be a strong traffic driver and includes over  members in the program 
gross margin improvement continues to be a major focus of the company  as highlighted above with our core and own brand strategies 
we are aggressively pursuing product sourcing improvements and cost reductions across all product lines in order to reduce overall product costs and  in turn  raise our gross margin 
additionally  we have implemented new processes intended to control both promotional and clearance markdowns 
we also continue to make improvements in our loss prevention processes and procedures  and those improvements are leading to reduced shrinkage in our stores and  consequently  higher gross margin 
these efforts resulted in a basis point improvement in gross margin in when compared to the previous year 
expense containment continues to be a focus of the company  especially in light of current economic conditions 
we are aggressively pursuing cost reductions in all functional areas and are also continuously reviewing internal processes to find efficiencies and or redundancies and drive unnecessary costs and expenses out of the business 
these efforts are being coordinated at the executive level and close attention is being paid not to sacrifice service to our customers 
throughout  we have continued with capital improvements in infrastructure  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities 
technology upgrades have been made in the areas of merchandising allocations systems  human resources and payroll systems  in store systems  and pharmacy systems 
looking to  we recognize the need to further refine fred s differentiated strategy as we continue to adapt to an evolving retail environment 
our core program will be an ongoing catalyst for comparable store sales growth and gross margin improvement 
we will continue to reinvest in our stores targeting additional remodels and upgraded stores in when these are completed  we will have refreshed approximately of our chain with the work completed over the and years 
we will continue our initiatives of improving the fundamentals of the business  improving the merchandising and marketing programs  expanding national and own brand products  raising talent levels throughout the company  and better customer service 
we will accelerate new store growth from stores in to to stores in our store growth will be focused in those areas where market share and brand awareness are strong  providing a greater potential for success 
we will open approximately to pharmacies in we continue to view our pharmacy department growth as a solid use of invested capital 
despite regulatory changes to impact reimbursement rates on pharmaceuticals that may impact sales and margin in  our optimism remains strong about the future of pharmacy growth due to the customer loyalty it brings to our stores 
on average  stores with a pharmacy department have higher general merchandise sales  consistently running at or better than stores without pharmacies 
with the aging population growth  new generic drugs being introduced  healthcare reform legislation  and expanding clinical services by pharmacists  we expect pharmacy scripts to continue increasing at an accelerated pace in and beyond 
building on the improvements made this past year  we expect to continue driving higher sales  operating margin  and earnings 
for the full year  we expect total sales to increase to  driven by the acceleration in new stores and a comparable store increase of to 
we anticipate the general merchandise comparable store sales increases to outpace the pharmacy department sales in due to the continued shift from brand to generic scripts 
this shift has an adverse effect on sales as branded drugs carry a significantly higher selling price than generic drugs 
we are planning pharmacy department comparable store sales to be relatively flat in earnings per diluted share for are projected to be in the range of to  an increase of to over actual results 
our earnings expectation considers the impact of anticipated reductions in state medicaid reimbursements on pharmacy department sales and margins totaling million to million or to per diluted share 
capital expenditures for are expected to be in the range of million to million 
additionally  million to million is planned related to acquisitions of pharmacies during a breakdown of capital expenditures is as follows continuation of the core program rollout  million to million new stores and pharmacies  million to million  existing store maintenance  million distribution  million technology and corporate upgrades  million critical factors to the company s future success include the successful execution of our core program  as well as managing the strategy for opening new stores and pharmacies  maintaining high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  controlling the effects of inflation or deflation  controlling product mix  increasing operating margin through improved gross margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s future needs 
other factors that will affect company performance in include the continuing impacts of the changing regulatory environment in which our pharmacy department operates 
additionally  we believe that high unemployment  rising fuel prices  and other inflationary impacts continues to place tremendous economic pressure on the consumer 
however  we also continue to believe that our affordable pricing and value proposition make us an attractive destination for our customer base and positions us well to continue growing market share 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company markets goods and services through company owned stores and franchised stores as of january  net sales include sales of merchandise from company owned stores  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
sales to franchised stores are recorded when the merchandise is shipped from the company s warehouse 
revenues resulting from layaway sales are recorded upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
the company also sells gift cards for which the revenue is recognized at time of redemption 
the company records a gift card liability on the date the gift card is issued to the customer 
revenue is recognized and the gift card liability is reduced as the customer redeems the gift card 
the company will recognize aged liabilities as revenue when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote gift card breakage 
the company has not recognized any revenue from gift card breakage since the inception of the program in and does not expect to record any gift card breakage revenue until there is more certainty regarding our ability to retain such amounts in light of current consumer protection and state escheatment laws 
in addition  the company charges the franchised stores a fee based on a percentage of their purchases from the company 
these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred s name and other administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores and are therefore netted against selling  general and administrative expenses 
total franchise income for  and was   and  respectively 
inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out fifo method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  after applying the cost to retail ratio  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value market value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink  there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses shrink is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  thus the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk of this estimate has in the determination of the cost value of inventory 
the company calculates inventory losses shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the company has experienced improvement in reducing shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year due to improved inventory control measures  which includes the chain wide utilization of the nex dex technology 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which were approximately million  and million at january  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at january  and million at january  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company has historically included an estimate of inbound freight and certain general and administrative costs in merchandise inventory as prescribed by gaap 
these costs include activities surrounding the procurement and storage of merchandise inventory such as merchandise planning and buying  warehousing  accounting  information technology and human resources  as well as inbound freight 
the total amount of procurement and storage costs and inbound freight included in merchandise inventory at january  is million compared to million at january  impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores open at least years or remodeled more than years 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease or years for owned stores 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability  which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets or other reasonable estimates of fair market value based upon management s judgment 
exit and disposal activities 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores and underperforming pharmacies 
the closures took place during the first three quarters of pursuant to our restructuring plan announced february  and were the result of an in depth study conducted by the company of its operations over the previous quarters 
the study revealed that fred s has a strong and healthy store base  and that by closing these underperforming stores the company would improve its cash flow and operating margin  both of which are core goals of the company s overall strategic plan 
as a result of the successful execution of this plan  the company is stronger and is in a better position to respond to fluctuations in the economy and to take advantage of opportunities to further improve our business 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores  which is consistent with our anticipated amount of annual store closures in the normal course of business 
therefore  store closures of this nature in this and future years are not deemed exit and disposal related activities 
inventory impairment during fiscal  we recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market in stores that were planned for closure as part of the company s strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
the adjustment was recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended february  in fiscal  we recorded an additional below cost inventory adjustment of million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market associated with stores closed in the third quarter and utilized the entire million impairment 
lease termination for store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the cease use date when the store is closed in accordance with fasb asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
liabilities are established at the cease use date for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by fasb asc key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements  estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations  and estimation of other related exit costs 
if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates  the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts 
these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
during fiscal  we closed underperforming stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million in rent expense in conjunction with those closings  of which million was utilized during fiscal  leaving 
million in the reserve at the beginning of fiscal year during fiscal  we closed underperforming stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million  of which million was charged to rent expense and 
million reduced the liability for deferred rent 
we utilized million during the period  leaving million in the reserve at january  during fiscal  we reserved an additional million in rent expense related to the store closings 
we utilized million during the period  leaving million in the reserve at january  during fiscal  we reserved an additional million in rent expense related to the revision of the estimated amount of the remaining lease liability for the fiscal and store closures 
we also utilized million  leaving 
million in the reserve at january  the following table illustrates the exit and disposal activity related to the store closures discussed in the previous paragraphs in millions beginning balance january  additions fy utilized fy ending balance january  lease contract termination liability fixed asset impairment during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million in selling  general and administrative expense for the impairment of fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with the planned closure of stores in during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an additional charge of 
million associated with store closures that occurred in the third quarter 
impairment of million for the planned store closures was recorded in property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital lease are depreciated in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
vendor rebates and allowances and advertising costs 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with fasb asc customer payments and incentives  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of january   the company had approximately vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within a month to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years 
in accordance with fasb asc advertising costs  the company charges advertising  including production costs  to selling  general and administrative expense on the first day of the advertising period 
gross advertising expenses for  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
gross advertising expenses were reduced by vendor cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
it would be the company s intention to incur a similar amount of advertising expense as in prior years and in support of our stores even if we did not receive support from our vendors in the form of cooperative adverting programs 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company carries additional coverage for excessive or catastrophic claims with stop loss limits of  for property and general liability and  for employee medical 
the company s insurance reserve was million and million on january  and january   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with reserve utilization of million 
income taxes 
the company reports income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
under fasb asc  the asset and liability method is used for computing future income tax consequences of events  which have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities see note income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fasb asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
that is codified in fasb asc we adopted fasb asc as of february   the first day of fiscal this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb asc and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under fasb asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition see note income taxes 
fasb asc further requires that interest and penalties required to be paid on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements 
the company includes potential interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fasb asc in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense 
as of january   accrued interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively  and are both recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non current liabilities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized post adoption includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the fasb asc  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc results for prior periods have not been restated 
effective january   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fasb asc for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of fasb asc fasb asc also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
the impact of adopting fasb asc on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
stock based compensation expense  post adoption of fasb asc  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity incentive plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding equity incentive plans 
results of operations the following table provides a comparison of fred s financial results for the past three years 
in this table  categories of income and expense are expressed as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of good sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before taxes income taxes net income cost of goods sold includes the cost of product sold  along with all costs associated with inbound freight 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with purchasing  receiving  handling  securing and storing product 
these costs are associated with products that have been sold and no longer remain in ending inventory 
results include certain charges for the non routine closing of stores in see item  exit and disposal activities section 
comparable store sales 
our calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for stores that have been opened after the end of the th month following the store s grand opening month  and includes stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 
additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments within a fred s store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth 
therefore  the introduction of all new departments is included in same store sales in the year in which the department is introduced 
likewise  our same store sales calculation is not adjusted for the removal of a department from a location 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales for increased to  million from  million in  a year over year increase of million or 
on a comparable store basis  sales for increased million compared with a million increase in the same period last year
