item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our indebtedness  including the financial covenants under our credit facilities  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders for our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to us  and they and the lender of our second lien term loan could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities  which is substantially all of our assets 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
our revolving credit facility also limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  as determined by the lenders in accordance with the credit agreement 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base will be required to be repaid immediately  or we will be required to pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration and development activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive quantities of oil or natural gas will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including reductions in oil and natural gas prices  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  possible federal  state  regional and municipal regulatory moratoriums on new permits  delays in securing new permits  changes to existing permitting requirements without grandfathering of existing permits and possible prohibition and limitations with regard to certain completion activities  limitations in takeaway capacity or the market for oil and natural gas  increase in severance taxes  and lost or damaged oilfield development and services tools 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend  in part  on data obtained through geological and geophysical analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying potentially productive hydrocarbon traps and geohazards 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents numerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities  and present value calculations may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our reserves as of december  were based on the twelve month first day of the month historical average west texas intermediate oil prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials of per bbl and the twelve month first day of the month historical average henry hub gas prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials of per mmbtu 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
in addition  discounted future net cash flows are estimated assuming royalties to the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement  or boe  formerly known as the minerals management service of the us department of the interior  royalty owners and other state and federal regulatory agencies with respect to our affected properties  and will be paid or suspended during the life of the properties based upon oil and natural gas prices as of the date of the estimate 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the standardized measure of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the sec s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at the standardized measure of future net cash flows 
we are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation  which has previously resulted in a write down of our estimated net reserves  and may result in additional write downs in the future if commodity prices decline 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation  on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgment 
the current ceiling calculation utilizes a twelve month first day of the month historical average price and does not allow for us to re evaluate the calculation subsequent to the end of the period if prices increase 
it also dictates that costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  a write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period 
we recognized a non cash  pre tax ceiling test impairment of million and million in the third and fourth quarters  respectively  of and of million in the first quarter of we did not record any write down or impairment for the year ended december  due to the volatility of commodity prices  however  should natural gas prices decline in the future  it is possible that write downs could occur 
in addition  write downs of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
for example  we recognized a downward revision to our proved reserves in the third and fourth quarters of it is possible that we may recognize additional revisions to our proved reserves in the future

table of contents government laws and regulations can change 
our activities are subject to federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations 
extensive laws  regulations and rules regulate activities and operations in the oil and gas industry 
some of the laws  regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations  production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other aspects of our business  including our general profitability 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations 
for example  in response to the april fire and explosion onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig deepwater horizon  leading to the oil spill in the gulf of mexico  the boe has limited certain drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico 
the boe may also issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the us gulf of mexico  and potentially in other geographic regions  and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production 
this incident could also result in drilling suspensions or other regulatory initiatives in other areas of the us and abroad 
furthermore  the us environmental protection agency has recently focused on public concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities 
this renewed focus could lead to additional federal and state regulations affecting the oil and gas industry 
additional regulations or other changes to existing laws and regulations could significantly impact our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our business requires a staff with technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with technical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing and transportation or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
under interruptible or short term transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system or for other reasons specified by the particular agreements 
we may be required to shut in natural gas wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity 
our concentration of operations in certain geographic areas  such as the eagle ford shale  increases this risk and the potential impact upon us 
when that also occurs  we are unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production can be tied to a pipeline or gathering system 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our competitors include major and large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties at a lower cost and more quickly than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
our strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player has resulted in operations concentrated in one geographic area and increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein 
currently our operations are highly concentrated in south texas  primarily in the eagle ford shale 
this concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform 
for example  we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting texas  natural disasters in the geographic area  competition for equipment  services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 

table of contents our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
if oil and natural gas prices increase in the future  increasing levels of exploration and production could result in response to these stronger prices  and as a result  the demand for oilfield services could rise  and the costs of these services could increase  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in the eagle ford shale of texas  california or the rockies  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  or well fluids  fires  hurricanes  tropical storms  earthquakes particularly in california  mud slides  and flooding  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties 
we are not fully insured against all risks  including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution  but not for other types of pollution 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
competition and regulation of hydraulic fracturing services could impede our ability to develop our shale plays 
the unavailability or high cost of high pressure pumping services or hydraulic fracturing services  chemicals  proppant  water  and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale gas and shale oil resource plays which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development 
hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews 
a shortage of service crews or proppant  chemical  or water  especially if this shortage occurred in south texas or the rockies  could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget 
there is significant regulatory uncertainty as some states have begun to regulate hydraulic fracturing and the united states environmental protection agency and united states congress are investigating the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources  which could affect the current regulatory jurisdiction of the states and increase the cycle times and costs to receive permits  delay or possibly preclude receipt of permits in certain areas  impact water usage and waste water disposal and require chemical additives disclosures 
environmental matters and costs can be significant 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean up  remediation  restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
the cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors  including future changes to laws and regulations 
we have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future growth 

table of contents possible regulations related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to the warming of the earth atmosphere 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of the burning of refined oil products and natural gas  are examples of greenhouse gases 
the us congress is considering climate related legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  at least states have developed measures to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
the epa has adopted regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities and is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the existing federal clean air act 
in november  the epa adopted rules expanding the industries subject to greenhouse gas reporting to include certain petroleum and natural gas facilities 
these rules require data collection beginning in and reporting beginning in some of our facilities are subject to these rules 
passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various states  or the adoption of other regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies  that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane or carbon dioxide in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas 
our property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make property acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  ability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities  potential lack of operating experience in the geographic market where the acquired properties are located  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements  the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  revenues  capital expenditures  and operating costs  including synergies  a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses  or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  and the incurrence of other significant charges  such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties  asset devaluation  or restructuring charges 
our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses  and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
also  our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 

table of contents hedging transactions may limit our potential revenue  result in financial losses or reduce our income 
we have entered into oil  natural gas  and ngl price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production through these hedging transactions may limit our potential revenue if oil  natural gas  and ngl prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
as of december   approximately of total hedged natural gas transactions represented hedged prices of commodities at the pg e citygate and houston ship channel  of hedged crude oil transactions represented hedged prices of crude oil at the west texas intermediate on the nymex and approximately of the total hedged ngl transactions represented hedged ngl prices at mont belvieu propane non tet opis 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
our current hedge positions are with counterparties that are lenders in our credit facilities 
our lenders are comprised of banks and financial institutions that could default or fail to perform under our contractual agreements 
a default under any of these agreements could negatively impact our financial performance 
the impairment of financial institutions or counterparty credit default could adversely affect us 
our commodity derivative transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparties that include commercial banks  investment banks  insurance companies  other investment funds and other institutions 
further deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us 
we may have significant exposure to our derivative counterparties and the value of our derivative positions may provide a significant amount of cash flow 
in addition  if any lender under our revolving credit facility is unable to fund its commitment  our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our revolving credit facility 
currently  no single lender in our credit facility has commitments representing more than of our total commitments 
however  if banks continue to consolidate  we may experience a more concentrated credit risk 
federal legislation regarding derivatives could have an adverse effect on our ability and cost of entering into derivative transactions 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank reform act  which  among other provisions  establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the new legislation requires the commodities futures trading commission the cftc and the securities and exchange commission to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
on october   the cftc introduced its first series of proposed rules coming out of the dodd frank reform act 
the effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is currently uncertain 
of particular concern  the dodd frank reform act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities 
while several senators have indicated that it was not the intent of the act to require margin from end users  the exemption is not in the act 
the new requirements to be enacted  to the extent applicable to us or our derivatives counterparties  may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge and otherwise manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in natural gas  oil and ngl commodity prices 
any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
among the changes contained in the president s fiscal year budget proposal  released by the white house on february   is the elimination or deferral of certain key us federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies 
such changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain us production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
recently  members of the us congress have considered similar changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect oil and gas exploration and production companies  which  if enacted  would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in us federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions within the industry that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  rosetta began to realize benefits from its transformation to an unconventional resource player 
most notably  we built a portfolio of high quality shale assets with project inventory offering visible and sustainable growth 
our success was the result of the initiative that we began three years ago to employ personnel with the appropriate competencies to execute an unconventional resource driven business model 
we were an early entrant into the eagle ford shale  one of the most competitive shale plays in the industry and one of the first participants to develop a significant leasehold position and conduct comprehensive exploratory evaluations in that play 
our efforts were coupled with a conservative fiscal approach and a focus on cost control and efficiency 
we believe that our performance as an unconventional resource player as compared to our performance serves as tangible evidence that we are now a stronger exploration and production company positioned to further increase inventory to drive significant growth 
the following are some of our major achievements in rosetta established a major new base of production and reserves in the eagle ford shale in south texas 
during  we successfully delineated a  acre position within gates ranch  successfully drilling wells and completing wells 
we believe that we have identified a significant inventory of investment opportunities 
this portfolio should lower our overall cost structure and deliver positive returns 
during  we overcame numerous operating obstacles resulting from increasing demands for service equipment and infrastructure and entered into firm long term natural gas agreements for transportation and processing capacity that will meet our current and projected production from the area for up to ten years 
in the third quarter of  we announced the light ranch field discovery in another section of our eagle ford shale holdings  which further expands our drilling inventory 

table of contents we shifted our production portfolio to a more balanced mix of natural gas liquids  crude oil and natural gas 
this reduces our exposure to current low natural gas prices and allows us to take advantage of cyclical swings in energy commodity pricing 
for the month ended december   more than of our production was from oil and ngls and that amount will increase as rosetta brings on line more production from the eagle ford shale 
approximately of reserves that we have discovered in the gates ranch are liquids 
our annual production rate averaged mmcfe d and we exited the year with a production rate of mmcfe d 
of this exit rate  was from the eagle ford shale and exemplifies the shift in our production base to unconventional resources during the year 
in addition  we drilled successful exploratory wells in the eagle ford shale in that contributed to reserve growth of 
we continue to divest our legacy assets that we believe do not offer the same investment opportunities or rate of returns as our unconventional resources 
during  we sold assets located in arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  texas  louisiana  new mexico and wyoming for approximately million with the monies redeployed into developing our positions 
we believe the divestiture of these assets will decrease our cost structure through lower general and administrative expenses and lower operating costs 
in  we expect to complete the sales of our properties in the dj basin in colorado and our holdings in the sacramento basin in california 
we retained our focus on financial flexibility as we continuously monitored our capital program results and diverted spending away from legacy natural gas producing areas to more promising opportunities offered by our high return  high value resource assets 
we refinanced our existing portfolio of debt through our senior notes offering and repayments under our revolving credit facility and term loan 
we hedged selectively during the year to ensure stable future cash flows and balanced our capital spending program with asset sales and cash on hand 
we continued our exploratory evaluations of our large acreage position in the southern alberta basin in northwest montana 
in  we drilled four delineation wells in the area 
our assessment to date confirms oil hydrocarbons in place 
we are encouraged by what we are learning and intend to fully test our position 
our business goals for are based on an announced capital program of million  subject to program results and timing 
we enter with a project inventory base that is more than double the size of the previous year with a lower overall total cost structure than our previous holdings 
as we move forward with the development of our inventory  we expect to deliver long term positive returns 
more than of our planned spending will be allocated to the development of our eagle ford shale assets  primarily in the gates ranch area 
approximately completions are planned with a fracture stimulation agreement in place to handle the increased activity 
we have contracts in place for firm transportation and processing up to mmcf d of gross wellhead production with mmcf d of capacity available no later than the fourth quarter of and total contractual capacity reached by our capital program reflects the impact of planned asset sales in the dj basin in colorado and the sacramento basin in california 
it also includes funds for the continued exploration of the southern alberta basin where we plan to drill another five vertical wells by early we remain encouraged by the results of our drilling program and expect to add horizontal wells during at this time  we believe that we have sufficient internal investment opportunities to grow the company without acquiring additional properties 
however  we continue to evaluate opportunities that fit our business model and our strategic and economic objectives 
while was a successful year for rosetta  we recognize that there are risks inherent to our industry and operating environment that could impact our ability to meet future goals 
our business model takes into account these threats and we continually work to overcome potential risks to our ability to achieve our stated growth objectives and build our asset base 
we have reduced our exposure to weak natural gas commodity prices by diversifying our production base to a higher percentage of natural gas liquids and crude oil  which continue to trade at more profitable levels 
heightened industry activity from other participants in the eagle ford shale  our largest producing area  led to some curtailments of production in we have taken aggressive steps to ensure access to transportation and processing facilities and oil field services in the area 
however  we cannot completely control all external factors that could impact our operating environment 
given the early stage of the southern alberta basin play  there are still significant risks associated with an exploration program of this magnitude 
identifying and responding effectively to potential threats in the marketplace is an important part of managing our business 
as part of our strategy to streamline our business  we announced the closing of our denver office and the reorganization of houston personnel 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of costs related to this reorganization and expect the reorganization to be completed by december  while all future costs associated with the reorganization cannot be fully anticipated  we estimate that we will incur total costs of approximately million 
we believe the consolidation of our technical resources to houston will enable us to capitalize on the dynamics and efficiencies of operating in a central location 
our capital budget of million takes into account the number of high return opportunities afforded by our position in the eagle ford shale 
it is our intention to maintain our current debt levels and to continue to redeploy proceeds from planned asset sales to the development of our eagle ford shale properties 
we are confident that we can execute our capital program based on asset sale proceeds and internally generated cash flows plus cash on hand 
we monitor our liquidity situation continuously and respond prudently to changing market conditions  commodity prices or service costs 
in the event we encounter a situation in which there is not sufficient internal funds to meet projected funding of our organic opportunities or pursue attractive acquisitions  we would consider curtailing our capital spending  drawing on the unused capacity under our existing revolving credit facility or accessing capital markets 

table of contents our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was confirmed by our lenders in october at million 
according to our agreement  the borrowing base was adjusted in december to million after the successful divestitures of our pinedale and san juan assets 
as of december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
there has not been any indication that draws under our credit facility will be restricted below current availability 
the next redetermination is scheduled to begin in april our ability to raise additional capital depends on the state of the financial markets that are subject to change depending upon economic and industry conditions 
therefore  the availability and price of capital in the financial markets could negatively affect our liquidity position and cost of borrowed money 
we work closely with our lenders to stay abreast of market and creditor conditions 
our capital expenditures are primarily in areas where we act as operator and have high working interests 
as a result  we do not believe we have significant exposure to joint interest partners who may be unable to fund their portion of any capital program  but we monitor partner situations routinely 
financial highlights our consolidated financial statements reflect total revenue of million on total volumes of bcfe for the year ended december  operating income for the year ended december  was million and included depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense of million  lease operating expense of million and million of compensation expense for stock based compensation granted to employees included in general and administrative costs 
total net other income for the year ended december  was comprised of interest expense net of capitalized interest on our long term debt offset by interest income on short term cash investments

net of available insurance and performance of contractual defense and indemnity obligations  where applicable  management does not believe any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lease operating expense 
lease operating expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this overall decrease was primarily due to cost control measures and asset divestitures 
lease operating expense included workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the year ended december  as compared to workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the same period in production taxes 
production taxes as a percentage of unhedged natural gas  oil and ngl sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to certain production tax credits in the state of texas 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
dd a expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the decrease was due to a decrease in total production and a lower dd a rate for compared to due to the full cost ceiling test impairment charges recognized in the first quarter of  which decreased the full cost pool 
the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe while the rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
based on quarterly ceiling test computations using a twelve month average price computed as an average of first day of the month prices  adjusted for hedges of oil and gas  we were not required to record a write down at december  and no write down occurred during the twelve months ended december  however  based on the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december   at march   the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily related to a million increase in stock based compensation due to the increased stock price  a million increase in salaries  wages and bonuses  a million increase in benefit costs offset by an increase of million in billable field personnel  a million increase in capitalizable geological and geophysical expenses and million of other administrative costs 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  lease operating expense 
lease operating expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this overall increase was primarily due to the south texas constellation  pinedale and petroflow acquisitions as was the first full year of recording expenses 
lease operating expense included workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the year ended december  as compared to workover costs of per mcfe  ad valorem taxes of per mcfe and insurance of per mcfe for the same period in production taxes 
production taxes as a percentage of unhedged natural gas  oil and ngl sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase was the result of production tax credits for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for 
table of contents depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
dd a expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the decrease was due to a decrease in total production and a lower dd a rate for compared to due to the full cost ceiling test impairment charges recognized during the second half of and during the first quarter of  which decreased the full cost pool 
the dd a rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe while the rate for the year ended december  was per mcfe 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
based on the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december   at march   the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million 
the application of the new sec guidance did not impact the ceiling test for the year ended based on the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during the year ended december  and in conjunction with the downward revisions of a portion of our reserves in the third and fourth quarters of  the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the decrease in general and administrative costs incurred in was primarily related to decreases of million in legal fees related to the calpine litigation  which settled during  and an increase of million in billable field personnel offset by a million decrease in capitalizable geological and geophysical expenses  a million increase in salaries and wages resulting from the additional technical personnel hired during and a million increase in bonus expense 
total other expense total other expense includes interest expense  net of interest capitalized  interest income and other income expense  net which increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in total other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense associated with higher amounts of outstanding debt 
long term debt outstanding as of december  was million higher as compared to december  the weighted average interest rate for the twelve months ended december  was compared to for the same period in this increase in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the higher interest rate associated with the senior notes 
other expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in other expense was primarily the result of a million charge related to the settlement of litigation with calpine in for which there were no related expenses during offset by a million increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates on our credit facilities and increased amortization of deferred loan fees and original issue discount related to our credit facilities during the first quarter of provision for income taxes our income tax expense was million 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes differs from the taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effect of state taxes  the non deductibility of certain incentive compensation and a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets 
the company provides for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million  compared to a deferred tax asset of approximately million at december   resulting primarily from the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties and net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent  in part  on generating sufficient taxable income from the production of oil and natural gas properties prior to the expiration of loss carryforwards 
in connection with the planned asset divestitures in the dj basin in colorado and in the sacramento basin in california  the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for these states including nols will not be realized 
therefore  valuation allowances have been established for these items as well as state nols in other jurisdictions in which the company previously operated but has since divested of operating assets 
the company will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity and capital is our operating cash flow 
we also maintain a revolving line of credit  which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow 
operating cash flow 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and the success of our development and exploration activities as well as future acquisitions 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by executing derivative transactions to hedge the change in prices of a portion of our production  thereby mitigating our exposure to price declines  but these transactions may also limit our earnings potential in periods of rising commodity prices 
the effects of these derivative transactions on our natural gas sales are discussed above under results of operations revenues year ended december  compared to the year ended december  natural gas and results of operations revenues year ended december  compared to the year ended december  natural gas 
the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels 
economic conditions and lower commodity prices could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
we will continue to monitor our cash flow and liquidity and  if appropriate  we may consider adjusting our capital expenditure program 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
our amended and restated revolving credit agreement the restated revolver provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit of up to million and matures on july  availability under the restated revolver is restricted to the borrowing base  which is subject to review and adjustment on a semi annual basis and other interim adjustments  including adjustments based on our hedging arrangements as well as asset divestitures 
our borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of reserves as well as the pricing outlook at the time of the redetermination 
a reduction in capital spending could result in a reduced level of reserves thus causing a reduction in the borrowing base 
our borrowing base was confirmed by our lenders in october at million 
in accordance with our agreement  the borrowing base was adjusted in december to million after the successful divestitures of our pinedale and san juan assets 
as of december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our restated revolver 
amounts outstanding under the restated revolver bear interest at specified margins over the london interbank offered rate libor of to 
borrowings under the restated revolver are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets  including a mortgage lien on oil and natural gas properties having at least of the pre tax sec pv reserve value  a guaranty by all of our domestic subsidiaries  and a pledge of of the membership interests of our domestic subsidiaries 
collateralized amounts under the mortgages are subject to semi annual reviews based on updated reserve information 
we are subject to the financial covenants as defined in our credit agreement 
the terms of the credit agreement require us to maintain a minimum current ratio of consolidated current assets  including the unused amount of available borrowing capacity  to consolidated current liabilities  excluding certain non cash obligations  of not less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the terms of the credit agreement also require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of total debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes and noncash items  such as depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment  of not greater than to  calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  measured quarterly after giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and divestitures 
at december   our current ratio was and the leverage ratio was in addition  we are subject to covenants limiting dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  as of february   we had million outstanding  with million available for borrowing under the restated revolver 
the borrowing base will be subject to further adjustment pending the potential dj basin and sacramento basin divestitures 
second lien term loan 
our amended and restated term loan the restated term loan matures on october  on april   we repaid million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under the restated term loan  which bore interest at libor plus with a libor floor of 
in connection with the repayment  we paid an early termination premium of million 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we evaluated the libor floor as an embedded derivative and concluded that because the terms were clearly and closely related to the debt instrument  it did not represent an embedded derivative to be accounted for separately 
as of december   we had million of fixed rate borrowings outstanding bearing interest at under the restated term loan 
the loan is collateralized by second priority liens on substantially all of the company s assets 
we are subject to the financial covenants as defined in our term loan agreement 
we are required under the term loan agreement to maintain a minimum reserve ratio of our total reserve value to total debt of not less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the terms of the agreement also require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of total debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes and noncash items  such as depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment  of not greater than to  calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended 
at december   our reserve coverage ratio was and the leverage ratio was in addition  the company is subject to covenants  including limitations on dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  changes of control  asset sales  and liens on properties 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we also have the right to prepay the fixed rate borrowings outstanding under the restated term loan with a make whole amount at a discount factor equal to plus the us treasury yield security having a maturity closest to the remaining life of the loan 
senior notes 
on april   we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in a private offering 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture the indenture with wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
provisions of the indenture limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or purchase  repurchase  redeem  defease or retire capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  incur liens  create any consensual restriction on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property to us  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the indenture also contains customary events of default 
proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to repay million outstanding under our restated revolver and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under our restated term loan  and to pay for fees and expenses associated with the offering 
interest is payable on the senior notes semi annually on april and october on september   we exchanged all of the privately placed senior notes for registered senior notes which contain terms substantially identical to the terms of the privately placed notes 

table of contents as of december   we had total outstanding borrowings of million and for the year ended december   our weighted average borrowing rate was 
working capital at december   we had a working capital surplus of million as compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  our working capital is affected primarily by fluctuations in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments  deferred taxes associated with hedging activities  cash and cash equivalents balance and our capital spending program 
the surplus for was largely caused by the increases in our receivables and derivative instruments 
as of december   the working capital asset balances of our cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments were approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the accrued liability balance included in the working capital liability was approximately million as of december  cash flows year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
key drivers of net cash provided by operating activities are commodity prices  production volumes and costs and expenses  which primarily include operating costs  taxes other than income taxes  transportation and general and administrative expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a primary source of liquidity and capital used to finance our capital expenditures for the year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this increase was largely due to higher oil  ngl and natural gas prices and increased oil and ngl production during compared to cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for this decrease was largely due to lower oil and natural gas prices and production during compared to for the year ended december   we had net losses of million with a decrease in production of as compared to the year ended december  with net losses of million 
investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spending 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenditures of million for purchases to develop oil and gas properties offset with a decrease in investing activities of million due to asset sales 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we participated in the drilling of gross wells as compared to the drilling of gross wells for the year ended december  cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for  which primarily reflected reduced expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and drilling 
acquisitions of oil and gas properties decreased million and purchases of oil and gas assets decreased million from to as a result of our decision to exercise prudence and caution with our capital spending in order to preserve our liquidity and maximize our financial position during a period of low commodity prices and reduced demand for natural gas 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we participated in the drilling of gross wells as compared to the drilling of gross wells for the year ended december  
table of contents financing activities 
the primary drivers of cash provided by used in financing activities are borrowings and repayments under the restated revolver and equity transactions associated with the exercise of stock options  and the acquisition of treasury shares from employees and directors to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the net increase was primarily related to the borrowings under the restated revolver of million during the year ended december   the net impact of the million issuance of our senior notes and repayment of million under the restated term loan and million under the restated revolver 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period for the net decrease was primarily related to payments of million made in under the restated revolver and million of deferred loan fees related to the restated credit facilities netted with million of borrowings in compared to million of borrowings in in addition  there was a decrease of approximately million in the stock options exercised for the year ended december  compared to commodity price risk  interest rate risk and related hedging activities the energy markets have historically been very volatile and oil  ngl and natural gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices  management hedges oil  ngl and natural gas prices from time to time  primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments  including fixed price swaps  basis swaps  costless collars and put options 
although not risk free  we believe these activities will reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and thereby enable us to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
consistent with this policy  we have entered into a series of natural gas  oil and ngl fixed price swaps and costless collars for each year through our fixed price swap and costless collar agreements require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a notional quantity of oil  ngls  and natural gas without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments were based on expected production from existing wells at inception of the hedge instruments 
borrowings under our restated revolver mature on july  and bear interest at a libor based rate 
to mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates  we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements that expired in december we may enter into additional interest rate swap agreements in the future to mitigate interest rate risk if the costs are not prohibitive 
the following table sets forth the results of commodity fixed price and costless collars and interest rate swap derivative settlements for the year ended december  natural gas quantity settled mmbtu increase decrease in natural gas sales revenue in thousands interest rate swaps increase in interest expense in thousands in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivatives  all derivative instruments  not designated as a normal purchase sale  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge transaction  and depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivative contracts are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair market value of these derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified as earnings in the period s in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item 
we assess the effectiveness of hedging transactions on a quarterly basis  consistent with documented risk management strategy for the particular hedging relationship 
changes in the fair market value of the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges  if any  are included in other income expense 
as of december   our commodity hedge positions were with counterparties that were also lenders in our credit facilities 
this allows us to secure any margin obligation resulting from a negative change in the fair market value of the derivative contracts in connection with our credit obligations and eliminate the need for independent collateral postings 
as of december   we had no deposits for collateral 
capital requirements our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including capitalized internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities of million  capitalized interest of million and corporate and other capital costs of million 
we have plans to execute an organic capital program in of million that can be funded from internally generated cash flows  divestiture proceeds and available cash 
we also have the discretion to use our available borrowing base to fund capital expenditures  including acquisitions 

table of contents commitments and contingencies as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and natural gas properties 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of our contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years were as follows payments due by period total to to beyond in thousands senior secured revolving line of credit second lien term loan senior notes operating leases interest payments on long term debt field service agreements rig commitments total contractual obligations future interest payments were calculated based on interest rates and amounts outstanding at december  asset retirement obligations 
we also had total liabilities of million at december  related to asset retirement obligations that are excluded from the table above 
of the total aro  the current portion was approximately million at december  and was included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of aro was approximately million at december  and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
due to the nature of these obligations  we cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations
