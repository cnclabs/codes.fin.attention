overview our business our company is a leading national specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls operating  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the dressbarn  maurices  and justice brands 
we operate through our subsidiaries over  stores throughout the united states  puerto rico and canada  with annual revenues of over billion 
we classify our businesses into three segments following a brand oriented approach dressbarn  maurices and justice 
the dressbarn segment includes approximately specialty retail and outlet stores  as well as an e commerce operation that was launched in the first quarter of fiscal the dressbarn brand primarily attracts female consumers in the mid s to mid s age range and offers moderate to better quality career and casual fashion to the working woman 
the maurices segment includes approximately specialty retail and outlet stores  and e commerce operations 
the maurices brand offers up to date fashion designed to appeal to the to year old female  with stores primarily concentrated in small markets approximately  to  people 
the justice segment includes approximately specialty retail and outlet stores  e commerce operations  and certain licensed franchises in international territories 
the justice brand stores offer fashionable apparel to girls who are ages to in an environment designed to match the energetic lifestyle of tween girls 
our objectives and risks objectives in fiscal  we completed our organizational transformation into a new holding company structure pursuant to the ascena reorganization 
this new structure is intended to provide us with new strategic options  more operational efficiencies and additional financing flexibility  while at the same time allowing each of our family of retail brands to focus more exclusively on delivering great fashion at affordable prices to enhance the customer experience 
our core strengths include a portfolio of value oriented  lifestyle brands serving the female customer at various levels of maturity  beginning from age to the mid s 
this portfolio of brands is well complemented by a strong and experienced management team  a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet 
despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below  we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue  net income and operating cash flow 
we continue to focus on a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at increasing our profitability by reducing expenses and improving our comparative store sales trends 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  the following store expansion we have been exploring  and will continue to explore  expansion opportunities both within our current market areas and in other regions  including international expansion 
during fiscal  we opened a net stores  including net closings of stores at dressbarn  and net openings of stores at maurices and stores at justice 
during fiscal  we currently plan to open approximately net new stores in the aggregate for all our brands 
during fiscal  our justice brand continued to increase its international presence by opening stores in canada 
the expansion into canada has generated positive results during fiscal and justice plans to open an additional stores in canada during fiscal in addition maurices plans to expand into canada during fiscal  while dressbarn plans to expand into canada in fiscal e commerce over the past couple of years  the company focused on better developing its e commerce channel across brands by leveraging the expertise of the pre existing  e commerce operations of justice 
all of our brands now have e commerce operations 
total e commerce revenues amounted to approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately over the prior year period 
for fiscal  e commerce revenues accounted for of total net sales as compared to in the prior year period 
in addition  our justice brand introduced a line of boys clothing under the name brothers that is currently being sold exclusively on line 
we continue to develop our e commerce platform and believe this will be an on going source of sales growth in future periods 
cost savings initiatives in line with our corporate reorganization plans  we have centralized  and will continue to centralize  certain functions of our brands to realize cost savings and enhance our financial performance 
below is an update of our current plans and accomplishments during the period distribution center consolidation during fiscal  we completed the consolidation of our dressbarn distribution center in suffern  ny into a more technologically advanced distribution center located at our justice division in ohio 
payroll department consolidation during fiscal  we completed the centralization of all payroll departments into one function located at our maurices home office in duluth  minnesota  and outsourced the processing of payroll services and hris to a third party service provider 
information technology department consolidation during fiscal  we completed the centralization of our various information technology departments  along with the consolidation of our five data centers  into one scalable platform located at our justice brand in ohio 
financial systems consolidation during fiscal  we launched an initiative to standardize certain of our financial systems and processes across brands  including a common general ledger  financial planning and consolidations platform 
the project is not expected to be completed until the end of fiscal  and is expected to contribute incremental cost savings beginning at that time 
we continue to explore developing additional shared resource centers among brands  which we believe will lead to increased efficiency in future periods 
risks there are trends and other factors  including those described below  which we face as a women s and girls specialty apparel retailer that could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations  see part i  item a risk factors of the fiscal k 
general economic conditions 
our performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending 
some of the factors negatively impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  wages and high unemployment  high consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on severe market declines such as in residential real estate markets  increased taxation  higher fuel  energy and other prices  increasing interest rates  and low consumer confidence 
in addition  the recent extreme volatility in our financial markets related  in part  to the downgrade in the credit rating of us government issued debt could also negatively impact the levels of future discretionary consumer spending 
while the us and certain other international economies have improved since the global financial crisis experienced in fall  a prolonged economic downturn and slow recovery  including high rates of unemployment  rising commodity prices and declining real estate market values  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
weather conditions 
weather conditions can affect our net sales because inclement weather may discourage travel or require temporary store closures  thereby reducing customer traffic 
unseasonably warmer weather during typically colder months or unseasonably colder weather during typically warmer months can also affect the seasonal composition and demand for our merchandise 
price increases 
the raw materials used to manufacture our products  in particular cotton  and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs  are subject to availability constraints and price volatility 
we have recently seen an increase in such costs 
in response to these price increases  we have moderately increased merchandise prices on certain items in each of our brands and may  in the future  need to further increase merchandise prices in order to maintain our merchandise margins 
consequently  higher product costs could have a negative effect on our gross profit margin and increased selling prices could have a negative effect on our sales volume 
seasonality of business 
the company s business is typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back to school shopping periods 
in particular  the dressbarn and maurices brands have historically experienced substantially lower earnings in the second fiscal quarter ending in january than during the three other fiscal quarters  reflecting the intense promotional environment that generally has characterized the holiday shopping season in recent years 
justice sales and operating profits tend to be significantly higher during the fall season which occurs during the first and second quarters of the company s fiscal year  as this includes the back to school period and the holiday selling period which is focused on gift giving merchandise 
in addition  the company s operating results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays  and changes in merchandise mix 
competition 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented  with numerous competitors  including department stores  off price retailers  specialty stores  discount stores  mass merchandisers and internet based retailers  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
many of our competitors are able to engage in aggressive promotions  reducing their selling prices 
some of our competitors include walmart  macy s  jcpenney  kohl s  old navy  aeropostale  target and sears 
other competitors may move into the markets that we serve 
our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts  and to changes in customer tastes and preferences 
if we fail to compete successfully  we could face lower net sales and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers  which could result in decreased profitability 
we believe that we have established and reinforced our image as a source of fashion and value by focusing on our target customers  and by offering superior customer service and convenience 
customer tastes and fashion trends 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
summary of financial performance operating results in fiscal  we reported net sales of billion  net income of million and net income per diluted share of 
this compares to net sales of billion  net income of million and net income per diluted share of in fiscal our operating performance for fiscal was principally affected by a increase in net sales  mainly due to the inclusion of justice for the full year period compared to a partial period in the prior year 
we also experienced across the board increases in comparable stores sales  as well as strong growth in our e commerce operations 
on a reported basis  the sales growth in fiscal was muted due to the inclusion of approximately million of sales in fiscal due to an extra week in the company s fiscal year 
in addition to the overall increase in net sales  we experienced an increase in gross profit percentage of basis points to  which principally reflected higher merchandise margins resulting from sales of merchandise with selected price increases and the leveraging of buying and occupancy costs due to the comparable store sales increases 
sg a expenses increased by million  or basis points to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of justice for the full year period compared to a partial period in the prior year  which only included sg a expenses from the merger date of november  contributing to the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales were increased marketing and incentive compensation costs related to the better than planned earnings results  an increase in the professional services related to e commerce growth  as well as an increase in operating expenses attributable to our cost savings initiatives  which we believe will lead to increased efficiency in future periods 
net income and net income per diluted share increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this was primarily due to a million increase in operating income  offset in part by a million increase in the provision for income taxes 
the increase in the provision for income taxes was driven by the overall increase in pretax income coupled with a basis point increase in our effective tax rate 
financial condition and liquidity our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of our business results 
we ended fiscal in a net cash and investments position total cash and cash equivalents  plus short term and non current investments less total debt of million  compared to million as of the end of fiscal the improvement in our financial position was primarily due to our operating cash flows  partially offset by our treasury stock repurchases  capital expenditures and the prepayment of debt 
our equity increased to billion as of july   compared to billion as of july   primarily due to our net income during fiscal  offset in part by our share repurchase activity 
we generated million of cash from operations during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  we used some of our cash availability to prepay the mortgage on our suffern  ny facility resulting in a cash outflow of approximately million and to support our common stock repurchase program and to reinvest in our business through capital spending 
in particular  we used million to repurchase million shares of common stock 
we also used million for capital expenditures primarily associated with our retail store expansion and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure 
transactions affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition the comparability of the company operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions  including the tween brands merger that occurred in november of fiscal  as defined in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  and certain pretax charges related to extinguishments of debt  a loss on the sale of a owned investment  and certain merger and integration related costs

net sales

on a consolidated basis  comparable store sales increased during fiscal the sales growth in fiscal was muted due to the inclusion of approximately million of sales in fiscal due to an extra week in the company s fiscal year

dressbarn net sales 
the net increase primarily reflects an increase of million  or  in comparable store sales during fiscal  an increase of million in revenues from e commerce operations  which commenced in fiscal  offset by a million decrease in non comparable stores sales  primarily driven by a decrease related to net store closings in fiscal  and a million decrease in net sales in fiscal  due to the inclusion of the rd week of sales in fiscal maurices net sales

cost of goods sold increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit  which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher merchandise margins resulting from sales of merchandise with selected price increases and the leveraging of buying and occupancy costs due to the comparable store sales increases 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors  including changes in the relative sales mix among brands  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and level of promotional activities  and fluctuations in material costs 
these factors  among others  may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year 
we anticipate that current macroeconomic challenges  including escalating commodity costs  fuel costs and energy and other prices  could negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross profit percentages in fiscal see item a risk factors for further discussion

liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations  million of availability under our credit agreement as defined below  available cash and cash equivalents  investments and other available financing options 
these sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements  including working capital requirements  retail store expansion  construction and renovation of stores  any future dividend requirements  investment in technological infrastructure  acquisitions  debt repayment  stock repurchases  any future debt requirements  contingent liabilities including uncertain tax positions and other corporate activities 
management believes that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our operating  capital requirements and any debt service for the foreseeable future 
as discussed in the debt section below  we had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement as of july  as discussed further below  we may elect to draw on our credit agreement or other potential sources of financing for  among other things  a material acquisition  settlement of a material contingency including uncertain tax positions or a material adverse business development  as well as for other general corporate business purposes 
we believe that our credit agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution 
in particular  as of july   there were five financial institutions participating in the credit facility  with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of approximately 
management has no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future 
debt credit agreement see note of the audited consolidated financial statements regarding ascena s credit agreement 
as of july   we had no borrowings outstanding and million available under the credit agreement 
the amount available under the credit agreement is net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
as of july   the company also had issued million of private label letters of credit relating to the importation of merchandise 
our credit agreement has financial covenants with respect to a fixed charge coverage ratio  which is defined as a ratio of consolidated ebitdar less capital expenditures to consolidated fixed charges 
for such purposes  consolidated ebitdar is defined generally as net income plus i income tax expense  ii interest expense  iii depreciation and amortization expense and iv rent expense 
consolidated fixed charges are defined generally as the sum of a cash interest expense  b rent expense  c cash tax expense  d capital lease payments  e mandatory cash contributions to any employee benefit plan and f any restricted payments paid in cash 
we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio for any period of four fiscal quarters of at least to 
as of july   the actual fixed charge coverage ratio was to 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement as of july   and expect to be in compliance in all periods during the next twelve months 
in addition to the above  the credit agreement contains customary negative covenants  subject to negotiated exceptions  on i liens and guarantees  ii investments  iii indebtedness  iv significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions  v dispositions  vi restricted payments and certain other restrictive agreements 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  such as payment defaults  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency  the occurrence of a defined change in control  or the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of the company s business 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
as collateral security under the credit agreement and the guarantees thereof  the company and the subsidiary guarantors have granted to the administrative agent for the benefit of the lenders  a first priority lien on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets  including  without limitation  certain domestic inventory  but excluding real estate 
mortgage in connection with the purchase of the company s suffern  new york facility  a subsidiary of the company borrowed million under a rate mortgage loan 
this mortgage loan the mortgage was collateralized by a mortgage lien on such facility  of which the major portion is the company s corporate offices and the dressbarn brand s offices 
in july  the company prepaid the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage in full 
the payment of approximately million resulted in a million pretax loss on the extinguishment of debt in fiscal  which has been disclosed separately in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of operations 
payment of dividends our credit agreement does not permit cash dividends  but allows us to pay stock dividends  provided that at the time of and immediately after giving effect to the stock dividend  i there is no default or event of default  ii the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement is not less than to  and iii borrowings under the credit agreement do not exceed of the total available borrowings such that availability as defined in the credit agreement is not less than of the aggregate revolving commitments as defined in the credit agreement 
dividends are payable when declared by our board of directors 
currently  the board of directors does not plan to pay any dividends 
common stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the stock repurchase program 
under the stock repurchase program  purchases of shares of our common stock may be made at our discretion from time to time  subject to overall business and market conditions 
in fiscal  million shares of common stock were repurchased by the company at an aggregate cost of million under the repurchase program 
the remaining availability under the stock repurchase program was approximately million at july  in fiscal  million shares of common stock were repurchased by the company at an aggregate cost of million 
in fiscal  million shares of common stock were repurchased by the company at an aggregate cost of million 
on september   the company s board of directors authorized an expansion of its existing stock repurchase program by million 
when taken with the existing availability under the stock repurchase program  the availability to repurchase shares of common stock was increased to million as of the date of authorization 
repurchased shares normally are retired and treated as authorized but unissued shares 
contractual and other obligations firm commitments the following table summarizes certain of the company aggregate contractual obligations as of july   and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the company liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and  if necessary  availability under its million credit facility or other potential sources of financing 
payments due by period contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total millions operating leases inventory purchase commitments other commitments total the following is a description of the company material  firmly committed contractual obligations as of july  operating lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under non cancelable leases for the company real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world 
in addition to such amounts  the company is normally required to pay taxes  insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties  and inventory purchase commitments represent the company legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices 
excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of july  this liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the above table because the company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled  if ever 
the above table also excludes the following i amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of july   as these items will be paid within one year  and ii non current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them eg  deferred revenue or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a purchase obligation as the term is used herein eg  deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items 
the company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur 
see notes and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the company contingent commitments not included in the above table  including obligations under employment agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company off balance sheet firm commitments  which include outstanding letters of credit and private label letters of credit  amounted to approximately million as of july  the company does not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
market risk management the company is exposed to a variety of market based risks  representing our potential exposure to losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
these market risks include  but are not limited to  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our expanding canadian and other international operations  changes in interest rates  and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
consequently  in the normal course of business  we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks  including considering  at times  the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of the end of fiscal  the company did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk management we currently do not have any significant risks to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates 
purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores normally are transacted in us dollars 
in addition  our wholly owned international retail operations represented less than of our consolidated revenues for fiscal in the future  as our international operations continue to expand  we would consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage any significant risks to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management our company currently has no debt outstanding 
however  we have approximately million of borrowing availability under our credit agreement 
borrowings under our credit agreement are subject to interest charges at variable rates 
accordingly  to the extent we borrow under the credit agreement  we are subject to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms and conditions of our credit agreement 
investment risk management as of the end of fiscal  our company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million  primarily invested in money market funds and commercial paper with original maturities of days or less 
the company other significant investments included million of short term investments  primarily municipal bonds with original maturities greater than days  and million of non current investments  primarily municipal bonds and auction rate securities ars issued through various municipalities with maturities greater than one year 
we maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with well known and stable financial institutions  however  there were significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at these financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits at the end of fiscal this represents a concentration of credit risk 
with the current financial environment and the instability of some financial institutions  we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future 
however  there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date 
our ars of million at july  are primarily aaa aaa rated with the vast majority collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program with the remaining securities backed by monoline insurance companies 
these ars may pose a higher risk of future impairment by us as a result of the illiquidity associated with these securities 
during february  a substantial number of auctions failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
in the case of a failed auction  the auction rate security is deemed not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so without a potential loss of principal 
we believe that the current lack of liquidity in the ars market will not have an impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth initiatives  for that reason  we have no intent to sell  nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process  redemption by the issuer or  if necessary  maturity 
these securities are currently paying in accordance with their contractual terms  and as such  management does not believe the underlying securities or collateral have been permanently affected 
we evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
such evaluation involves a variety of considerations  including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers 
factors we considered include i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  ii the financial condition  credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the length of time to maturity  iv future economic conditions and market forecasts  v our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value  and vi an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell our investment before recovery of market value 
there has been no other than temporary impairments recorded on our investment securities during any of the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the company estimates are often based on complex judgments  probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
it is also possible that other professionals  applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts 
the company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr for a discussion of all of the company significant accounting policies  see notes and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and necessary markdowns to clear slow moving merchandise  which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value 
consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns  aging of inventories  historical sales trends  and the impact of market trends and economic conditions 
estimates of markdown requirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity  quality and mix of products in inventory  as well as changes in consumer preferences  market and economic conditions 
the company s historical estimates of these costs and its markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results 
reserves for inventory shrinkage  representing the risk or physical loss of inventory  are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts 
sales returns reserves a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales return reserves  which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized 
in particular  retail revenue  including e commerce sales  is reduced by estimates of returns 
in determining estimates of returns  management analyzes historical trends  seasonal results  current economic and market conditions and store performance 
the company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis 
the company historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  are not amortized 
rather  goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess 
in addition  in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value 
the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million in its maurices segment in each of fiscal and to reduce the carrying value of the studio y trade name to its estimated fair value 
the company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the results of the impairment assessment as of june   the company confirmed that the fair value of its reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and that there were no reporting units that were at risk of impairment 
additionally  there has been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill during any of the three fiscal years presented 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment  along with other long lived assets  are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in evaluating long lived assets for recoverability  we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value  considering external market participant assumptions 
assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining future cash flows  the company takes various factors into account  including changes in merchandising strategy  the emphasis on retail store cost controls  the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending  and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising 
since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance  there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation and employee healthcare benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
such liabilities are capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
as of july  and july   these reserves were million and million  respectively 
the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to insurance and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
the company is self insured for expenses related to its employee medical and dental plans  and its workers compensation plan  up to certain thresholds 
claims filed  as well as claims incurred but not reported  are accrued based on management s estimates  using information received from plan administrators  historical analysis and other relevant data 
the company has stop loss insurance coverage for individual claims in excess of  at dressbarn and maurices and  at justice 
the company believes its accruals for claims and contingencies are adequate based on information currently available 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded accruals for claims and contingencies 
stock based compensation the company expenses all share based payments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
stock options stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to or exceeding fair market value at the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events 
the key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option  the expected stock price volatility factor  the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate  among others 
generally  once stock option values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used are different from the actuals 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management  including estimates of the above black scholes assumptions 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants  or if there are changes in market conditions  stock based compensation expense and the company results of operations could be materially impacted 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus the company grants restricted shares of common stock and service based rsus to certain of its employees 
in addition  the company grants performance based rsus to senior executives and other key executives  and certain other employees of the company 
the fair values of restricted stock shares and rsus are based on the fair value of unrestricted common stock 
compensation expense for performance based rsus is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable  which involves judgment on the part of management 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes ie  deferred tax assets and liabilities  current taxes payable refunds receivable and tax expense are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between us generally accepted accounting principles and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss  capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
the company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur  or circumstances change  that warrant adjustments to those balances 
in determining the income tax provision for financial reporting purposes  the company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
if the company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  it recognizes the tax benefit 
the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement  presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
these assessments can be complex and require significant judgment  and the company often obtains assistance from external advisors 
to the extent that the company estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
if the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit  the company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if i there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not  ii the statute of limitations expires  or iii there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency 
uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months 
interest and penalties  if any  are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the company consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company income taxes 
contingencies we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  including certain litigations  contractual disputes  employee relation matters  various tax audits  and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes 
we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable 
in addition  if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability  we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
management considers many factors in making these assessments 
as the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
as a result  the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods
