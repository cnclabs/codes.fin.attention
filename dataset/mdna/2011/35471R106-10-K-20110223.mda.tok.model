as of december   our term loan of million bore interest at a variable rate of libor plus basis points  with a floor on libor  which was fixed at per annum for its initial three year term with an interest rate swap agreement  and therefore  the fair value of this instrument is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that we mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the term loan through the interest rate swap agreement for the initial three year term of the loan 
this interest rate swap agreement was our only derivative instrument as of december  and the term loan had an initial three year term that was scheduled to mature on october  in addition  we had the right to extend the initial maturity date for up to two successive one year periods  or until october  if both extensions had been exercised 
upon maturity or repayment if earlier  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
on february   we repaid the term loan in its entirety from the proceeds of the new revolver and terminated the term loan 
on february   we also paid approximately million from the proceeds of the new revolver to terminate the interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on our term loan 
additional information about the term loan is described under the term loan in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the counterparty to our derivative arrangement is rbs citizens  na  which has a senior unsecured debt credit rating of a by moody s 
as a result  we did not anticipate that the counterparty would fail to meet its obligations 
however  there was no assurance that we would be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or that we would ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies
