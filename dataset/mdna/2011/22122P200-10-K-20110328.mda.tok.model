item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report 
business overview system wide restaurants fiscal year company owned franchise total company owned franchise total company owned franchise total restaurants at beginning of period a company owned sold to franchisee new restaurants opened restaurants permanently closed restaurants at end of period a includes three locations that are classified as discontinued operations 
as of december   there were company owned and franchised premium convenience restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and the united arab emirates uae 
during fiscal  two new franchised restaurants opened  one at logan airport in boston and another one in the uae and we closed three company owned restaurants  in great neck  new york  darien  connecticut  and ann arbor  michigan 
during fiscal  two franchised restaurants closed  one in minnesota and another one in the uae and we sold thirteen company owned restaurants in the district of columbia to a franchisee see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we closed one company owned restaurant in illinois subsequent to fiscal our restaurants offer innovative  savory  made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  breakfast wraps  cosi squagels  hot melts  flatbread pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  bottled beverages including premium still and sparkling water  teas  alcoholic beverages  and other 
table of contents specialty coffees and beverages 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 
we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital  and we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth 
we also continue to explore strategic opportunities with our cosi pronto our grab and go concept and full service concepts in educational establishments  airports  train stations and other public venues that meet our operating and financial criteria 
recent developments rights offering and private placement of common stock on january   we completed a shareholders rights offering to our shareholders of record as of november  we issued a total of  shares of our par value common stock at a subscription price of per share 
in conjunction with the rights offering  our executive officers and outside directors purchased an aggregate  shares of our par value common stock  at a subscription price of per share  through a private placement 
we received  in the aggregate  net proceeds of approximately million from the rights offering and the private placement of common stock 
sale of restaurants on april   we completed the sale of thirteen restaurants and related assets in the washington  dc market to capitol c restaurants llc capitol c for million 
the sale was made pursuant to an asset purchase and sale agreement dated april   by and among the company  cosi sandwich bar  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  capitol c and capitol c holdings llc holdings  the parent company of capitol c 
the restaurants will be operated under franchise agreements between the company and capitol c  and holdings has entered into a development agreement to open six additional cosi restaurants in the district of columbia area 
under the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement  million of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing and million is payable to cosi under a subordinated secured promissory note and will be paid in weekly installments  commencing january  based on a percentage of net sales  with a final balloon payment for the balance of the note due on may  the balance of million is being held in escrow and will be paid to cosi if capitol c achieves a certain sales target at any time during the three year period following the closing date of the transaction 
disbursement from the escrow  either in 
table of contents full or in part  is based on a formula that compares then current trailing twelve month sales to a sales baseline and applies the resulting percentage to the escrow amount 
the disbursement calculation can be applied up to three times at cosi s sole discretion over the three year period 
as a result of this sale  we disposed of approximately million in net furniture  fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  and recognized a gain on the sale of assets of approximately million during the second quarter of fiscal  including approximately million in unamortized landlord allowances and reversal of straight line rent expense 
if the disbursement  either in full or in part  is made to us from the million held in escrow  we will recognize an additional gain from the sale of these assets at that time 
in addition  as a result of this sale  our cash position increased by million  other non current assets and current receivables increased by approximately million and million  respectively  due to the million promissory note  which was discounted to its december  present value of approximately million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
there have been no material changes in the application of our most critical accounting policies and estimates  judgments and assumptions during fiscal long lived assets asc property  plant  equipment requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of this standard has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level periodically and record an impairment loss whenever we determine impairment factors are present 
we consider a history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
restaurants are not considered for impairment during the ramp up period before they enter the comparable restaurant base  unless specific circumstances warrant otherwise 
lease termination charges asc exit or disposal cost obligations requires companies to recognize a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  rather than at the time of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that 
table of contents have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with asc leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations  rent abatements during the construction period and any other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense calculation 
landlord allowances in accordance with asc leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
stock based compensation expense in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense according to the fair value recognition provision  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that all the resulting compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of grant 
the weighted average fair values of the stock options granted through  the last time we issued stock options  were determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets that relate primarily to net operating loss carry forwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that we could realize these deferred tax assets 
we have adopted the provisions of asc income taxes beginning in fiscal no adjustment was made to the beginning retained earnings balance  as the ultimate deductibility of all tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
no interest or penalties have been accrued relative to tax positions due to the company having either a tax loss or net operating loss carry forwards to offset any taxable income in all subject years 
as a result  no liability for uncertain tax positions has been recorded 
revenue restaurant net sales 
our company owned restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 
franchise fees and royalties 
franchise fees and royalties includes fees earned from franchise agreements entered into with area developers and franchise operators  as well as royalties received based on sales generated at franchised restaurants 
we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which a franchise location opens or when fees are forfeited as a result of a termination of an area developer agreement 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 

table of contents gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards 
comparable restaurant sales in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for full months 
we remove from the comparable restaurant base for the period any restaurant that is temporarily shut down for remodeling during the period

we do expect to incur capital costs associated with remodeling and maintenance of existing company owned restaurants during fiscal as we currently have no credit facility or available line of credit  we expect to fund any required restaurant remodeling and capital maintenance costs on existing company owned locations or required capital for new restaurant development  if any  from cash and cash equivalents on hand  expected cash flows generated by existing company owned restaurants  and expected franchise fees and royalties 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and expected franchise fees and royalties will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs and remodeling and maintenance of existing restaurant locations for the next twelve months and for new company owned restaurant development  if any 
our conclusion is based on our expected performance for fiscal and includes a sensitivity analysis that projects varying levels of decline in consumer demand 
the range of levels selected was based on our reasonable expectation of demand given the seasonality of our historical performance and the potential impact the current economic environment may have on consumer spending 
in analyzing our capital cash outlays during fiscal and fiscal  and  respectively  of our capital expenditures were spent on repairs and maintenance associated with existing company owned locations 
if our company owned restaurants do not generate the cash flow levels that we expect  if new franchised restaurants do not open according to our expectations  if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  if we incur significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond our normal liquidity needs  or if we experience other unforeseen circumstances then  in order to fund our cash requirements  we may have to cease new company owned restaurant development efforts and may have to effect further labor reductions in general and administrative support functions  seek to sell certain company owned locations to franchisees and or other third parties  seek other sources of financing or take other actions necessitated by the impact of such unanticipated circumstances 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing or sell company owned locations to franchisees or other third parties or that we will be able to do so in a timely manner and on acceptable terms to meet our requirements 
given the continued instability in the credit and financial markets  it may be difficult for the company to obtain additional financing and for franchisees to obtain the financing necessary to open restaurants or to acquire company owned locations 
an inability to access additional sources of liquidity to fund our cash needs could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and interest that we may pay on debt 
we have no derivative financial commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
during fiscal  we held no short term investments and  as a result  a hypothetical one percentage point interest change from those in effect during fiscal would not have resulted in a fluctuation of interest income 
in fiscals and  interest income was million and million  respectively 
during fiscals and  we did not have any significant debt 
foreign currency risk as of fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our business are food and labor costs 
some of our food costs are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices
