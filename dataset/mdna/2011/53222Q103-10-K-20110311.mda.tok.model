the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other fac tors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances and customer chargebacks  inventory mark down provisions  impairment of tangible and intangible assets  stock option expense  derivative valuation  accruals related to the company s tax positions and tax valuation allowances 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions and under different conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are thos e that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third party suppliers 
inventory also includes finished goods  work in process and raw materials related to the company s manufacture of sterling silver products 
inventory is priced by the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
the company estimates the selling price of its inventory on a product by product basis based on the current selling environment and considering the various available channels of distribution eg wholesale specialty store  off price retailers  etc 
or the internet and catalog 
if the estimated selling price is lower than the inventory s cost  the company reduces the value of inventory to its net realizable value 
if a variance exists between the company s estimated selling prices and act ual selling prices  material fluctuations in gross margin could occur 
historically  the company s adjustments to inventory have been appropriate and have not resulted in material unexpected charges 
receivables the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the initial and on going creditworthiness of the company s customers 
the company also maintains an allowance for anticipated customer deductions 
the allowances for deductions are primarily based on contracts with customers 
however  in certain cases the company does not have a formal contract and therefore  customer deductions are non contractual 
to evaluate the reasonableness of non contractual customer deductions  the company analyzes currently available information an d historical trends of deductions 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers or general economic conditions were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or sell the company s products at reasonable sales prices  or the company s estimate of non contractual deductions varied from actual deductions  revisions to allowances would be required  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
historically  the company s allowances have been appropriate and have not resulted in material unexpected charges 
intangible assets and long lived assets intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are subject to an annual impairment assessment 
long lived assets  including intangible assets deemed to have finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may have been impaired 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
when impairment indicators are present  the company compares the carrying value of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
th e company considered indicators of impairment of its long lived assets and determined that no such indicators were present at december  revenue recognition the company sells products wholesale  to retailers and distributors  and retail  directly to the consumer through the company s retail direct operations 
wholesale sales and retail direct sales are recognized when title passes to the customer 
wholesale sales are recognized at shipping point and retail direct sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities 
employee stock options the company accounts for its stock options in accordance with asc topic no 
 awards classified as equity  which requires the measurement of compensation expense for all share based compensation granted to employees and non employee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the related service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility of the company s common stock and the risk free interest rate 
changes in these subjective input assumptions can materially af fect the fair value estimate of the company s stock options on the date of the option grant 
the company historically has not issued options which would be variable awards under asc income taxes the company applies the provisions of asc topic no 
 income taxes  for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the company s financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken 
the valuation allowance is also calculated in accordance with the provisions of asc topic no 
 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
derivatives the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedges and have been designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes have no net impact on earnings to the extent the derivative is considered perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes  changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are i cash provided by operating activities and ii amounts available under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s primary uses of funds consist of cash used in operating activities  capital expenditures and payment of principal and interest on its debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to  at december   working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  and the current ratio was to at december  compared to to at december  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in borrowings was primarily attributable to the use of cash from operations to pay down the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the company believes that availability under the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations is sufficient to fund the company s operations 
however  if circumstances were to adversely change  the company may seek alternative sources of liquidity including debt and equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that any such alternative sources would be available or sufficient 
the company closely monitors the creditworthiness of its customers 
based upon the evaluation of changes in customers creditworthiness  the company may modify credit limits and or terms of sale 
the company has not been materially affected by the bankruptcy or liquidation of any of its customers to date 
however  notwithstanding the company s efforts to monitor its customers financi al condition  the company may be materially affected in the future 
in  wal mart stores  inc including sam s club accounted for of the company s sales 
a material reduction of product orders by wal mart stores  inc could have significant adverse effects on the company s business and operating results and ultimately the company s liquidity  including the loss of predictability and volume production efficiencies associated with such a large customer
