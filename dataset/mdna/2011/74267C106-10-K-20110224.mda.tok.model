item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  pra  company  we  us and our refer to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses  and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses 
incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for losses of prior periods 
the estimation of professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  can vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the claim and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and  for medical professional liability  the trend of health care costs 
professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
our reserves are established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates  claims frequency  historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation  general economic trends  the legal and political environment  and the conclusions reached by our internal actuaries 
we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data 
our internal actuaries perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on at least a semi annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries 
we also engage consulting actuaries to review our data semi annually and provide us with their observations regarding our data and the adequacy of our established reserve  believing that the consulting actuaries provide an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends 

table of contents in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year we rely significantly on the loss assumptions embedded within our pricing 
because of the historically volatile nature of professional liability losses  we establish the initial loss estimates at a level which is approximately to above our pricing assumptions 
this difference recognizes the volatility of the professional liability loss environment and the risk in determining pricing parameters 
as each accident year matures  we analyze reserves in a variety of ways and use multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses  including bornhuetter ferguson paid and reported method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method a brief description of each method follows 
bornhuetter ferguson method 
we use both the paid and the reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year initial expected losses being the first established case and ibnr reserves for a specific accident year and partial weight to paid to date losses 
the reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current reported losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development and reported development method 
these methods use historical  cumulative losses paid losses for the paid development method  reported losses for the reported development method by accident year and develop those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment and case reserving environment for the reported development method  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
average paid value and average reported value methods 
in these methods  average claim cost data paid claim cost for the average paid value method and reported claim cost for the reported value method is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data 
claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level 
the average claim cost after rounding and adjustment  if necessary  to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and alae 
backward recursive development method 
this method is an extrapolation on the movements in case reserve adequacy in order to estimate unpaid loss costs 
historical data showing incremental changes to case reserves over progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the ratio of case reserve values at successive maturities 
historical claims payment data showing the additional payments in progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the portion of a case reserve paid in the following period 
starting from the most mature period  after which all the case reserve is paid and the case reserve is exhausted  the next prior ultimate development factor for the prior case reserve can be calculated as the case factor times the established ultimate development factor plus the paid factor 
for each successive prior maturity  the ultimate development factor is calculated similarly 
the result of multiplying the ultimate development factor times the case reserve is the total indicated unpaid amount 
generally  methods such as the bornhuetter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year  we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods  as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
each of these methods treats our assumptions differently  and thus provides a different perspective for our reserve review 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends 

table of contents we segment our reserves by accident year  which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability 
as claims are incurred reported and claim payments are made  they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes 
we also segment our reserves by reserve type case reserves and ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established by our claims department based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs often referred to as expected losses that will be paid on reported claims 
case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised  reported loss is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date 
ibnr reserves represent our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us and future developments on losses that have been reported to us 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management and is not driven by formulaic determination 
for each partition of our business  we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
this series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
we also utilize these selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers  based on the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
an overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates 
our net reserve estimate is the sum of the gross reserve point estimate and the estimated reinsurance recovery 
we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our net reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried net reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion the claims environment in which we and others in our industry operate is inherently uncertain 
the development of a statistical distribution models the uncertainty as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data 
the distributions represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes and should not be confused with a range of best estimates 
given the number of factors considered  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 

table of contents the following table presents additional information about net favorable loss development in thousands net favorable loss development recognized loss development as of beginning of year loss reserves any change in our estimate of losses is reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 
appropriate reserves are established for any balances we believe may not be collected 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
also  we estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is based in part on losses reimbursed or to be reimbursed under the agreement 
any adjustments are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to circumstances or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer  however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our claim for reimbursement from them 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity 

table of contents investment valuations we record a substantial portion of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below 
the distribution of our investments based on gaap fair value hierarchies is as follows distribution by gaap fair value hierarchy december  level level level total investments fair value cost or cash surrender value total investments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
all of our fixed maturity and equity securities investments are carried at fair value 
our short term securities are carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
because of the number of securities we own and the complexity and cost of developing accurate fair values internally  we utilize independent pricing services to assist us in establishing fair values 
the pricing services provide fair values based on exchange traded prices  if available 
if an exchange traded price is not available  the pricing services  if possible  provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models 
pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate the fair value for our security 
the pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models 
the pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class 
determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data 
the pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted 
we review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied price versus market yields observed in the market place 
if a supplied value is deemed unreasonable  we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and will make adjustments if deemed necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted any values supplied by the pricing services 
the pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange traded price or multiple observable inputs are available 
as a result  the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others  depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities 
as of december   fair values for our equity and a portion of our short term securities have been determined using an exchange traded price 
there is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange traded price 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued using an exchange traded price as level securities 
with the exception of certain government bonds  most fixed income securities do not trade daily and thus exchange traded prices are generally not available for these securities 
however  market information often referred to as observable inputs or market data  including but not limited to  last reported trade  non binding broker quotes  bids  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  offers  and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds  cash flow and loan performance data is available for most of our fixed income securities 
a large portion of our fixed income securities are valued at fair value using available market information 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify any securities that have been valued based on multiple market observable inputs as level securities 
when a pricing service does not provide a value  management estimates fair value using either a single non binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs 
the process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities that are valued using limited observable inputs as level securities 
we hold interests in private investment funds which hold debt and equity securities 
we value these investments  which at december  total million or approximately of total investments  based on quarterly net asset values provided to us by fund managers  which approximate fair value 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify interests valued in this manner as level securities 
our investments that are not valued at fair value include interests in private investment funds having a carrying value of million at december   valued at cost 
business owned life insurance policies having a carrying value of million at december   valued at cash surrender value 
interests in tax credit partnerships having a carrying value of approximately million at december   valued under the equity method 
other business interests having a carrying value of million at december   valued under the equity method based on the latest financial statements of the entity 
federal home loan bank capital stock having a carrying value of million at december   valued at cost 

table of contents investment impairments we evaluate our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value that represent other than temporary impairments otti 
in all instances we consider an impairment to be an other than temporary impairment if we intend to sell the security or if we believe we will be required to sell the security before we fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
otherwise  we consider various factors in our evaluation  depending upon the type of security  as discussed below 
for equity securities  we consider the following the length of time for which the fair value of the investment has been less than its recorded basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer underlying the investment  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
for debt securities  we consider whether we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security  based upon consideration of some or all of the following third party research and credit rating reports  the current credit standing of the issuer  including credit rating downgrades extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with an investment or its issuer  our internal assessments and those of our external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment  which can cause us to believe the investment is more or less likely to recover its value than other investments with a similar structure  for asset backed securities  the origination date of the underlying loans  the remaining average life  the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future  and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

table of contents in assessing whether we expect to recover the cost basis of debt securities  particularly asset backed securities  we must make a number of assumptions regarding matters that will affect the cash flows that we expect to receive from the security in future periods 
these judgments are subjective in nature and may subsequently be proved to be inaccurate 
we evaluate our investments in private investment funds for otti by considering whether there has been a decline in fair value below the recorded value 
we receive reports from the funds at least quarterly which provide us a net asset value nav for our interest in the fund 
the nav is based on the fair values of securities held by the fund as determined by the fund manager 
determining whether there has been a decline in fair value involves assumptions and estimates 
we consider the most recent nav provided  the performance of the fund relative to the market  the stated objectives of the fund  and cash flows expected from the fund and audit results in considering whether an otti exists 
our investments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for otti by comparing cash flow projections of future operating results of the underlying projects generating the tax credits to our recorded basis  and considering our ability to utilize the tax credits from the investments 
we also evaluate our holdings of federal home loan bank fhlb securities for impairment 
we consider the current capital status of the fhlb  whether the fhlb is in compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements  and the reported operating results of the current period 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries which are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs each reporting period  and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
deferred taxes deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes 
our temporary differences principally relate to loss reserves  unearned premiums  deferred policy acquisition costs  unrealized investment gains losses and investment impairments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized 
we review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences  carryback capacity  future taxable income including its capital and operating characteristics and tax planning strategies 
goodwill we make at least an annual assessment as to whether the value of our goodwill asset is impaired 
management evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and before the annual evaluation if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
we evaluate goodwill as one reporting unit because we operate in a single operating segment and our segment components are economically similar 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit on the evaluation date based on our market capitalization and an expected premium that would be paid to acquire control of our company a control premium 
we then perform a sensitivity analysis using a range of historical stock prices and control premiums 
we concluded in   and that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary 

table of contents proassurance overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are primarily derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  which principally write medical and other professional liability insurance 
corporate strategy our mission is to be the preferred source of professional liability protection by providing unparalleled claims defense  highly responsive customer service and innovative risk management while maintaining our commitment to long term financial strength 
according to am best s analysis of data  we are the largest independently publicly traded medical professional liability specialist insurance writer in the nation 
our customer focus combined with our financial strength  strong reputation and proven ability to manage claims  has enabled us to expand our operations while maintaining profitability 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and expect to be able to continue to grow through acquisitions  although we cannot predict the pace of those transactions with any certainty 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and prudent pricing in order to achieve profitability as opposed to emphasizing premium growth and achieving market share gain at any cost 
in addition to prudent risk selection and pricing  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management  and have fostered a strong culture of defending non meritorious claims 
we differentiate proassurance from many other national writers by tailoring our claims handling to the legal climate of each state 
through our market based underwriting and claims office structure  we develop a deep understanding of local market conditions  which enables us to respond to changes in the liability climate and adapt our underwriting and claims strategies as needed 
our market based focus allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers  understand the importance of the professional identity and reputation of our insureds and thus be more responsive to their needs 
we use advisory boards and operational committees to help us better understand the challenges facing our insureds and ways in which we can assist them 
we employ medical and legal professionals throughout our organization  especially on our senior management team  in order to add to our understanding of the medical legal environment 
we emphasize our pledge that each insured professional will be treated fairly in all of our conduct with them and that all of our business actions will be informed by the core values that guide our organization integrity  respect  doctor involvement in healthcare insurance activities  collaboration  communication and enthusiasm 
our strategy allows us to compete on a basis other than price alone 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices and through conservative investment practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we manage our business to protect our financial security 
we consider a number of ratios in measuring our performance  including the following the net loss ratio is calculated as net losses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is an indicator of underwriting profitability 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated as underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is an indicator of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the underwriting expense ratio and the net loss ratio and measures underwriting profitability 
the investment income ratio is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provides to our overall profitability 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio  less the investment income ratio 
this ratio incorporates the effect of investment income and underwriting profitability 

table of contents return on equity is calculated as net income for the period divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders equity 
this ratio measures our overall after tax profitability from underwriting and investment activity and shows how efficiently invested capital is being used 
we particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
our emphasis on rate adequacy  selective underwriting  effective claims management and prudent investments is a key factor in our achievement of our roe target 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
while we engage in activities that generate other income  such activities  principally fee and agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 

table of contents growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion of our existing operations 
we also look to expand through the acquisition of other specialty insurance companies or books of business  however  such expansion is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we continue to face price based competition in virtually all of our markets 
some competitors  particularly when targeting new markets  offer coverage at rates we believe to be inadequate for the risk being accepted 
a continuing competitive trend is physicians and hospitals seeking to lower their costs using alternative risk transfer approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools 
in recent years we have also seen a trend toward hospitals purchasing physician practices 
in response to these trends  we offer products designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups 
as a result of our branding campaign  treated fairly  recent acquisitions  and improvements in loss cost trends that have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets  we were able to grow our physician count in by 
we believe our emphasis on fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders has enhanced our market position and differentiated us from other insurers 
we will continue to use treated fairly in all of our activities  and we believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds 
we have been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers for a number of years  including aps 
in addition  in we expanded our insured base in new directions by acquiring a leading insurer of podiatric physicians that operates on a national basis  an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market  and an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied health care providers 
we continue to see new opportunities from each of the acquisitions and believe each will provide organic growth through expansion in their existing markets and relationships 
accounting changes investment disclosures  other than temporary impairments effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after june   the financial accounting standards board revised gaap to require expanded disclosures related to investments in debt and equity securities 
guidance regarding other than temporary impairments was also revised 
previous investment guidance required that an impairment of a debt security be considered as other than temporary unless management could assert both the intent and the ability to hold the impaired security until recovery of value 
the revised impairment guidance specifies that an impairment be considered as other than temporary unless an entity can assert that it has no intent to sell the security and that it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its anticipated amortized cost basis 
the guidance also establishes the concept of credit loss 
credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from a debt security and the amortized cost basis of the security 
the new guidance states that in instances in which a determination is made that a credit loss exists but the entity does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis an impairment is to be separated into a the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and b the amount of total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component of the impairment is to be recognized in income of the current period 
the non credit component is to be recognized as a part of other comprehensive income oci 
transition provisions require a cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify the non credit component of a previously recognized other than temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income if an entity does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we adopted the revised guidance on the date it became effective  which for pra was april  on the date of adoption our debt securities included non credit impairment losses previously recognized in earnings of approximately million 
in accordance with the transition provisions of the revised guidance  we reclassified these non credit losses  net of tax  from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income as of april   
table of contents the date of adoption a million increase to retained earnings  a million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because it has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
at december   we held cash and investments of approximately million outside of our insurance subsidiaries that are available for use without regulatory approval 
our insurance subsidiaries  in aggregate  are permitted to pay dividends of approximately million during without prior approval 
however  the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile and the regulator may prevent the dividend if  in its judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary 
in our insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of million  million of which was an approved extraordinary dividend 
acquisitions on november   we acquired of the outstanding shares of american physicians service group  inc aps  whose primary operating entity is american physicians insurance company api  in a transaction valued at million including cash paid of million and liabilities assumed of million 
aps provides professional liability insurance primarily to physicians in texas and reported gross written premium of million for the year ended december   million of which is included in proassurance consolidated premium for on april  we acquired podiatry insurance company of america and subsidiaries pica through a cash sponsored demutualization as a means of expanding our professional liability insurance operations 
pica provides professional liability insurance primarily to podiatric physicians  chiropractors and other healthcare providers throughout the united states 
we purchased all of pica s outstanding stock created in the demutualization for million in cash  of which million was a surplus contribution to be used to provide renewal premium credits to eligible policyholders over a three year period beginning in paco assurance company  inc paco  formerly wholly owned by pica  is now wholly owned by a proassurance holding company 
for simplicity of presentation  our discussions that follow combine paco and pica results for both and the combined results are referred to as pica 
in the first quarter of we acquired of the outstanding shares of mid continent general agency  inc  now proassurance mid continent underwriters  inc  mid continent  and georgia lawyers insurance company georgia lawyers  since merged with our subsidiary proassurance casualty company  as a means of expanding our professional liability business 
these acquisitions were not material to proassurance individually or in the aggregate 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the and acquisitions  including a summarized listing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
cash flows the principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of net investment income and premiums collected over losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise  timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries 

table of contents our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating cash flows for and compare as follows in millions cash flow increase decrease cash provided by operating activities year ended december  increase decrease in operating cash flows during decrease in premium receipts decrease in payments to reinsurers decrease in losses paid decrease in reinsurance recoveries increase due to prior year chw payment increase in federal and state income tax payments other amounts not individually significant  net cash provided by operating activities year ended december  the decrease in premium receipts reflects the decline in gross written premium  exclusive of the premium decline that is attributable to policies written on a two year term 
the two year term affects premiums written but has no effect on the timing of premium receipts 
additionally  approximately million of the decrease in premium receipts is due to premium credits granted to pica policyholders as part of the acquisition 
reinsurance contracts are generally for premiums written in a specific annual period  but can remain in effect until all claims under the contract have been resolved 
some contracts require annual settlements while others require settlement only after a number of years have elapsed  thus the amounts paid can vary widely from period to period 
the decrease in losses reflects lower paid losses at our subsidiaries other than pica of approximately million offset by an increase in pica losses paid of million 
the pica increase is principally due to an additional three months of pica activity in the timing of our loss payments varies from period to period because the process for resolving claims is complex and occurs at an uneven pace depending upon the circumstances of the individual claim 
the timing of reinsurance recoveries varies from period to period and can depend upon the terms of the applicable reinsurance agreement  the nature of the underlying claim and the timing and amount of underlying loss payments 
in we paid a judgment in favor of columbia hospital for women medical center  inc chw the chw judgment that was entered against our subsidiary  proassurance national capital insurance company pra national  prior to our acquisition of pra national 
we established a liability related to the judgment and accrued post trial interest at the time pra national was acquired in the increase in tax payments primarily reflects a final estimated payment for the tax year paid in that was lower than the final estimated tax payment for the tax year paid in

estimated payments for the tax year that are higher than those paid for the tax year 
our tax liability was significantly reduced by tax deductions  primarily the chw judgment and losses on the sale of impaired securities  that did not reduce gaap income

we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments  including interest payments  dividends and principal payments  as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
in addition to the interest and dividends we will receive we anticipate that between million and million of our investments will mature or be paid down each quarter of the next year and become available  if needed  to meet our cash flow requirements 
the primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through the federal home loan banking system 
however  given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee any such shortfall 
our investment portfolio continues to be primarily composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately of our fixed maturities being investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short term securities is years 
we decreased our state and municipal bond holdings by approximately million in to reduce our exposure to municipal bonds  particularly for those rated below aa 
excluding the impact of guarantees by insurers  our state and municipal bond holdings have a weighted average credit rating of aa at december  we reduced our boli investment in by redeeming approximately million of its cash surrender value 
this redemption triggered an additional tax liability of approximately million  which we recognized during we invested million in tax credit limited partnerships during million of which is committed but unfunded at december  
these partnerships are designed to provide returns via the transfer of tax operating losses and tax credits to their partners 
all of the interests are accounted for using the equity method 
we plan to increase our investment in tax credit partnerships in by up to an additional million subject to identifying opportunities that meet our investment criteria 
losses the following table  known as the analysis of reserve development  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
as noted in the table  proassurance has completed various acquisitions over the ten year period  which have affected original and re estimated gross and net reserve balances as well as loss payments 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 

table of contents the following may be helpful in understanding the analysis of reserve development the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as reported in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed in critical accounting estimates 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following the medical professional liability legal environment deteriorated in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as time has progressed  the reserves initially established for those years have continued to develop unfavorably 
we addressed the adverse severity trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
the expectation of increased claim severity was also considered in establishing our initial reserves for subsequent years 
these adverse severity trends then began to moderate 
as a result  we recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves primarily for accident years through because we have reduced our estimates of claims severity related to those years 
based on recent internal and industry claims data  we believe claims severity ie  the average size of a claim is increasing at a rate slower than we estimated when our reserves for those years were established 
a general decline in claim frequency has also been a contributor to favorable loss development 
a significant portion of our policies through were issued on an occurrence basis  and a smaller portion of our ongoing business results in occurrence like exposure due to the issuance of extended reporting endorsements 
as claim frequency declined  the number of reported claims related to these coverages were less than originally expected 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below in thousands year ended december balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 

table of contents reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  the professional liability per claim retention level has varied between and of the first million and between and of claims exceeding those levels depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
we also insure some large professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties 
these risks are reinsured on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our primary reinsurance agreement is negotiated annually at october there was no significant change in the cost or structure of the agreements renewed on october  our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer  however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our claim for reimbursement from them 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be significant to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity

we believe that our operating cash flow and funds maturing from our investment portfolio are adequate to meet our contractual obligations 
for the purposes of this table  all long term debt is assumed to be settled at its contractual maturity and interest on variable rate long term debt is calculated using interest rates in effect at december  the anticipated payout of loss and loss adjustment expenses is based upon our historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payments indicated 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for the rental of office space and office equipment 
each of our debt instruments allows for repayment before maturity  at our option  on or after certain dates 
for more information on our debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
treasury stock we repurchased approximately million common shares having a total cost of million during the year ended december  our board of directors authorized an additional million in november for the repurchase of common shares or the retirement of outstanding debt 
at december  approximately million in amounts authorized by the board remains available for use 
litigation we are involved in various legal actions related to our insurance activities which we consider in our evaluation of our reserve for losses 
we also have other direct actions against the company which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities 
in accordance with gaap for insurance entities  claim related actions are considered as a part of our loss reserving process 
we evaluate the likely outcomes from these actions giving consideration to the facts and laws applicable to each case  appellate issues  coverage issues  potential recoveries from our insurance and reinsurance programs  and settlement discussions as well as our historical claims resolution practices 
this data is then considered in the overall evaluation of our reserve for losses 
there are risks  as outlined in our risk factors in part  that any of these actions could cost us more than our estimates 
in particular  we or our insureds may receive adverse verdicts  post trial motions may result in unfavorable rulings  any appeals that may be undertaken may be unsuccessful  we may be unsuccessful in our legal efforts to limit the scope of coverage available to insureds  and we may become a party to bad faith litigation over the resolution of a claim 
for non claim related actions  we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on gaap guidance related to contingent liabilities 
to the extent that the cost of resolving these actions exceeds our estimates  the legal actions could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which any such action is resolved 

table of contents overview of results years ended december  and net income is million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  net income per diluted share is and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results from the years ended december  and compare as follows premiums net premiums earned increased during by approximately million or 
three additional months of pica earned premium and one month of aps earned premium generated approximately million of additional net earned premium 
net earned premium was increased by an additional million related to the re estimation of amounts due to reinsurers related to prior accident years 
these increases were partially offset by other declines in earned premium principally due to non renewals and rate reductions 
net investment income  net realized investment gains losses our net investment result which includes both net investment income and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased by million or primarily due to a decrease in earnings from fixed income securities and short term investments 
the decrease primarily reflects lower yields in net realized investment gains increased by million during as compared to  increased gains from sales more than offset a million increase in impairment losses 
expenses net losses decreased by million or during due to increased favorable loss development of million offset by a million increase in current accident year losses 
the increase in current accident year losses is primarily attributable to three additional months of pica activity in and one additional month of aps activity 
underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses increased in by million or 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions of pica and aps and the remainder relates to various operating factors 

table of contents ratios our net loss ratio decreased in by points 
higher favorable development decreased the ratio by points 
our underwriting expense ratio increased in by points 
the increase is attributable both to the acquisitions of pica and aps and increased policy acquisition and operating costs 
our operating ratio increased in by point reflecting a decline in the investment ratio of approximately points partially offset by the combined point decrease in the net loss and expense ratios 
return on equity is for and for book value per share our book value per share at december  is compared to at december  the change reflects our income  the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and a benefit from treasury share purchases 
due to the size of our shareholders equity approximately billion at december   the growth rate of our book value per share may slow 
the past growth rates of our book value per share do not necessarily predict similar future results 
non gaap financial measures operating income is a non gaap financial measure that is widely used to evaluate the performance of insurance entities 
operating income excludes the after tax effects of realized gains or losses  guaranty fund assessments and debt retirement loss 
we believe operating income presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations  but should be considered in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of net income to operating income in thousands  except per share data year ended december net income items excluded in the calculation of operating income loss on the extinguishment of debt net realized investment gains losses guaranty fund assessments recoupments pre tax effect of exclusions tax effect  at operating income per diluted common share net income effect of exclusions operating income per diluted common share

as required by gaap  our results include acquired entities only for the portion of the reporting period that is after the acquisition date 
our operating results include twelve months of pica activity and one month of aps activity 
our operating results include nine months of pica activity but do not include any aps results 
in many of the supporting tables that follow  the effect of the additional pica aps activity is shown separately with the column header additional pica aps activity 

table of contents premiums gross premiums written changes in our premium volume are driven by three primary factors our retention of existing business  the amount of new business we are able to generate  including business that comes to pra as a result of acquisitions  and the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected both by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase 
the professional liability market remains competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price 
gross premiums written by component are as follows in thousands change additional pica aps total activity other physician non physician healthcare providers hospital and facility other non continuing tail premiums gross premiums written  total excludes tail premiums pica million aps million pica million physician premiums physician premiums continue to be our primary revenue source and comprise and of our gross premiums written in and  respectively 
approximately million of the overall decrease in physician premiums is due to changes in our renewal patterns 
we began offering policy renewals for a two year term as opposed to a one year term to our physician insureds in one selected jurisdiction during late the premium associated with both policy terms is included in written premium in the period the policy is written  which increases gross written premium in the year the policy is written but reduces gross written premium in the following year 
approximately million of the gross written premium decline during is attributable to the policies written on a two year term 
also  during  in order to more evenly distribute renewals throughout the year  we offered early renewal to a number of insureds who otherwise would have had a first quarter renewal date 
approximately million of the decrease in physician premiums is attributable to the shift in renewal dates 
excluding aps  our retention rate for our physician business for is  which is unchanged from retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
we may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation 
insureds terminate coverage because they have retired or have otherwise ceased to practice medicine 
we may also lose insureds to competitors or to self insurance mechanisms often when physicians join hospital based practice groups due to pricing or other issues 

table of contents in the aggregate  charged rates for our physician business renewed in showed no change 
in charged rates showed an average decrease 
in general  charged rates at our pica subsidiary increased in as compared to  while rates at our other insurance subsidiaries decreased 
our charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we continue to base our rates on expected losses  as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data 
we are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our shareholders 
we wrote approximately million of new physician business during non physician premiums our non physician healthcare providers are primarily dentists  chiropractors  optometrists  and allied health professionals 
the increase is primarily related to allied health coverages  but also includes additional premium of million generated by a targeted marketing campaign to optometrists 
hospital and facility premiums decreased during the decline reflects many of the same competitive pressures that are affecting our business overall 
non physician other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums  but also includes other types of general liability premiums 
the million increase in premium volume for principally relates to our legal professional liability premiums 
non continuing in the above table separately identifies premium generated by certain types of miscellaneous liability coverages which we no longer provide 
we do expect minimal premiums from these coverages in future periods 
tail premiums we separately report tail premiums because we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 

table of contents premiums earned ceded in thousands change additional pica aps total activity other premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned includes million attributable to aps  substantially all of which relates to policies written prior to our acquisition of aps 
premiums earned because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  we renew certain policies with a two year term 
tail premiums are generally earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
the acquisition of aps is expected to increase earned premium by million related to aps premiums written prior to the acquisition that were unearned at december  the premiums will be earned in on a pro rata basis  and are expected to affect premiums earned as follows q million  q million  q million  q million 
premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 
premiums ceded declined in both and million and million  respectively due to reductions in the estimated amounts expected to be due to reinsurers related to prior year coverages 
these reductions had a significant effect on our reinsurance expense ratio as shown in the following table 

table of contents year ended december change reinsurance expense ratio before changes to prior accident years effect of estimate changes to prior accident years reinsurance expense ratio  calendar year excluding the effect of the changes to prior year estimates  the decrease in the reinsurance expense is primarily due to shifts in the mix of our business during as compared to in we discontinued offering certain non physician liability policies see discussion under premiums  and reduced our reinsurance coverage related to the policies 
also  premiums earned from our legal professional liability business acquired from georgia lawyers were more heavily reinsured in than in pre acquisition reinsurance agreements were in effect in but proassurance reinsurance agreements with higher retention limits were in effect in net investment income  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries  net realized investment gains losses net investment income net investment income is primarily derived from the income earned on our fixed maturity securities and also includes dividend income from equity securities  income from our short term  cash equivalent investments  earnings from other investments and increases in the cash surrender value of business owned life insurance contracts 
investment fees and expenses are deducted from investment income 
net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december change fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income fixed maturities 
the decrease in income in reflects lower yields  partially offset by higher average investment balances 
the overall yield on our portfolio declined because we were not able to reinvest proceeds from maturities  pay downs and sales at rates comparable to expiring rates while maintaining our asset quality and the duration of our portfolio 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield the level of our investment in fixed maturity securities varies depending upon a number of factors  including  among others  our operating cash needs  anticipated shifts in credit markets  the attractiveness of other investment alternatives  and cash needed for acquisitions or other capital purposes 
in as compared to  our average investment in fixed maturities increased by approximately short term investments 
the decrease in earnings for reflects a decline in short term interest rates and lower average invested balances 

table of contents equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries is derived from our investment interests accounted for under the equity method  as follows in thousands year ended december change private investment funds  currently held private investment fund  liquidated in other business interests tax credit partnerships equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries we hold interests in certain private investment funds that derive earnings from trading portfolios 
the performance of these funds is affected by the volatility of equity and credit markets 
one fund  shown separately in the table  was liquidated in july we have acquired an interest in a development stage limited liability company that will  in time  engage in active business operations 
while we expect this investment to provide a positive return over time  we anticipate operating losses during the start up phase  expected to last another twelve months 
our potential for loss is limited to the carrying amount of our investment  currently million 
we began investing in tax credit limited partnerships in our tax credit investments are designed to generate investment returns by providing tax benefits to fund investors in the form of net operating losses and tax credits 
during our tax credit partnerships generated a tax benefit of approximately million 
tax equivalent investment result we believe that to fully understand our investment returns it is important to consider the tax benefits associated with certain investments  therefore  we impute a tax equivalent investment result in order to better reflect the economies of our decision to invest in certain asset classes that are either taxed at lower rates and or result in reductions to our federal income tax expense 
year ended december investment results  as reported net investment income equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries taxable equivalent adjustments for state and municipal bonds boli tax credit partnerships tax equivalent investment results all adjustments were calculated using the federal statutory tax rate tax credits provided approximated million in no credits were provided in 
table of contents net realized investment gains losses the following table provides detailed information regarding our net realized investment gains losses 
in thousands year ended december total other than temporary impairment losses residential mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equities equity interest in a private investment fund high yield asset backed securities  see discussion below portion recognized in reclassified from other comprehensive income residential mortgage backed securities net impairment losses recognized in earnings net gains losses from sales trading portfolio gains fair value adjustments  net net realized investment gains losses in accordance with gaap  all otti losses prior to april  were recognized in earnings 
we have recognized impairments of million during related to certain high yield asset backed securities 
the securities were returned to our direct ownership in when our interest in a private investment fund was liquidated 
based on our intent to sell the securities  we have recognized all declines in fair value below our cost basis as other than temporary impairments 
we recognized an impairment of million in related to an interest in a private investment fund which we account for on a cost basis 
the fund has reported realized losses on the sale of securities  and we have reduced the carrying value of our interest in the fund in recognition of our pro rata share of those losses 
we recognized impairments in earnings of million in  including million reclassified from oci  related to residential mortgage backed securities 
expected future cash flows were less than our carrying value for these securities  therefore  we reduced the carrying value of our interest in these securities and recognized the loss in our net income 
fair value adjustments are attributable to our election of fair value treatment for both the note payable and related interest rate swap  as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for claims made policies  which represent over of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer  for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 

table of contents the following tables summarize calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses year ended december net loss ratios total change year ended december change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
the increase in current accident year losses for is primarily attributable to three additional months of pica activity and one month of aps activity 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized favorable loss development of million and million respectively  on a net basis  related to reserves established in prior years 
the principal components of development are as follows in millions year ended december reserve development by accident year  favorable unfavorable accident years accident years accident years accident years prior to net favorable development recognized substantially all of the favorable development recognized during and relates to medical professional liability claims made reserves 
the favorable development for medical professional claims made policies in both years is based upon observation of actual claims data that indicates that claims severity ie  the expected average cost of claims is trending below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of final claim settlement values  we are generally cautious in giving credence to the trends that lead to the recognition of favorable net loss development 
as we conclude that sufficient credible data with respect to these trends exists we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining attentive to the past volatility of claims severity 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made  as has been the case in and 
table of contents underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses the table below provides a comparison of our and underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses in thousands change related to pica aps total transactions other insurance operation expenses  total agency related expenses expense increase related to pica aps excluding agency related expenses approximately million of the increase in underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses are attributable to the pica and aps transactions  as detailed below in thousands one month of aps activity in three additional months of pica activity in aps transaction and closing costs expensed in pica transaction and closing costs expensed in increased pica policy acquisition costs in in we incurred million in transaction related costs associated with the purchase of pica  principally for severance costs and investment banking fees 
similarly  we incurred million in transaction related costs primarily in the third and fourth quarters of associated with the purchase of aps 
the increase in policy acquisition expenses reflects the application of gaap purchase accounting rules whereby the capitalized policy acquisition costs for policies written prior to the acquisition date are written off rather than being expensed ratably over the term of the associated insurance policy 
application of this guidance resulted in lower than normal pica acquisition costs in similarly  aps acquisition expenses for the one month included in our results for are lower than what would be considered normal and will increase gradually in as more aps earned premium is generated by policies written after the acquisition date 

table of contents other expense increase the remaining million increase in insurance operation expenses is primarily due to the following expense for policy acquisition costs was higher in primarily because premium earned related to allied healthcare  legal and miscellaneous professional liability coverages increased in commission and underwriting expenses associated with these premiums are higher than those associated with physician premiums 
we recognized million in ceding commission expense related to a captive insurance arrangement that was terminated in we allocate our operating costs between insurance operations expense and loss adjustment expenses 
the amount allocated to loss adjustment expense decreased by million in  which had the effect of increasing operating expenses 
guaranty fund assessments or recoupments are not controlled by us  but do affect our results 
in both and recoupments exceeded assessments  but the recoupment benefit was million greater in we terminated and replaced our employee stock ownership plan during the year  resulting in an acceleration of vesting of participants accounts 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million during the year 
the new plan put in place provides for vesting of benefits over a three year period and will result in lower operating expenses  as compared to the prior plan over the next three years 
we entered into a deferred compensation agreement with one of our senior executives resulting in the recognition of a million expense during the fourth quarter 
agency related expenses we operate several fee based agencies and provide benefit management services on a limited basis 
their business activities generate commission and service fee revenues which are reported as a part of other income 
we have excluded the direct expenses of these entities from our underwriting expense ratio computations because their activities and business operations are not associated with the generation of premium revenues 
during the latter part of we discontinued certain agency activities which reduced expenses as compared to underwriting expense ratio underwriting expense ratio year ended december change insurance operation expenses our expense ratio computations exclude agency related expenses as discussed above

table of contents pra exclusive of pica changes in our premium volume are driven by three primary factors our retention of existing business  the amount of new business we are able to generate including business that comes to pra as a result of acquisitions  and the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected both by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase 
the professional liability market continues to remain competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price 
physician premiums continue to be our primary revenue source and comprise and of our gross premiums written in and  respectively 
our physician retention rate is and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
insureds may terminate coverage because they are leaving the practice of medicine through death  disability or retirement 
also  based on our underwriting evaluation  we may choose not to renew an insured 
we may lose business to competitors or to self insurance mechanisms often when physicians join hospital based practice groups due to pricing or other issues 
new business increased during we wrote approximately million of new physician business during the year that was not attributable to acquisitions  as compared to million in in the third and fourth quarters of  we began renewing physician policies for a two year term in a selected jurisdiction 
written premium for the entire two year policy term is recorded in the period the policy is renewed  while earned premium is recorded on a pro rata basis over the two year policy term 
the gross written premiums attributable to two year policies for is million as compared to million written in also  in  in order to more evenly distribute renewals throughout the year  we offered early renewal to a number of insureds who would otherwise have had a first quarter renewal date 
as a result of the shift in renewal dates  in there will be approximately million less in business eligible to be renewed 
as favorable loss trends have emerged we have lowered our rates where indicated 
for our physician business  our charged rates on renewals decreased on average  as compared to an average decrease of for our charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we remain committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our stockholders 
our non physician healthcare providers are primarily dentists and allied health professionals 
the increase in this business is primarily attributable to business contributed by mid continent 
non physician other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums  but also includes other types of general liability premiums 
the acquisitions of georgia lawyers and mid continent contributed additional non physician premiums of approximately million in we separately report tail premiums because we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
pica gross premiums written contributed by pica consist primarily of coverages provided to podiatrists  who are categorized as physician premiums in the above table  and coverages provided to chiropractors  who are categorized as non physician health care providers in the above table 
our retention rate for the core pica business is approximately 

table of contents premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned pra all other pica acquisition   nm because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  beginning in late we began to renew some policies with a two year term 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
pra exclusive of pica exclusive of the effect of tail premiums and acquisitions  the decline in premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to reflects declines in gross premiums written during and pica pica subsidiaries contributed earned premiums of approximately million during  approximately million of which relates to premiums written prior to the date of acquisition and thus never reported in our written premiums 
at december  approximately million of premium written prior to the acquisition is yet to be earned and will be added to our earned premium on a pro rata basis  principally during the first quarter of premiums ceded in thousands year ended december change premiums ceded pra all other pica acquisition   nm points reinsurance expense ratio pra all other pica acquisition nm consolidated calculated as premiums ceded as a percentage of premiums earned premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 

table of contents pra exclusive of pica premiums ceded in both and include amounts related to changes to our estimates of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years  as follows 
in thousands premiums ceded reinsurance expense ratio year ended december year ended december premiums ceded  before estimate changes estimate changes  prior accident years premiums ceded the increase in our reinsurance expense ratio for is due to an increase in premiums ceded  along with a decrease in premiums earned  which reflects shifts in the mix of our premiums 
the increase in premiums ceded is principally related to legal professional liability premiums  which are generally more heavily reinsured than our physician premiums 
the decline in premiums earned is principally attributable to physician policies with lower coverage limits for which we retain all of the risk of loss  consequently  there is no corresponding decrease to premiums ceded 
the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years is largely determined based on the losses expected to be recovered  subject to certain minimums and maximums specific to the reinsurance agreement being adjusted 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses within our reinsured layers of coverage  as well as the related reinsurance recoveries and premiums ceded 
however  the reductions were more pronounced in pica the pica subsidiaries cede only a small portion of the risk on the policies they issue 
accordingly  the reinsurance expense ratio for these entities is minimal 
net investment income  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries  net realized investment gains losses net investment income consolidated in thousands year ended december change net investment income net investment income is primarily derived from the income earned by our fixed maturity securities and also includes income from our short term  cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  earnings from other investments and increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts

net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income 
table of contents fixed maturities 
the increase in income in reflects higher average invested balances  the benefit of which was offset almost entirely by lower yields 
the increase in average invested balances is principally attributable to the pica acquisition 
yields declined in as a result of proceeds from maturities and sales being reinvested at lower rates 
lower returns from tips treasury inflation protected securities also reduced yields in we expect average yields to continue to decrease in  unless market rates improve 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield short term investments 
the decrease in earnings from short term investments during reflects a decline in market interest rates an average of basis points for the year on lower average balances in as compared to in the latter portion of  we increased our short term holdings because of the instability in the longer term market and to also provide funds needed for the pica acquisition 
as markets stabilized in  we reduced our short term holdings 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries consolidated in thousands year ended december change equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries is derived from our investment interests in three private funds accounted for under the equity method 
the funds primarily hold trading portfolios  and changes in the fair value of securities held by the fund are included in current earnings of the fund 
the performance of all three funds is affected by the volatility of equity and credit markets 
no unconsolidated subsidiaries were acquired in the pica acquisition 
net realized investment gains losses consolidated the following table provides detailed information regarding our net realized investment gains losses 
in thousands year ended december total other than temporary impairment losses residential mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equities other portion recognized in other comprehensive income residential mortgage backed securities net impairment losses recognized in earnings net gains losses from sales trading portfolio gains losses fair value adjustments  net net realized investment gains losses includes unrealized impairment losses of approximately  that were recognized in earnings in the first quarter of but reclassified from retained earnings to other comprehensive income on april  includes million related to lehman for includes million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock for includes million related to the reserve primary fund in accordance with gaap all otti losses prior to april  were recognized in earnings 
table of contents trading portfolio gains are primarily attributable to improved market prices for equity securities during fair value adjustments are attributable to our election of fair value treatment for both the note payable and related interest rate swap  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies  which represent the majority of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
all losses associated with the subsidiaries we acquired from pica are considered current accident year losses because the insured event became a proassurance liability in the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and  respectively  by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december change change current accident year pra all other pica acquisition consolidated prior accident years pra all other pica acquisition consolidated calendar year pra all other pica acquisition consolidated net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
pra exclusive of pica the current accident year loss ratio increased points when compared to the prior year  approximately of this increase is attributable to an increase to our reserve for the death  disability and retirement ddr provision in our claims made polices 
after a number of coverage years  most of our insureds qualify for this extended coverage when the insured retires or should the insured die or become disabled during the policy term 
our strong retention rate has resulted in an increase in the number of insureds expected to become eligible to receive this extended coverage and we have recorded a corresponding increase to the related reserve 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we recognized favorable loss development of million and million  on a net basis  related to reserves established in prior years 
the principal components of development are as follows in millions year ended december reserve development by accident year  favorable unfavorable accident years accident years accident years accident years prior to net favorable development recognized substantially all of the development recognized during and relates to medical professional liability claims made reserves 
the favorable development for medical professional claims made policies in both and is based upon observation of actual claims data which indicates that claims severity ie  the expected average cost of claims is trending below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of final claim settlement values  we are generally cautious in giving credence to the trends that lead to the recognition of favorable net loss development 
as we conclude that sufficient credible data with respect to these trends exists we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining attentive to the past volatility of claims severity 
in establishing the rates for our insurance products we consider loss and loss trends over a multi year period 
to the extent that we experience improvements in claims frequency and claims severity these improvements are considered in our rate making process and reflected in our established rates 
we have reflected decreased estimates of severity in our rate making process as well as in our loss estimates for several years 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
pica the current accident year loss ratio was adversely affected by an increase to reserves for the ddr provision associated with pica claims made policies and by unfavorable development of losses associated with certain other liability coverages 
when the effect of these two items is excluded  pica net loss ratio is approximately 
in  we plan to discontinue offering the other liability coverage that generated the unfavorable development

pica transaction expenses of  were paid by proassurance during insurance operation expenses exclusive of pica expenses during reflect a number of cost variations  but changed little on a net basis 
expenses for commissions  brokerage fees  and underwriting and sales salaries and benefits were higher in  both because we earned more non physician premiums which carry higher expenses than physician premiums and because more of our physician premium was generated by external commissioned agents 
also  guaranty fund recoupments are lower in than in partially offsetting these higher costs is a million reduction in share based compensation costs  due to a different type of award made in costs were also reduced in by a million benefit related to final settlement of the chw judgment actual costs incurred were less than amounts previously estimated 
other expense information agency related expenses 
we operate several insurance agencies and provide benefit management services on a limited basis through a separate pica subsidiary 
these activities generate commission and service fee revenues  which are reported as a part of other income 
the acquisition of mid continent and pica increased these expenses in we have excluded the direct expenses of these activities from our underwriting expense ratio computations because the activities are not associated with the generation of premium revenues 
guaranty fund assessments 
insurance operation expenses in the table above are reduced by net recoupments from guaranty fund assessments of approximately million and million during and  respectively 
underwriting expense ratio exclusive of pica the point increase in our underwriting expense ratio is primarily a result of a decline in net premiums earned in as compared to  while expenses remained relatively flat

almost of pica earned premium relates to policies written prior to the acquisition 
in accordance with the gaap guidance for business combinations  we did not recognize any acquisition expense for these policies 
however  in  almost all of our pica earned premium will relate to policies written after the acquisition 
on average  in we would expect the pica expense ratio to approximate interest expense consolidated interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily because we reduced outstanding debt in the latter half of we converted all our convertible debentures in july of aggregate principal of million and extinguished approximately million of our trust preferred securities debentures tps debentures in mid december also  rates on our variable rate debt decreased by approximately basis points in as compared to these reductions in interest expense were partially offset by additional interest expense incurred in the latter half of related to debt and other liabilities assumed in the pica acquisition see notes and

the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate tax exempt income had a less significant effect on our effective tax rate primarily because taxable income increased at a greater rate than tax exempt income 
our taxable income reflected impairment losses of million  whereas taxable income reflected impairment losses of million 
also  we recognized more a million increase favorable loss development in than in which also increased taxable income 
we expect to be able to realize the full benefit of deferred tax assets associated with impairment losses because capital gains recognized during the statutory carryback period are sufficient to absorb the impairment losses 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million has been established related to pica capital loss carry forwards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell any of the debt securities held in an unrealized loss position before its anticipated recovery 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates by asset class at december  there are principally two factors that determine interest rates on a given security market interest rates and credit spreads 
as different asset classes can be affected in different ways by movements in those two factors  we have broken out our portfolio by asset class in the following table 
december  interest rate shift in basis points current fair value in millions us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities december  fair value in millions us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities 
table of contents interest rate risk continued computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  is on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and due to the amounts due from our reinsurers 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase and by monitoring the credit standing of our reinsurers 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  such as am best  fitch  moody s  and standard poor s 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  investment grade securities  in spite of their rating  can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
ratings published by the nrsros are one of the tools used to evaluate the credit worthiness of our securities 
the ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the credit worthiness of the securities  and therefore  we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the rating prove to be unreliable 
we hold billion of municipal bonds 
these bonds may have enhanced credit ratings as a result of guarantees by an insurer  but we require the bonds that we purchase to meet our credit criteria on a stand alone basis 
as of december   on a stand alone basis  our municipal bonds have a weighted average rating of aa 
our receivable from reinsurers on paid and unpaid losses at december  is million 
a detail listing of individual reinsurance balances of greater than million and the current credit rating of that reinsurer is provided in capital and liquidity under the sub header reinsurance 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities is 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
