item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade handheld test and measurement instruments and accredited provider of calibration  repair and other measurement services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are product and service 
in our product segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement instruments 
additionally  because we specialize in handheld test and measurement instruments  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to aid them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
sales in our product segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as customers increase or decrease capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables  but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
our strength in our service segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our service segment offers an opportunity for long term growth and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers with regular calibration cycles 
we evaluate revenue growth in both of our business segments against a trailing twelve month trend  and not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
in evaluating our results for fiscal year  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year operating results include a full year of operations from united scale  whereas  fiscal year operating results included those of united scale from the date of acquisition on january  fiscal year operating results include those of tmetrix and wtt  which were acquired on november  and january   respectively

see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our major catalogs and intangible assets  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to revenues over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of revenues and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 

table of contents property and equipment  depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements buildings property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in the procurement and development of computer software used for internal purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount and that no impairment was indicated as of march  and march  other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
no impairment indicators were present as of march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were million as of march  and march  deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
if necessary  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized based on an assessment of both positive and negative evidence 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards by recognizing  on a straight line basis  the unamortized grant date fair value over the remaining service period of each award 
excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock awards are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not capitalize any stock based compensation costs as part of an asset 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience 
options generally vest over a period of up to four years  using either a graded schedule or on a straight line basis  and expire ten years from the date of grant 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  options granted to executive officers vest using a graded schedule of in the first year  in each of the second and third years  and in the fourth year 
prior options granted to executive officers vested equally over three years 
the expense relating to these executive officer options is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal years  and  we granted performance based restricted stock awards in place of options as a primary component of executive compensation 
the performance based restricted stock awards vest after three years subject to certain cumulative diluted earnings per share growth targets over the eligible three year period 
during the second quarter of fiscal year and in conjunction with the acquisition of westcon  we modified these target levels by increasing the cumulative diluted earnings per share growth performance condition 
the modification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost ultimately recognized for these performance based restricted stock awards will equal the grant date fair market value of the award that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance conditions 
on an interim basis  we record compensation cost based on an assessment of the probability of achieving the performance conditions 
at march   we estimated the probability of achievement for the performance based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal years and to be and of the target levels  respectively 
the performance based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year did not vest on march  as the performance condition related to these awards was not achieved 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
product sales are recorded when a product s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or other activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
we generally invoice our customers for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded based upon historical data 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
reclassification of amounts 
certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal years have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal year 
in addition  certain reclassifications of financial information for prior fiscal quarters have been made to conform to the presentation for the current fiscal quarters

within the industries we operate and excluding united scale  both direct and reseller channel sales growth rates were between and 
we attribute this increase to a better economy and resulting improved pricing environment as well as continued direct marketing campaigns 
during the same period  sales to wind energy customers declined million  or  in what was widely considered a weak year in the wind energy industry 
the following table presents the percent of net sales for our significant product distribution channels for each quarter during fiscal years and fy fy q q q q q q q q percent of net sales direct reseller freight billed to customer customer product orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory  customized products  and other products ordered less frequently  which we do not stock 
pending product shipments are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our laboratories prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete or at a future date  and other orders awaiting final credit or management review prior to shipment 
year over year increases in each of the aforementioned classifications contributed to an approximately million  or  increase in our pending product shipments balance at the end of fiscal year compared to the balance at the end of fiscal year variations in pending product shipments can be impacted by several factors  including the timing product orders are placed in relation to the end of the fiscal period  specialized product orders that are not stocked  or production issues experienced by manufacturers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total pending product shipments that were backorders at the end of each quarter in fiscal years and and our historical trend of total pending product shipments fy fy q q q q q q q q total pending product shipments of pending product shipments that are backorders calibration services net revenue  which accounted for of our total net revenue in fiscal years and  increased from fiscal year to fiscal year because the timing of calibration orders and segment expenses can vary on a quarter to quarter basis  we believe a trailing twelve month trend provides a better indication of the progress of this segment 
the growth in fiscal year is the result of increased revenue from non wind energy customers  including expansion of our traditional service customer base as well as million of incremental revenue from united scale 
services provided to wind energy customers during 
table of contents fiscal year was consistent with those provided in the prior fiscal year and represented of total service revenue 
also  within any year  while we add new customers  we also have customers from the prior year whose calibrations may not repeat for any number of factors 
among those factors are the variations in the timing of customer periodic calibrations on instruments and other services  customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions 
our fiscal years and calibration service revenue in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons  were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q service revenue growth within the calibration industry  there is a broad array of measurement disciplines making it costly and inefficient for any one provider to invest the needed capital for facilities  equipment and uniquely trained personnel necessary to address all measurement disciplines with in house calibration capabilities 
our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical  temperature  pressure and dimensional disciplines 
accordingly  over the long term  we expect to outsource to of service segment revenue to third party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities 
during any individual quarter  we could fluctuate beyond these percentages 
during fiscal year  we outsourced of our total service revenue 
we will continue to evaluate the need for capital investments that could provide more in house capabilities for our staff of technicians and reduce the need for third party vendors in certain instances

we evaluate product gross profit from two perspectives 
channel gross profit includes net sales less the direct cost of inventory sold 
our total product gross profit includes channel gross profit as well as the impact of vendor rebates  cooperative advertising income  freight billed to customers  freight expenses and direct shipping costs 
in general  our total product gross profit can vary based upon price discounting  the mix of sales to our reseller channel  which have lower margins than our direct customer base  and the timing of periodic vendor rebates and cooperative advertising income received from suppliers 
total product gross profit in fiscal year was of total product sales and increased basis points when compared with of total product sales in fiscal year product gross profit increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily the result of higher sales as well as a 
table of contents combined million in incremental vendor rebates and cooperative advertising income 
the gross profit percentage in our direct and reseller channels increased basis points and basis points  respectively  from fiscal year to fiscal year gross margins were generally better in fiscal year due in part to an improved economy

our fiscal years and product sales in relation to prior fiscal year quarter comparisons were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales growth decline product net sales per day declined in both the first and second quarters of fiscal year when compared against the same quarter in the prior fiscal year  a direct result of the economy 
as the economy began to improve in the second half of fiscal year  we experienced growth in daily sales volume for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year when compared against the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year our product sales per business day for each quarter during fiscal years and were as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day the increase in product net sales was primarily due to increased sales in the wind energy industry 
during fiscal year  product sales to the wind energy industry were million  or of net product sales 
the sales growth achieved in the wind energy industry was partially offset by a decline in sales to non wind energy customers within our direct channel as a result of the economic climate experienced during fiscal year as economic conditions improved in the latter part of fiscal year  the second half year over year sales growth did not fully offset the sales decline from the first half 
during the first half of fiscal  non wind sales to our direct channel declined  when compared to the first half of fiscal year during the second half of fiscal year  non wind sales to our direct channel increased  when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year

our total pending product shipments at the end of fiscal year increased by approximately million  or  from the balance at the end of fiscal year the increase in pending product shipments was primarily attributable to increased backorders  which included million in incremental pending product shipments associated with united scale  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the economy improved and customer demand in the marketplace quickly increased  manufacturers were slower to respond  thus resulting in longer lead times for many of the products we sell

liquidity and capital resources we believe that amounts available under our credit agreement  which was extended for three years on january  with substantially similar terms  and our cash on hand are sufficient to satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure needs as well as our lease commitments for the foreseeable future 

table of contents cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year significant working capital fluctuations were as follows inventory accounts payable inventory balance at march  was million  an increase of million when compared to million on hand at march  the increase was partly due to a strategic decision to maintain higher inventory levels of specific  higher volume products  in support of greater sales growth and in an effort to reduce future backorder issues similar to those experienced at times during fiscal year in general  our accounts payable balance increases or decreases as a result of timing of vendor payments for inventory receipts 
however  this correlation may vary at a quarter end due to the timing of vendor payments for inventory receipts and inventory shipped directly to customers  as well as the timing of product sales 
in fiscal year  inventory increased and payables decreased primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases 
inventory was purchased near the end of fiscal year which was paid for in fiscal year receivables we continue to generate positive operating cash flows and maintain strong collections on our accounts receivable 
the following table illustrates our days sales outstanding from fiscal year to fiscal year march  march  net sales  for the last two fiscal months accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding investing activities in fiscal year  we used million of cash in investing activities  million for business acquisitions and million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for additional service capabilities and infrastructure improvements that included facility expansion and investment in information technology 
in fiscal year  we used million of cash in investing activities 
the primary uses of the cash were million for the acquisition of united scale  million in contingent consideration relating to our acquisition of westcon and million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for purposes similar to those in fiscal year financing activities financing activities provided million in cash during fiscal year  of which million was from net borrowings from our revolving line of credit  primarily for business acquisitions and the repurchase of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
in addition  we received million of cash in fiscal year from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during fiscal year  we used million in cash for financing activities  including million to reduce our debt 
in addition  we used million of cash for the repurchase of  shares of common stock from beneficiaries of a former board member s estate at a price of per share 
this use of cash in fiscal year was offset by million of cash generated primarily from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and warrants

outlook looking ahead  we see a stable to modestly improving economic outlook in our fiscal year ending march  that should result in mid single digit product segment growth and stable gross profit ratios  exclusive of the impact of the wtt acquisition 
our service segment should grow at a greater rate than our product segment  and in combination with our service targeted acquisition strategy  expand our service and operating margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by less than million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
as of march   million was outstanding and included in long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
under our credit facility described in note of our consolidated financial statements  interest is adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio 
we mitigate our interest rate risk by electing the lower of the base rate available under the credit facility and the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin 
as of march   the base rate and the libor rate were and  respectively 
our interest rate for fiscal year ranged from to 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
foreign currency over of our net revenues for fiscal years and were denominated in us dollars  with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar would impact our net revenues by less than 
we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
we periodically enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of the contracts  which totaled less than million in each of fiscal years and was recognized as a component of other expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying receivables denominated in canadian dollars being hedged 
on march   we had a foreign exchange contract set to mature in april  outstanding in the notional amount of million 
we do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes
