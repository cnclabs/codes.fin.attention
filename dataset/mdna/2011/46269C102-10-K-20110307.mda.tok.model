item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of iridium holdings llc our predecessor entity included in this form k 
background we were formed as ghl acquisition corp  a special purpose acquisition company  on november   for the purpose of effecting a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase  reorganization or other similar business combination 
we closed an initial public offering of our common stock on february  all of our activity from november  inception through february  related to our formation and initial public offering 
from february  through september   our activities were limited to identifying prospective target businesses to acquire and completing a business combination  and we were considered to be in the development stage 
on september   we acquired  directly and indirectly  all the outstanding equity of iridium holdings llc  or iridium holdings 
we refer to this transaction as the acquisition 
iridium holdings  its subsidiary iridium satellite llc  or iridium satellite  and iridium satellite s subsidiary iridium constellation llc  or iridium constellation  were formed under the laws of delaware in and were organized as limited liability companies pursuant to the delaware limited liability company act 
we refer to iridium holdings  together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries  as iridium 
on december  
table of contents iridium acquired satellite communications assets from iridium llc  a non affiliated debtor in possession 
iridium and its affiliates held  and following the acquisition we hold  various licenses and authorizations from the us federal communications commission  or fcc  and from foreign regulatory bodies that permit us to conduct our business  including the operation of our satellite constellation 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  we purchased all of the outstanding equity of iridium holdings 
total consideration included million shares of our common stock and million in cash  including payments totaling million in cash we made in december and january to some of the former members of iridium holdings for tax benefits we received 
upon the closing of the acquisition  we changed our name from ghl acquisition corp 
to iridium communications inc we accounted for our business combination with iridium holdings as a purchase business combination and recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values 
we were deemed the legal and accounting acquirer and iridium holdings the legal and accounting acquiree 
iridium is considered our predecessor and  accordingly  its historical financial statements are deemed to be our predecessor financial statements 
iridium s historical financial statements are included in this form k but are presented separately from our financial statements 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded the assets and liabilities we acquired from iridium at fair value  which resulted in a significant increase in the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the impact of acquisition accounting on our carrying value of inventory  property and equipment  intangible assets and accruals  was an increase of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  compared to iridium s balance sheet as of september  similarly  iridium s deferred revenue decreased by million 
as a result of the effect of acquisition accounting  our cost of subscriber equipment sales increased in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of as compared to those costs and expenses of iridium in prior periods  and the decrease in the carrying value of deferred revenue caused a decrease in revenue  which we expect will continue through in addition  the increase in accruals had the effect of reducing cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization since the acquisition  which we expect will continue into future periods 
the increase in property and equipment and intangible assets had the effect of increasing depreciation and amortization expense since the acquisition  which we expect will continue into future periods 
overview of our business we are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites 
we are the second largest provider of satellite based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue  and the only commercial provider of communications services offering global coverage 
our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where existing wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are impaired  including extremely remote or rural land areas  airways  open ocean  the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters 
we provide voice and data communications services to businesses  the us and foreign governments  non governmental organizations and consumers using our constellation of in orbit satellites and related ground infrastructure  including a primary commercial gateway 
we utilize an interlinked  mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks 
this unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation  which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence 
we sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network  encompassing approximately service providers  value added resellers  or vars  and value added manufacturers  who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers  vars or dealers 
these distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific vertical markets 
at december   we had approximately  billable subscribers worldwide  an increase of  or from approximately  billable subscribers at december  we have a diverse customer base  including end users in the following vertical markets land based handset  maritime  aviation  machine to machine  or mm  and government 
we expect a higher proportion of our future revenue will be derived from services 
voice and mm data service revenue historically have generated higher gross margin than subscriber equipment revenue 
we expect our future revenue growth rates will be somewhat lower than our historical rates primarily due to decreased subscriber equipment revenue growth and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates as our revenue increases 

table of contents we are currently devoting a substantial part of our resources to develop iridium next  our next generation satellite constellation  along with the development of new product and service offerings  upgrades to our current services  hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems 
we estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related infrastructure upgrades through early to be approximately billion 
we believe our new credit facility  described below  together with internally generated cash flow  including potential revenues from hosted payloads  will be sufficient to fully fund the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related infrastructure upgrades through early for more information about our sources of funding  see liquidity and capital resources 
full scale development and launch services agreements in june  we  through iridium satellite  executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract  or fsd  with thales alenia space france  or thales  for the design and manufacture of satellites for iridium next 
the effectiveness of the fsd was contingent upon our securing financing for the fsd  which occurred on october  when we satisfied the conditions for the first borrowing under the billion loan facility  or the facility 
the total price under the fsd will be approximately billion  and we expect our payment obligations under the fsd to extend into the third quarter of as of december   we had made total payments of million to thales  which was classified within property and equipment  net  in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  in march  we  through iridium satellite  entered into an agreement with space exploration technologies corp  or spacex  to secure spacex as the primary launch services provider for iridium next 
the effectiveness of this agreement  which we refer to as the spacex agreement  was contingent upon our securing financing for the fsd  which occurred on october  the spacex agreement  as amended  has a maximum price of million 
as of december   we had made total payments of million to spacex  which was classified as property and equipment  net  in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  new credit facility on october   iridium satellite entered into the facility with a syndicate of bank lenders 
ninety five percent of the obligations under the facility are insured by compagnie fran aise d assurance pour le commerce ext rieur  or coface 
the facility consists of two tranches  with draws and repayments applied pro rata in respect of each tranche tranche a  at a fixed rate of  and tranche b  at a floating rate equal to the london interbank offer rate  or libor  plus 
in connection with each draw it makes under the facility  iridium satellite will also borrow an amount equal to of such draw to cover the premium for the coface policy 
iridium satellite will also pay a commitment fee of per year  in semi annual installments  on any undrawn portion of the facility beginning on april  in addition  pursuant to separate fee letters entered into at the same time as the facility  iridium satellite paid arrangement fees to the syndicate banks totaling million on october  funds drawn under the facility will be used for i of the costs under the fsd for the design and manufacture of iridium next and reimbursement to iridium satellite for of the amounts it previously paid to thales under the authorization to proceed  or atp  which allowed thales to commence work immediately on the development of satellites prior to the effectiveness of the fsd  ii the premium for the coface policy and iii the payment of a portion of interest during a portion of the construction and launch phase of iridium next 

table of contents scheduled semi annual principal repayments will begin six months after the earlier of i the successful deployment of a specified number of iridium next satellites or ii september  during this repayment period  interest will be paid on the same date as the principal repayments 
prior to the repayment period  interest payments will be due on a semi annual basis beginning on april  the facility will mature seven years after the start of the repayment period 
in addition  we are required to maintain minimum debt service reserve levels  which are estimated as follows at december  amount in millions these levels may be higher once we begin repayments under the facility 
there was no required minimum debt service reserve level at december  iridium satellite s obligations under the facility are guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries that are obligors under the facility and are secured on a senior basis by a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of iridium satellite and the other obligors 
iridium satellite may not prepay any borrowings prior to december  if on that date  a specified number of iridium next satellites have been successfully launched and we have adequate time and resources to complete the iridium next constellation on schedule  iridium satellite may prepay the borrowings without penalty 
in addition  following the completion of the iridium next constellation  iridium satellite may prepay the borrowings without penalty 
any amounts repaid may not be reborrowed 
iridium satellite must repay the loans in full upon i a delisting of our common stock  ii a change in control of our company or our ceasing to own of any of the other obligors or iii the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
we must apply all or a portion of specified capital raising proceeds  insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds to the prepayment of the loans 
the facility includes customary representations  events of default  covenants and conditions precedent to drawing of funds 
the financial covenants include a minimum cash requirement  a minimum debt to equity ratio level  maximum capital expenditure levels  minimum consolidated operational ebitda levels  minimum cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites  minimum debt service reserve levels  a minimum debt service coverage ratio level  and maximum leverage levels 
the covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions  dispose of assets  grant security interests  declare  make or pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  fund payments under the fsd from our own resources  incur debt  or make loans  guarantees or indemnities 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  as of december   we had borrowed million under the facility 
the unused portion of the facility as of december  was approximately billion 
we recognized the semi annual commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the facility of million  which is included in other expense income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  settlement of motorola litigation on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with motorola  inc  or motorola  pursuant to which the parties settled the litigation previously filed by motorola against iridium satellite and iridium holdings in illinois 
on the same date  the parties entered into a series of other agreements 
pursuant to these several agreements  iridium satellite agreed to pay motorola an aggregate of million to repay debt of million otherwise due in  and million in consideration of expanded intellectual property licenses  the conversion of existing intellectual property licenses from being royalty based to prepaid  the transfer to us of ownership of certain intellectual property rights  and million for the termination of motorola s rights to distributions and payments based on the value of our company upon certain triggering events and mutual releases of claims 
of the total million  we paid million contemporaneously with the execution of the settlement agreement and the remaining million is reflected in a promissory note iridium satellite issued to motorola  which bears interest at the rate of per annum and matures on december  the promissory note to motorola is secured by a security interest in iridium satellite s accounts receivable and iridium satellite s principal 
table of contents operating account  and is guaranteed by iridium holdings and by us 
as of december   we and motorola agreed that the million we had on deposit with motorola pursuant to the provisions of the amended and restated transition services  products and asset agreement would be applied to the principal balance of the promissory note 
additionally  pursuant to the settlement agreement with motorola  we are required to maintain a minimum cash balance beginning in september in conjunction with the execution of the settlement agreement  iridium satellite and motorola also terminated the senior subordinated term loan agreement dated december  by and among them 
material trends and uncertainties iridium s industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services  increased demand for communications services by the department of defense  or dod  disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  a broad and expanding wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets  a growing number of new products and services and related applications  improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings  regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services  particularly among maritime end users  a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services equipment  and geographic market expansion through the receipt of licenses in additional countries 
nonetheless  as we continue the iridium business  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties  including our ability to develop iridium next and related ground infrastructure  and develop products and services for iridium next  including our ability to continue to access the facility to meet our future capital requirements for the construction of the iridium next satellites  our ability to maintain the health  capacity  control and level of service of our existing satellite network until and during the transition to iridium next  changes in general economic  business and industry conditions  our reliance on a single primary gateway and a primary satellite network operations center  competition from other mobile satellite service providers and  to a lesser extent  from the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures  our ability to maintain our relationship with us government customers  particularly the dod  rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry  reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products  services and applications effectively  reliance on single source suppliers for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand  reliance on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  where the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue  and our ability to obtain sufficient internally generated cash flows to fund a portion of the costs associated with iridium next and support ongoing business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and those of iridium  as our predecessor  is based upon our consolidated financial statements and those of iridium  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  useful lives of property and equipment  long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation and other estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
