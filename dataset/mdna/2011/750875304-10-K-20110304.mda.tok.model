prior to  substantially all of our net revenue was derived from the commissions we earned on the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties 
since  we have added multiple sources of revenue  including lead development services and hosted application software 
background we completed our initial public offering in november  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during the period from the initial public offering through  we focused on expanding our market share of the sale of service contracts for our clients 
in february  we completed our first acquisition  sunset direct  which added a new service offering the generation of sales leads  or lead generation  for clients 
sunset direct provided us with new clients for our service contract sales solution 
we relocated most of our operations from california to sunset direct s lower cost location in texas 
our net revenues grew to million in from million in this growth was due both to million  or  year over year growth excluding acquisitions in our service contract sales solution and million from our lead development services 
in  we incurred losses of million  due in part to redundancy  severance and other transition costs incurred in moving our base of operations to texas 
we achieved our first profitable quarter in the period ended march  due primarily to revenue growth from existing and new customers and the lower costs resulting from the relocation of our operations to texas 
our acquisition of viewcentral in september added hosted application software for training sales to 
table of contents our service offerings and a significant new customer base 
we reported net revenue of million for the year  representing year over year growth  excluding acquisitions  of  in addition to the million of net revenue from our hosted application software for training sales offering 
we were profitable in each quarter of and reported net income of million for the year 
in january  we acquired cas systems to provide additional complementary lead development functionality  customers  execution expertise and an international presence with its location near montreal  canada 
in july  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of qinteraction limited  which operates an offshore call center located in the philippines 
qinteraction provides a variety of business solutions including inbound sales and order taking  inbound customer care  outbound telemarketing and lead generation  logistics support  and back office processing 
the nature of these services is highly complementary to our other lead development and contract sales product offerings 
in october  we acquired the ecommerce technology of grow commerce 
grow commerce provides hosting of fan club and membership websites that offer monthly subscriptions and the ability for fee based downloading of music  videos and other items 
additionally  the technology offers the ability to route orders of merchandise for fulfillment 
we continued to integrate and leverage the grow commerce assets into our ecommerce strategy during the fiscal year 
in january  we acquired optima consulting partners limited optima  a bb lead development provider with offices then in the united kingdom  france  and germany 
during  we integrated our european operations into one primary office in the united kingdom and closed our canadian call center facility 
on february   we received written notice from sun microsystems that they had elected to terminate the global inside sales program statement of work agreement dated march   effective as of february  the notice followed the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle corporation and affected the contract sales services that we were performing for sun 
the global inside sales program services accounted for approximately of our fiscal annual net revenue 
the global inside sales agreement had a minimum term with notice periods to august  we entered into a settlement agreement on march   and received a cash payment of  from oracle corporation for the buyout of the global inside sales agreement 
the settlement payment was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of in addition  oracle agreed to reimburse us  for employee severance costs related to terminating employees who worked on the global inside sales program 
this reimbursement was recognized in payroll and payroll tax expense to offset the employee severance costs 
we reported net revenue of million in  representing an decline over the prior year due primarily to customer losses including the loss of sun microsystems during we reported a net loss of million for net revenue we derive revenue from the following the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties contract sales  from the provision of services related to the development of qualified leads and appointments lead development  from the licensing of our hosted application software platform for our clients training sales training sales  and from transaction fees related to the grow commerce ecommerce technology 
service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions contract sales 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions and warranty extensions 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our net revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our client s customer 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the amount payable by our clients customer based on the agreement with our client 
we 
table of contents record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms  generally to days from the initial sale 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale  and none of our clients customers represented more than of our net revenue 
because our revenue from sales of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions are commission based  this revenue can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have two to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
we also provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development 
we provide lead development services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 
some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
application software training sales 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one year terms  and are often paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
ecommerce 
during  we acquired the ecommerce technology of grow commerce along with their existing customer base 
grow commerce provides hosting of fan club and membership websites that offer monthly subscriptions and the ability for fee based downloading of music  videos and other items 
additionally  the ecommerce technology offers the ability to route orders of merchandise for fulfillment 
we license this hosted ecommerce software on a month to month basis to our clients 
clients are typically invoiced at the beginning of each month in advance for their monthly hosting fees for that month and for the media downloads and merchandise orders from the previous month 
payment terms are days from receipt of invoice and we typically recognize revenue when the monthly invoice payments are received 
ecommerce revenue is included with our contract sales revenue for and as the total amount is insignificant for both years 
gross margin gross margin is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products and services or delivering our services to our clients 
cost of services include compensation costs of sales personnel  sales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs of services are personnel related and are mostly variable in relation to our net revenue 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margins will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses  participation in trade shows and conferences and client integration costs 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our rainmaker revenue delivery platform 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we have also invested in the continued development of our revenue delivery platform 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  and legal  audit and other professional fees 
most of these costs relate to personnel  insurance and facilities and are relatively fixed 
stock based compensation financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and software licenses  and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of several businesses in the past five years  and accordingly have been amortizing the intangible assets  other than goodwill  acquired in these transactions 
we took a charge to write down a significant portion of our amortizable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of and as a result amortization expense decreased significantly in in january  we purchased optima adding  to our amortizable intangible assets 
see the discussions below regarding the goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment of goodwill other intangible assets 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on leases to secure equipment  software and other financing agreements  foreign currency gains losses  and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and has reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with gaap  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition and financial statement presentation  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  and fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals  lead development services  software subscriptions for hosted internet sales of web based training and from hosting fees related to the grow commerce ecommerce technology 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our clients service contracts and maintenance renewals on the net basis  which represents the amount billed to the end customer less the amount paid to our client 
revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from a client s customer is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our software 
table of contents application subscriptions of hosted online sales of web based training ratably over each contract period 
since these software subscriptions are usually paid in advance  we have recorded a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of subscriptions that will be earned over the next one to two years 
we also evaluate our agreements for multiple element arrangements 
our agreements typically do not contain multiple deliverables 
however  in the few instances where our agreements have contained multiple deliverables  they usually do not have value to our customers on a standalone basis  and therefore the deliverables are considered together as one unit of accounting 
revenue is then recorded using the proportional performance model  where revenue is recognized as performance occurs over the term of the contract and any initial set up fees are recognized over the estimated customer life 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectability 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our clients customers and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition  we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets we completed several acquisitions during the period january  through december  goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in our analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other subsequent measurement in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
in our analysis of other finite lived amortizable intangible assets  we apply the guidance of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and trade names of the businesses we have acquired 
in the th quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation required under fasb asc and concluded that goodwill was impaired along with our other intangible assets under fasb asc the impairment was a result of our market capitalization declining significantly with the price of our stock  declining sales  depressed market conditions  deteriorating industry trends  and a significant downward revision of our forecasts 
the ultimate result of the impairment evaluation was a charge in the th 
table of contents quarter of million to write off the entire amount of goodwill on two of our reporting units lead development and rainmaker asia and a charge of approximately million to write off a majority of the other intangible assets contained in these same two reporting units 
in january  we acquired optima  assigning million to goodwill and  to amortizable intangible assets 
in the th quarter of and again in the th quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and concluded that our remaining goodwill balance was not impaired 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill recorded on our contract sales reporting unit and million in goodwill recorded on our rainmaker europe reporting unit 
based on our analysis performed in the th quarter of  the estimated fair values of the contract sales and rainmaker europe reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 
we report segment results in accordance with fasb asc  segment reporting 
the method for determining what information is reported is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments for making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance 
the company s chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis  accompanied by detailed information listing revenues by customer and product line  for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
currently the chief operating decision maker does not use product line financial performance as a basis for business operating decisions 
accordingly  the company has concluded that it has one operating and reportable segment 
however  in accordance with fasb asc  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
thus  our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are contract sales  lead development  rainmaker asia and rainmaker europe 
long lived assets long lived assets including our purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
in the th quarter of  in connection with the goodwill impairment testing discussed above  we had to evaluate our other long lived assets which included amortized intangible assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of 
table of contents leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  internal use software and fasb asc  website development costs 
this guidance requires that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of fasb asc and asc have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific outsource client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
the liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in and  the deferred tax asset was subject to a valuation allowance and therefore is not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is limited and we may not be able to fully utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce our tax rates 
fasb asc  income taxes  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under this guidance  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy for recording interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes 
penalties  interest paid and interest received are recorded in interest and other expense  net  in the statement of operations 
there were immaterial amounts accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of december  stock based compensation fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note for further discussion of this statement and its effects on the financial statements presented herein 

table of contents foreign currency translation during january  we established a canadian foreign subsidiary and subsequently purchased the canadian based assets of cas systems 
additionally  in july  we purchased qinteraction limited and its philippine based subsidiary

net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in interest and other expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant client concentrations we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers of a limited number of clients 
in the year ended december   three clients accounted for or more of our net revenue  with sun microsystems representing approximately of our net revenue  hewlett packard representing approximately of our net revenue and symantec representing approximately of our net revenue

the global inside sales program services accounted for approximately of our fiscal annual net revenue  the global inside sales agreement had a minimum term with notice periods to august  we entered into a settlement agreement on march   and received a cash payment of  from oracle corporation for the buyout of the global inside sales agreement 
the settlement payment was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of in addition  oracle agreed to reimburse us  for employee severance costs related to terminating employees who worked on the global inside sales program 
this reimbursement was recognized in payroll and payroll tax expense to offset the employee severance costs 
a client that provides business process call center services that has been outsourcing its asia call center activities to us was acquired in december we are currently in discussions with this client s new parent company to provide managed call center services for their new facility 
this may take affect in the next three to nine months 
this is likely to result in some decrease in revenue compared to the outsourced call center services we now provide this client 
the outcome of this negotiation is presently unknown 
the potential impact on revenue is not determinable at this time 
it s possible that our current agreement with this client could terminate without transitioning to a new managed services arrangement if we are not able to come to mutually agreeable terms 
services to this client accounted for approximately of our annual net revenue and of our fourth quarter net revenue 
we have outsourced services agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging through june our agreements with hewlett packard  a significant client  expire at various dates from october 
table of contents through may  and can generally be terminated prior to expiration with ninety days notice 
our agreements with symantec  a significant client  expire at various dates from may through june  and can generally be terminated prior to expiration with ninety days notice 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
related party transactions we made purchases of computer equipment and services from several vendors including hewlett packard  one of our largest clients that contributed or more of our net revenue for the year ended december  during the years ended december   and  we purchased equipment from hewlett packard for approximately   and  respectively

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the following table shows the change in net revenue by product line between the periods in thousands year ended december  change change contract sales lead development training sales total net revenue from our contract sales product line decreased compared to the prior year as customer losses of approximately million and lower contract sales net revenue with hewlett packard of approximately million exceeded net revenue growth from existing and new customers 
lead development product line net revenue declined predominantly from decreases in net revenues from existing us clients  including sun microsystems  as they reduced their marketing budgets or canceled programs during the year  offset partially by increased sales in asia and europe 
the acquisition of optima in the first quarter of contributed approximately million in lead development product line net revenue during the year ended december  net revenue from our training sales product line declined as compared to the prior year due to customer attrition 
costs of services and gross margin 
costs of services decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the decrease is attributable primarily to reductions in our telesales workforce and is in line with the decline in net revenue 
our gross margin percentage decreased to in the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of our business from contract sales to lead development  which has a lower gross margin percentage 
our contract sales product line decreased to of total net revenue for the year ended december   as compared to of total net revenue in the comparable period 
revenue from our lead development product line increased to of total net revenue for the year ended december   as compared to of total net revenue in the comparable period

we estimate that gross margin will fluctuate during depending on the volume of net revenue and based on the revenue mix 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the decrease is primarily due to approximately  decrease in overall personnel costs due to reductions in sales and marketing staff and decreased commissions from reductions in sales 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in as compared to as we hired a new senior vice president of sales and marketing with an e commerce and software industry background to increase our sales and marketing effort to reach more clients and drive higher revenue growth 
technology and development expenses 
technology and development expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the decrease is primarily attributable to our focus in on developing our ecommerce and training platforms that will benefit future periods resulting in a million increase in capitalized development costs partially offset by a  increase in fees paid to outside consultants 
we expect technology and development expenses to decrease in as compared to as we continue to reduce spending due to the challenging macroeconomic environment 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to approximately  in costs to exit our montreal facility   in higher stock compensation charges  and  in costs due to the acquisition of optima offset partially by cost savings initiatives 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in as compared to as we continue to reduce spending 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the period 
depreciation expense decreased due to a smaller asset base for facility and equipment in the us and canada
