overview of fiscal year operating results revenues and operating income loss based on our segments for the fiscal years ended april  and  are as follows in millions revenues operating income loss fiscal year ended april  segment eastern western recycling other total for the year ended april   we reported revenues of million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended april  solid waste revenues decreased with lower disposal and waste to energy prices accounting for a decrease  lower collection volumes of  a decline in commodity prices  related to a divestiture in the eastern region  and decline from the closure of a landfill 
these decreases were partially offset by positive effect of disposal  recycling  and waste to energy volumes  from collection and recycling price increases  higher commodity volume  and from acquisitions 
major accounts revenues included in other increased  in fiscal year compared to the prior year primarily due to higher volumes of offset by price decline 
as a percentage of total recycling revenues  recycling revenues increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year with related primarily to a steady uptrend in commodity price offset by a decline in commodity volumes 
eastern region revenues decreased million  or  in fiscal year compared to the prior year primarily due to the closure of a landfill  a divestiture  negative collection and processing and recycling volume  and a decline in waste to energy price and commodity volume 
these declines were offset by collection  processing and recycling  and disposal price improvement and increased disposal  waste to energy  processing and recycling volumes  and a tuck in acquisition 
western region revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior year due to higher disposal  commodity  and recycling volumes  
table of contents improved collection and commodity pricing  and acquisitions 
these increases were offset by decreases in disposal price as well as a decline in collection volumes 
operating income for fiscal year was million compared to operating income of million in fiscal year our operating results were negatively impacted by the million impairment on long lived assets  increases in cost of operations and general and administration expenses  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue when compared to fiscal year  along with decreases in collection and recycling revenues due to lower volumes and a divestiture 
operating results were positively impacted by increased disposal  processing and recycling  and major accounts revenues  lower depreciation and landfill amortization due to the closure of the pinetree landfill  a million gain on bargain purchase related to the mckean landfill business  and a million gain on sale of assets in the first quarter of fiscal year on a segment basis  operating income for the eastern region decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in revenues combined with the million impairment on long lived assets and increased operating costs associated with maintenance and labor  offset partially by lower landfill amortization 
operating income for the western region decreased million despite the fact that revenues increased million year over year and a million gain on bargain purchase related to the mckean landfill business was recorded in fiscal year the decrease in operating income was associated with increases in cost of operations  general and administration expenses  and landfill amortization  which outweighed the increases in revenue and the gain on bargain purchase 
we recorded net income of million for the fiscal year ended april  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year  primarily due to the fiscal gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  amounting to million 
the fiscal year operating income discussed above was offset by a million loss on debt refinancing  as well as declining performance from our unconsolidated subsidiary  greenfiber 
our pre tax loss was million in fiscal year compared to a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year down from million in fiscal year fiscal year net income adjusted for the gain on disposal of discontinued operations and income loss from discontinued operations totaled million 
this resulted in an increase to net income of million when compared to the fiscal year total of million 
depreciation and amortization was lower in fiscal year by million over the prior year 
loss on debt refinancing was higher in fiscal year by million over the prior year 
an asset impairment charge resulted in a million increase year over year

our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction  as well as site and cell closure 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year acquisitions and divestitures we completed the divestiture of our great northern recycling canadian operation in the third quarter of fiscal year for a settlement amount of million in cash 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also completed the divestiture of our domestic brokerage operations for a settlement amount of million in cash 
this resulted in a gain on disposal of discontinued operations net of tax amounting to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively

also in fiscal year  we acquired the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania in exchange for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
we acquired the mckean county landfill business out of bankruptcy proceedings and recognized a bargain purchase gain of million based on the amount by which the fair value of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price consideration 
in fiscal year  we acquired two solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in notes payable to the seller and liabilities assumed 
in fiscal year  we acquired three solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash consideration 
general revenues revenues in our eastern and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  landfill gas to energy  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
recycling revenues consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
we also generate and sell electricity under a contract at our waste to energy facility and at certain of our landfill facilities 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income loss on the equity method in our results of operations 
we also have a interest in a company that markets an incentive based recycling service and a interest in a surety company which provides surety bonds to us to secure contractual performance for municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post closure obligations 
we accounts for these investments under the cost method of accounting 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts 

table of contents our revenues are shown net of inter company eliminations 
we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentages and dollars in millions of revenue attributable to services provided 
fiscal year ended april  collection disposal power generation processing and recycling solid waste operations major accounts recycling total revenues the dollar decrease in collection revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower volumes and a divestiture partially offset by price increases and the effect of acquisitions 
disposal revenues decreased slightly in fiscal year due to the closure of a landfill  a divestiture  and a decline in disposal price offset by higher volumes 
waste to energy volumes increased in fiscal year but declines in price resulted in a revenue decline for the power generation operations 
the dollar increase in processing and recycling revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to stronger volume and price increases 
major accounts revenues improved in fiscal year with higher volumes offset slightly by price decline 
as noted above  recycling revenues were positively impacted as a result of a sharp improvement in average commodity prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year offset to a lesser extent by commodity volume decline 
operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  workers compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to development projects and pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided  and will in the future provide  accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds

the million increase in loss on debt refinancing in fiscal year versus fiscal year is attributable to the non cash write off of unamortized financing costs associated with the repayment of financing lease obligations  a write off of deferred financing costs associated with the term loan  million  and senior subordinated notes  million  a write off of the discount and premium associated with the term loan  million  and senior subordinated notes  million  and a gain associated with the discount on the tender of the senior subordinated notes  million  and a loss associated with the consent payment and on the senior subordinated notes  million 
the million increase in loss from equity method investment in fiscal year versus fiscal year is due primarily to decreased performance in our joint venture interest in greenfiber associated with a continued slowdown in the housing market 
in addition to these items  our loss from continuing operations was further affected by the following non cash adjustments 
lower depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal year versus fiscal year  which resulted in a million decrease 
lower landfill amortization expense in fiscal year versus fiscal year  which resulted in a million decrease  due primarily to the closure of the pinetree landfill which ceased operations in the quarter ended january  the decrease in deferred taxes in fiscal year versus was primarily associated with the current year tax benefit from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets resulting from the gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
in both fiscal years and  our cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by changes in our asset and liability accounts  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures 
in fiscal year the negative impact decreased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year although our asset and liability balances vary year over year  the change is normally driven by changes in accounts receivable  which is primarily driven by revenue and the timing of payments  accounts payable  which is driven by costs incurred and the timing of payments  and accrued expenses and other liabilities  which is driven by changes related to accrued interest and accrued capping  closure  and post closure costs 
in both fiscal year and  our cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by changes in accounts receivable 
however  in fiscal year the negative impact decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year accounts payable had a positive impact on our cash flow from operations in both fiscal year and cash flow from operations related to accounts payable increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in both fiscal year and  our cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
in fiscal year  the negative impact increased by million to million from million 
the primary reasons for this negative impact relate to cash flow changes associated with taxes payable related to the gain on discontinued operations  accrued interest and accrued capping  closure  and post closure costs 
in fiscal year  accrued interest decreased by million to million at april  from million at april  the decrease was due to a debt reduction associated with the payoff of the term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and lower interest rates due to the refinancing of our revolver and the repurchase and redemption of our senior subordinated notes and related issuance of our notes 
the cash flow impact related to accrued capping  closure and post closure costs as it pertains to the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities  excluding the non cash charge related to depletion of landfill operating lease obligations  decreased million year over year due to a million decrease in obligations incurred and a million decrease in revisions in estimates 
in fiscal year our cash flow from operations was positively impacted by changes in prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets totaling million 
this represents a favorable cash flow impact year over year of million as the cash flow impact was a favorable million in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to million in lower payments for landfill operating lease contracts in 
table of contents fiscal year  million in proceeds received from the divestiture in the first quarter of fiscal year  offset by million less in proceeds from the sale of equipment year over year  million of payments associated with the purchase of gas rights  and million in additional capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in cash used relates primarily to the million paydown of the term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year offset by additional borrowings including the notes 
in fiscal year we acquired two solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash and million in notes payable 
also in fiscal year  we acquired the mckean county landfill business in pennsylvania in exchange for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
we acquired the mckean county landfill business out of bankruptcy proceedings and recognized a bargain purchase gain of million based on the amount by which the fair value of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price consideration 
in fiscal year  we acquired two solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in notes payable to the seller and liabilities assumed 
in fiscal year  we acquired three solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash consideration 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow and the revolver 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures and acquisitions 
we use a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices including entering into fixed price contracts and entering into hedges which mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices  resulting in a fixed price being received from these sales 
as of april   to minimize our commodity exposure  we were party to three commodity hedging agreements 
for further discussion on commodity price volatility  see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price volatility below 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
we may from time to time issue securities thereunder in an amount of up to million 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt financing lease obligations interest obligations operating leases capping closure post closure total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year in addition to the above obligations  we have unrecognized tax benefits at april  of approximately million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements 

table of contents inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the northeastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
limitations on ownership of notes pursuant to the first paragraph of section of the indentures governing the second lien notes and the notes  no beneficial holder of the second lien notes and or notes is permitted to knowingly acquire second lien notes and or notes if such person would own or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated and must dispose of second lien notes and notes or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold  if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained 
we have agreed that  for so long as any of the second lien notes remain outstanding  we will furnish to the holders of the second lien notes  in each quarterly and annual report  the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder s compliance with these ownership restrictions 
as of april   that dollar amount was million 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
landfills the cost estimates for capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each capping event and the timing of construction related to each capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill development costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 

table of contents landfill capping costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill closure and post closure closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and expansion airspace 
remaining permitted airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills 
the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 

table of contents expansion airspace we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances 
to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above 
these criteria are annually evaluated by our engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards  an airspace utilization factor  or auf  is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities recorded environmental liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable 
these liabilities include potentially responsible party  or prp  investigations  settlements  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
goodwill and other intangibles we do not amortize goodwill 
we annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year by applying a fair value test 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments and recycling  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
we test goodwill at this reporting unit level because the business is managed and reported at this level 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings 

table of contents to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate  applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment 
the goodwill impairment analysis performed for fiscal years ended april  and did not result in an impairment charge 
as of april   we determined that the indicated fair value of the western reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by which we believe substantially exceeds the carrying value 
the indicated fair value of the recycling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
the carrying value of the eastern reporting unit goodwill is deminimus and its impact to our operating results would be immaterial 
as of april   goodwill allocated to the recycling reporting unit amounted to million 
the step test for the recycling reporting unit and the resulting calculation of the indicated fair value was performed as described above based on certain specific assumptions 
we relied on a weighted average cost of capital of for this reporting unit which takes into consideration certain industry and specific premiums 
we utilized a long term growth rate of approximately for this reporting unit which considers industry research and management s representations as to the prospects for long term growth in this industry 
we have experienced some volatility in growth in the recycling reporting unit associated with the pricing of the underlying commodities that are processed and marketed 
the long term growth assumed in our model represents more consistent growth 
we have assumed a tax rate of in our model which is based on our historical effective tax rate with some consideration given to rates observed within the industry as well 
recovery of long lived assets we continually consider whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets other than goodwill or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
long lived assets include  for example  capitalized landfill costs  other property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit 
there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 
if an impairment indicator occurs  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we group our long lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
to determine fair value we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group 
this analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and 
table of contents growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved 
we may also rely on third party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate volatility we had interest rate risk relating to approximately million of long term debt at april  the interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt was approximately at april  should the average interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt change by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by million 
the remainder of our long term debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
commodity price volatility through our recycling operation  we market a variety of materials  including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard occ and old newsprint onp  plastics  glass  ferrous and aluminum metals 
we use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from commodity price fluctuations  such as indexed purchases  floor prices  fixed price agreements  and revenue share arrangements 
in addition  as of april  we were party to seven commodity hedge contracts that manage pricing fluctuations on a portion of our occ and onp volumes 
these contracts expire through september we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we expect to be able to replace our expiring hedges with existing or new counterparties  however  the availability and pricing terms at any given time will be subject to prevailing market conditions 
if commodity prices were to have changed by in the year ended april   the impact on our operating income is estimated to have been between million and million based on the observed impact of commodity price changes on operating income margin during the years ended april  and april  our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is unique relative to revenue sharing  tipping or processing fees and other arrangements 
the above estimated ranges of operating income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially
