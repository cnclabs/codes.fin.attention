item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with selected financial data  and the financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
information regarding these forward looking statements can be found in the preface to part i  item business of this form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule compounds with novel chemical structures and distinct mechanisms of action 
we have generated a strong pipeline of differentiated product candidates in oncology and autoimmune diseases 
we are focused on maximizing the therapeutic and commercial value of these molecules by developing potential first in class and or best in class treatment options for patients with unmet needs 
we were incorporated as myriad pharmaceuticals  inc in delaware in january as a new  wholly owned subsidiary of myriad genetics  inc in order to effect the separation and spin off of myriad genetics research and drug development businesses as a stand alone  independent  publicly traded company 
in connection with the formation of this new subsidiary  myriad genetics existing subsidiary  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc  changed its corporate name to myriad therapeutics  inc  and we adopted the name of myriad pharmaceuticals  inc which was subsequently changed to myrexis  inc 
effective july  on june   myriad genetics contributed substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its research and drug development businesses as well as million in cash and marketable securities to us and effected the spin off of our company through a pro rata dividend distribution to its stockholders of all outstanding shares of our common stock 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  drug development 
during the years ended june  and  we reported  and  respectively in revenues associated with research services related to short term research agreements and a net loss of million and million  respectively 
in june  we announced several strategic initiatives to focus our efforts on our oncology pipeline and to conserve our financial resources  including a reduction in workforce affecting employees 
on march   we announced a corporate reorganization to focus resources on our current portfolio of clinical and preclinical drug candidates 
the reorganization included an immediate reduction in our workforce by employees or approximately 
the reduction was primarily in our internal drug discovery group and related support functions 
in addition  we have stopped all contract research services activity 
in connection with the reorganization  we recorded severance costs of approximately million in the three months ended march   which were fully paid before june  these expenses reflected in the statement of operations include million in general and administrative and million in research and development for year ended june  in september  we announced we had completed an in depth review of our drug development pipeline  incorporating extensive inputs from both internal and independent external analyses 
as a result  we made a strategic business decision to suspend any further development of our lead drug candidate azixa  which is in phase development for the treatment of advanced primary and metastatic tumors with brain involvement 
this decision was not based on any single factor 
our review took into consideration the accumulated data from our clinical trials to date  the evolving competitive environment in gbm  including ongoing studies of competitive 
table of contents drug candidates that are in more advanced stages of development  inputs from key opinion leaders  updated cost and timing estimates  and other factors affecting the risks and opportunities relating to the development of azixa 
on the basis of these inputs  we concluded that completing the phase b clinical trial would require a disproportionate investment of time and resources relative to its likelihood of technical and regulatory success  when compared to our other programs 
we expect to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future and that such losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our drug research and development expenses include costs incurred for our drug candidates currently  the only costs we track by each drug candidate are external costs such as services provided to us by clinical research organizations  manufacturing of drug supply  and other outsourced research 
we do not assign or allocate internal costs such as salaries and benefits  facilities costs  lab supplies and the costs of preclinical research and studies to individual development programs 
we also incurred costs related to external research collaborations from our research services business 
we track all underlying principal costs associated with our research collaborations 
all development costs for our drug candidates and external research collaborations are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expense for azixa for which development was recently suspended  our clinical stage drug candidate  mpc  our preclinical stage drug candidates  mpc  mpc and mpc  and our discontinued drug candidates mpc  mpc  and flurizan during the fiscal years ended june   and are as follows years ended june  in thousands external costs  drug candidates azixa mpc mpc mpc mpc mpc mpc flurizan sub total direct costs internal costs  drug candidates preclinical development costs external research collaborations total research and development amount includes a million credit recorded in fiscal resulting from a favorable change in estimate for outside clinical services which were later terminated due to the discontinuation of the program 
amount includes a million credit recorded in fiscal  resulting from the difference in an estimated sub license fee accrual recorded in fiscal and amounts actually paid in the timing and amount of any future expenses  completion dates  and revenues for our drug candidates is not readily determinable due to the early stage of these development programs 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
while expenses associated with the completion of our current clinical programs are expected to be substantial and increase  we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our development organization  regulatory 
table of contents requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from our drug candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including the scope  rate of progress  and expense of our clinical trials and other development activities  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials  the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  our ability to market  commercialize  manufacture and supply  and achieve market acceptance for our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  and the filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcement of any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in the enrollment of patients in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows income taxes  clinical trial expenses  share based payment expense  and impairment of long lived assets 
income taxes our income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  or the expected results from any future tax examinations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future provision for income taxes 
those factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  the results of any future tax examinations  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  past levels of r d spending  acquisitions  changes in our corporate structure  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes all of which may result in periodic revisions to our provision for income taxes 

table of contents developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential uncertain tax positions  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowance we deem necessary to offset deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance to fully offset our deferred tax assets 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements  an adverse determination by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and penalties on income tax items are included as a component of overall income tax expense 
clinical trial expenses the cost of our clinical trials is based  in part  on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations  or the cros 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of our drug candidates 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract  are subject to negotiation and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  we recognize direct expenses related to each patient enrolled in a clinical trial on an estimated cost per patient basis as services are performed 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from cros  such as estimated costs per patient  to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial  which we would confirm directly with the cro 
if our cros were to either under or over report the costs that they have incurred or if there is a change in the estimated per patient costs  it could have an impact on our clinical trial expenses during the period in which they report a change in estimated costs to us 
adjustments to our clinical trial accruals primarily relate to indirect costs  for which we place significant reliance on our cros for accurate information at the end of each reporting period 
share based payment expense share based compensation expense standards set accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and require us to recognize  as expense  in our statements of operations  the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the terms of each grant  the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
in connection with the separation and spin off from myriad genetics and related transactions  each outstanding myriad genetics stock option was converted into an adjusted myriad genetics common stock option  exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock as the original myriad genetics option  and a new myrexis common stock option  exercisable for one fourth of the number of shares of common stock as the original myriad genetics option 
an adjusted exercise price of each converted option was determined in 
table of contents accordance with section a and section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
all other terms of the converted options remain the same however  the vesting and expiration of the converted options will be based on the optionholder s continuing employment with myriad genetics or myrexis  as applicable  following the separation 
as a result of the option modifications that occurred in connection with the separation from myriad genetics  myriad genetics measured the potential accounting impact of these option modifications 
based upon the analysis  which included a comparison of the fair value of the modified options granted to our employees and directors immediately after the modification with the fair value of the original option immediately prior to the modification  it was determined that there was no incremental compensation expense 
all unrecognized compensation expense at june  that is related to myriad genetics options and myrexis options that are held by current myrexis employees and directors will be recognized by us over the remaining vesting term of the option 
all such expense relating to myrexis options held by current and former myriad genetics employees  directors or consultants will not be recognized by us 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping s carrying value and its fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
long lived assets such as intangible assets and property  plant and equipment are considered non financial assets  and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized 
results of operations the balance sheets as of june  and  and notes related thereto reflect the balances of myrexis as an independent company 
for all periods prior to june   amounts reflected in the results of operations are components of myriad genetics that constituted the research and drug development businesses that were separated 
those financial statements have been prepared using myriad genetics historical costs basis of the assets and liabilities of the various activities that reflect the combined results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of us as a component of myriad genetics 
specific costs attributable to our operations have been included in the financial statements 
the financial statements also include some proportional cost allocations of certain common costs of myriad genetics because these expenses were not specifically identified at the subsidiary level 
the basis of these allocations includes full time equivalent employees for the respective periods presented  square footage  and other appropriate allocation drivers 
the financial information for the years ended june  and  reflects the financial position  results of operations and cash flows for myrexis as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for the year ended june  in the financial statements reflects allocations for services historically provided to us by myriad genetics and does not include all of the expenses that would have been incurred had we been a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity  including  but not limited to  costs to implement accounting  human resource  payroll  purchasing  information technology  legal and other business functions and systems 

table of contents years ended june  and research revenue is comprised of research services related to short term research agreements 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in research revenue was primarily attributable to increased research services related to short term research agreements that were completed during the fiscal year 
as a result of the march corporate reorganization  we have stopped all contract research services activity going forward 
research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  equipments costs  and costs associated with our clinical trials 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased internal preclinical developments costs of approximately million resulting from a reduction in headcount  decreased external drug candidate costs associated with our hiv drug candidate of million  decreased costs of million associated with the development of azixa and the timing of the phase b trial initiation  and decreased costs of million associated with mpc due to the completion of current studies  and decreased external research collaboration costs of million associated with a reduction in headcount 
we expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate over the next several years as we conduct additional clinical trials to support the clinical development of our hsp inhibitor program  and advance other drug candidates into clinical development 
we expect to see reduced external drug development costs as a result of the decision to suspend further development of azixa which will be partially offset by increased costs associated with our preclinical stage drug candidates 
we expect to see a reduction in internal development expenses related to salaries and benefits and lab supplies as a result of the march corporate reorganization 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for business development  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million  compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses of was due primarily to a decrease in expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount in june we incurred million in external acquisition expenses in connection with the proposed merger with javelin pharmaceuticals  inc that was terminated in april these expenses were offset by million in stipulated expenses reimbursed by javelin plus a termination fee of million 
these reimbursed expenses are presented in the financials for the year ended june   as an offset to total general and administrative costs 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a result of the march corporate reorganization 
other income expense for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to for the fiscal year ended june  other income reflects interest income and realized gains on our marketable securities offset by a loss on impairment of assets of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
other income for the year ended june   includes a million one time grant received in november as a part of the qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section d of the internal revenue code 
years ended june  and research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in research revenue was primarily attributable to the completion of genomic sequencing research collaboration and a long term contract that were completed during the fiscal year 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 

table of contents research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased external drug development costs of approximately million resulting from the discontinuance of our hiv drug candidate mpc  decreased external drug development costs of approximately million resulting from the timing of studies related to azixa  a decrease of million in expenditures relating to mpc  a compound that did not transfer from myriad genetics to myrexis in connection with the spin off  a million credit from the former drug candidate flurizan recorded in fiscal resulting from the difference in an estimated sublicense fee accrual recorded in fiscal and amounts actually paid in  and a decrease of approximately million in preclinical development costs as a result of a reduction in headcount 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million  compared to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses of was due primarily to an increase in expenses associated with being a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity  including  but not limited to  costs to implement accounting  human resource  payroll  purchasing  information technology  legal and other business functions and systems 
in addition to these certain costs  we incurred million in external acquisition expenses in connection with the proposed merger with javelin pharmaceuticals  inc that was terminated in april these expenses were offset by million in stipulated expenses reimbursed by javelin plus a termination fee of million 
these reimbursed expenses are presented in the financials for the year ended june   as an offset to total general and administrative costs 
other income expense for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to for the fiscal year ended june  other income reflects interest income and realized gains on our marketable securities offset by a loss on disposal of assets 
prior to june   all cash and investments were held and managed by myriad genetics and  as a result  we recognized no interest income in our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used by operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
the change in cash flow from operating activity can be attributed primarily to the higher net loss in fiscal offset  in part  by higher non cash charges associated with share based compensation recorded in fiscal our investing activities provided million in cash during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used during the prior fiscal year 
the change is primarily due to the maturities and selling of our marketable investment securities 
in addition  we invested million in capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended june  in leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment for the new facility that we took occupancy of in january compared to million during the fiscal year ended june  we anticipate our investment in additional equipment and leasehold improvements will be minimal in the future 
approximately million in cash was provided by financing activities during fiscal  compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
financing activities in fiscal and were comprised primarily of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock awards 
as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of june  we believe that with our existing capital resources  we 
table of contents will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations through at least june   although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including progress in and results from our clinical trial of mpc  failure or delays in advancing our preclinical drug candidates  or other drug candidates we may develop in the future  into clinical trials  results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our drug candidates  issues in manufacturing our drug candidates or approved products  regulatory developments or enforcement in the united states and foreign countries  developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  if any cover our common stock  failure to secure adequate capital to fund our operations if and when needed  or the issuance of equity securities at prices below the current market price  public concern over our drug candidates or any approved products  litigation  future sales of our common stock  general market conditions  changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  failure of any of our drug candidates  if approved  to achieve commercial success  economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises  period to period fluctuations in our financial results  and overall fluctuations in us equity markets 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval that have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 

table of contents if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
we have an effective universal shelf registration statement on form s pursuant to which we have up to million of securities available for issuance 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total less than one year years years more than years contractual services lease obligations total contractual services represent financial commitments for drug development and clinical trial activities 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on currently available information 
the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ depending on the timing of goods or services received and other factors 
the table above only includes payment obligations that are fixed or determinable 
the table excludes potential milestone payments we may be required to pay under license agreements in the aggregate of up to million based on the progress of our drug candidates  as the likelihood and timing of such payments is not yet determinable 
the table also excludes royalties payable to third parties based on future sales of any of our drug candidates that may be approved for sale in the future  as the amount  timing  and likelihood of any such payments are unknown 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  revenues  or operating results during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities which are subject to interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of highly liquid securities of various types and maturities of two years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of these marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june  and  we have determined  hypothetically  that in the event of an increase of basis points in a key market interest rate  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would not have a material effect on our financial condition or on our financial statements as a whole
