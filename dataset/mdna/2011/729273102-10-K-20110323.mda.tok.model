item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bank holding company for plumas bank  a california state chartered commercial bank 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related  commercial and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating in california  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in california  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the bank s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense 
additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth 
credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance 
cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance 
the overall allowance consists of two primary components  specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are not impaired 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans 
we cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio  which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established 
other real estate owned 
other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo is charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 

table of contents income taxes 
the company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary 
the allocation of income tax expense benefit represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
stock based compensation 
compensation cost is recognized for all stock based awards that vest subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate since the grant date fair value is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which involves making estimates of the assumptions used  including the expected term of the option  expected volatility over the option term  expected dividend yield over the option term and risk free interest rate 
in addition  when determining the compensation expense to amortize over the vesting period  management makes estimates about the expected forfeiture rate of options 
the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital 
it pertains to the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein

however  the effect of this downturn on operations lessened in the company recorded net income of thousand for the year ended december   an increase of million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  and up thousand from net income of thousand for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses was still significantly elevated from historical norms at million  but was down million from levels 
additionally our provision for losses on oreo declined by million from million in to thousand during we also benefited from a million increase in non interest income primarily related to a million gain on the sale of our merchant processing portfolio and million in gains on sale of investments 
non interest expense  exclusive of the provision for oreo losses  declined by million with reductions of million in salary and benefits  thousand in occupancy and equipment expense and thousand in all other non interest expense 
partially offsetting these items was a decline in net interest income of million 
the result was pretax income of million for the year ended december  this compares to a pretax loss of million in and pretax income of thousand in we recorded a provision for income taxes of thousand compared to tax benefits of million in and thousand in

while this account was very successful in generating deposits  we determined that we needed to reduce the rate paid to increase the profitability of the product 
the decline in now accounts relates to an million decline in balances from this product from million at december  to million at december  beginning in june of and ending in april of we offered a promotional time deposit with an month term and a rate 
the decline in time deposits is mostly related to maturities from this product 
time deposits are expected to continue to decline in as these promotional deposits mature  although we do expect a significant portion of these deposits to remain with the bank reinvested in other deposit products 
at december  we had million in these promotional time deposits 
total borrowings at december  were million  while no borrowings were outstanding at december  borrowings at december  consisted of million in a two year term fhlb advance  million in a three year term fhlb advance and million in a six month fhlb advance which matured on january  we chose to prepay both of the long term borrowings during july incurring a prepayment penalty as we had significant excess liquidity and no longer projected a need for these borrowings

provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision of thousand  or of pre tax income for the year ended december  the percentage for differs from the statutory rate as tax exempt income such as earnings on bank owned life insurance and municipal loan and investment income decrease taxable income 
during the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  or of pre tax loss for the year ended december  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings  which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors 
the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
more likely than not is defined as greater than a chance 
all available evidence  both positive and negative is considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
based upon our analysis of available evidence  we have determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred income tax assets as of december  and will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded 

table of contents financial condition loan portfolio 
the company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves

loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
the decline in these loans as a percentage of the company s loan portfolio reflects management s efforts to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans in and due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market

consequently  the results of operations and financial condition of the company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets 
in addition  the concentration of the company s operations in these areas of northeastern california and northwestern nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  fires and floods in these regions 
the rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or us treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes

the company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies 
the company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews 
the company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis  or more frequently as loan conditions change 
the management asset resolution committee marc reviews the asset quality of criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board of directors the board s loan committee reviews the asset quality of new loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board of directors 
in management s opinion  this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans 
the company has implemented marc to develop an action plan to significantly reduce nonperforming loans 
it consists of members of executive management  credit administration management and the board of directors  and the activities are governed by a formal written charter 
the marc meets at least monthly and reports to the board of directors 
more specifically  a formal plan to effect repayment and or disposition of every significant nonperforming loan relationship is developed and documented for review and on going oversight by the marc 
some of the strategies used include but are not limited to obtaining additional collateral  obtaining additional investor cash infusion  sale of the promissory note to an outside party  proceeding with foreclosure on the underlying collateral  legal action against borrower guarantors to encourage settlement of debt and or collect any deficiency balance owed 
each step includes a benchmark timeline to track progress 

table of contents marc also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of oreo properties  including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase oreo 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans  including current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  collateral  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent credit reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and state of the local economy 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company follows these guidelines 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement was also revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in addition  the company incorporates the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which represents the sec staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements  which include but are not limited to specific allocation determined in accordance with asc topic receivables formerly fas  accounting for impairment of a loan based on probable losses on specific loans 
general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 

table of contents specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified  impaired  and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are watch  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
watch loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful 
loans classified as loss are immediately charged off 
loans are consistently monitored against risk rating criteria 
as loans are identified that may warrant a classification change  they are discussed with the company s credit administration officers and appropriate risk grades are assigned 
there are several times in the life of a loan that this occurs loan origination loan renewal loan servicing actions change in terms  collateral release  etc 
annual financial review delinquency monitoring and follow up loan review process audit process if weaknesses or improvements are noted  a change in risk rating  if warranted by credit administration  will be made 
loans classified watch or below in an amount of  or more will be individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the bank s policy for determining and measuring impairment under fas formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
effective for the third quarter of  the company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for non impaired loans 
this modification incorporated historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter to identified pools of loans 
this modification did not have a material affect on the company s allowance for loans losses or provision for loan losses 
the discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 

table of contents the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs during the period to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans during the year ended december  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million down million from the million provision recorded during the year ended december  net charge offs totaled million during the year ended december  and million during net charge offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from during to during the year ended december  while we incurred significant charge offs during the period  million of the charge offs had been incorporated in the allowance for loan losses at december  as specific reserves on impaired loans 
we currently anticipate that net charge offs could range from approximately million to million in  the largest part of which are anticipated to be related to real estate loans and consistent with activity 
for other categories of loans we expect charge offs to be similar to activity 
however  given the lack of stability in the real estate market and the recent volatility in charge offs  there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not increase or decrease from this estimate 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses from december  is attributable to a million decrease in specific reserves related to impaired loans from million at december  to million at december  and a decrease of million in average loan balances 
general reserves increased by thousand to million at december  related to the decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december  the percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans increased from at december  to at december  the company places loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 

table of contents impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring tdr if the company  for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider 
restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms 
loans that are reported as tdrs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above 
the following table sets forth the amount of the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated 
loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
there were no troubled debt restructurings at december   or at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other vehicles owned total nonperforming assets interest income forgone on nonaccrual loans interest income recorded on a cash basis on nonaccrual loans nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming loans at december  were million  an increase of million from the million balance at december  of the total nonperforming loans at december   fifteen loans had principal balances ranging from million to thousand

specific reserves of million were allocated to these loans 
for all nonaccrual loans at december  specific reserves totaled million or of total nonaccrual loans 
additionally  the nonaccrual balances at december  are net of million in partial charge offs 

table of contents a substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged  if any 
at december  million of performing loans were classified as substandard 
further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the increases in impaired and nonperforming loans mostly relates to two large relationships totaling million 
these loans were measured for impairment and it was determined that a thousand specific allowance was required at december  the specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  million has been charged off against the impaired loans at december this compares to that had been charged off against impaired loans at december  the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  of income on such loans 
interest foregone on impaired loans totaled  thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  is appropriate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods
