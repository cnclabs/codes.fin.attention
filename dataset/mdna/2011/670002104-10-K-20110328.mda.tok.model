item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations restatement of consolidated financial statements  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the periods discussed herein 
the restatement process was highly time and resource intensive and involved substantial attention from management  as well as significant legal and accounting costs 
although we have now completed the restatement  we cannot guarantee that we will have no further inquiries from the sec or nasdaq regarding our restated consolidated financial statements or matters relating thereto 
any future inquiries from the sec or nasdaq as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will  regardless of the outcome  likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself 
further  many companies that have been required to restate their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and stockholder lawsuits related thereto 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results  and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting 
we are required by the sarbanes oxley act of to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we are likewise required  on an annual basis  to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose on a quarterly basis any material changes in those internal controls 

table of contents as described in item a controls and procedures elsewhere in this annual report on form k  in connection with the restatement process  we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with regard to having sufficient technical resources to appropriately analyze and account for complex derivative instruments  specifically with regard to our prior interpretation of asc  derivatives and hedging  as it related to the initial classification and subsequent accounting of registered warrants as equity instruments dating back to july upon a reassessment  we determined that we should have accounted for these warrants as liabilities instead of equity 
given this material weakness  management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  we plan to devote resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting  in particular over handling of complex derivative accounting issues 
as the company enters into transactions that involve complex accounting issues  it will consult with third party professionals with expertise in these matters as necessary to insure appropriate accounting treatment for such transactions 
the elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects 
any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis 
if our financial statements are not accurate  investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations or may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
likewise  if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the sec and nasdaq  we could face severe consequences from those authorities 
in either case  it could result in a material adverse effect on our business or have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of our financial statements will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of those controls 
the value of our warrants outstanding is subject to potentially material increases and decreases based on fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
in july  we completed a registered direct offering of  units  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants represent the right to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and are exercisable between january  and july  these warrants are discussed above in the explanatory note restatement of consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we account for the warrants as a derivative instrument  and changes in the fair value of the warrants are included under other income expense in the company s statements of operations for each reporting period 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the warrant liability included in the company s consolidated balance sheet was million 
we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the warrants 
as a result  the valuation of this derivative instrument is subjective  and the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and probability of a fundamental transaction 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we could  at any point in time  ultimately incur amounts significantly different than the carrying value 
there are outstanding loans owed by certain of our former directors which may not be repaid 
two of our former directors have outstanding promissory notes due to the company 
the promissory notes were initially delivered by the former directors to us in march as payment of the exercise price of certain of their individual stock options 
as security  the former directors pledged shares of our common stock as collateral 
as of december   the outstanding principal and interest for these two promissory notes was million 
both promissory notes are currently in default 

table of contents we are uncertain about the ultimate collectability of these promissory notes 
at our current market prices  we do not expect to recover the full amount outstanding under either promissory note upon a sale of the pledged shares alone 
we have initiated law suits to collect under both of these promissory notes  however litigation is uncertain and potentially expensive 
even with a successful verdict  there are no assurances that the former directors will be able to repay the promissory notes in full 
raising additional capital by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates 
if we are unable to partner with a third party to advance the development of one or more of our vaccine candidates  we will need to raise money through additional debt or equity financings 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience immediate dilution which may be significant 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that may not be favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
in addition  current economic conditions may also negatively affect the desire or ability of potential collaborators to enter into transactions with us 
they may also have to delay or cancel research and development projects or reduce their overall budgets 
product development risks because our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful 
our vaccine work depends on new  rapidly evolving technologies and on the marketability and profitability of our products 
commercialization of our vaccine products could fail for a variety of reasons  and include the possibility that our vlp technology  any or all of the products based on vlp technology or our proprietary manufacturing process will be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances or commercial viability  we are unable to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in a cost effective manner  the products  if safe and effective  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or uneconomical to market  our pilot plant manufacturing facility will fail to continue to pass regulatory inspections  proprietary rights of third parties will prevent us or our collaborators from exploiting technologies  manufacturing or marketing products  and third party competitors will gain greater market share due to superior products or marketing capabilities 
we have not completed the development of vaccine products and we may not succeed in obtaining the fda approval necessary to sell additional products 
the development  manufacture and marketing of our pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to government regulation in the united states and other countries 
in the united states and most foreign countries  we must complete rigorous pre clinical testing and extensive clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product 
none of our vaccine products have yet gained regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere 
we also have product candidates in clinical trials and pre clinical laboratory or animal studies 
the steps required by the fda before our proposed investigational products may be marketed in the united states include performance of pre clinical animal and laboratory tests  
table of contents submissions to the fda of an ind which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product in the intended target population  performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process intended for commercial use  including appropriate manufacturing data and regulatory inspections  submission to the fda of a bla or a nda  and fda approval of the bla or nda before any commercial sale or shipment of the product 
the processes are expensive and can take many years to complete  and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities 
the start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons  many of which are out of our control 
safety concerns may emerge that could lengthen the ongoing trials or require additional trials to be conducted 
regulatory authorities may also require additional testing  and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies  which we may be unable to do without conducting further clinical trials 
moreover  if the fda or foreign regulatory body grants regulatory approval of a product  the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution 
expanded or additional indications for approved products may not be approved  which could limit our revenue 
foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval 
consequently  even if we believe that pre clinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our product candidates  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction 
if our vaccine candidates are not approved  our ability to generate revenue will be limited and our business will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to manufacture our vaccines in sufficient quantities  at sufficient yields or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for our vaccines  we may experience delays in product development  clinical trials  regulatory approval and commercial distribution 
completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine product candidates require access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture our product candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial scale 
we have limited experience manufacturing any of our product candidates in the volumes that will be necessary to support large scale clinical trials or commercial sales 
efforts to establish capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling  scale up  reproducibility  yield  purity  cost  potency or quality 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical quantities or  when necessary  in commercial quantities and at sufficient yields  then we must rely on third parties 
other third party manufacturers must also receive fda approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial products 
our vaccines may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority 
we may not be able to enter into any necessary third party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms  or on a timely basis 
in addition  we have to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know how with the third party manufacturers  which can be time consuming and may result in delays 
influenza vaccines are intensely seasonal in nature 
if a vaccine is not available early enough in the influenza season  we would likely have difficulty selling the vaccine 
further  pandemic outbreaks present only short term opportunities for the company 
there is no way to predict when there will be a pandemic outbreak  the strain of the influenza or how long the pandemic will last 
for these reasons  any delay in the delivery of an influenza vaccine could result in lower sales volumes  lower sale prices  or no sales 
because the strain of the seasonal influenza changes annually  inventory of seasonal vaccine cannot be sold during a subsequent influenza season 
any delay in the manufacture of our influenza vaccines could adversely affect our ability to sell the vaccines 

table of contents our reliance on contract manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control 
because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third party manufacturers with the expertise  required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial scale  replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine 
a third party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production 
these problems may include difficulties with production costs  scale up and yields  availability of raw materials and supplies  quality control and assurance  shortages of qualified personnel  compliance with strictly enforced federal  state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where product might be sold  and lack of capital funding 
as a result  any delay or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our vaccine products may contain adventitious agents 
because our vaccines are produced in animal cell substrates  there are risks that infectious diseases that are unique to the animal substrates can be transmitted to human recipients 
the fda seeks to ensure that vaccine products do not contain adventitious agents or  if they do  that such adventitious agents create a benefit to the vaccine and are not harmful to the recipient 
identifying that adventitious agents in vaccines are not present or  if they are present  that they are not harmful is potentially difficult and expensive 
even with significant testing  we may not be able to demonstrate to the fda that our vaccines are either free of adventitious agents or that any adventitious agents that do occur are beneficial to the vaccine and harmless to the recipient 
we must identify products and product candidates for development with our vlp technology and establish successful third party relationships 
the near and long term viability of our vaccine product candidates will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  non profit organizations and government agencies 
establishing strategic collaborations and obtaining government funding is difficult and time consuming 
potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial  regulatory or intellectual property position or based on their internal pipeline  government agencies may reject contract or grant applications based on their assessment of public need  the public interest  our products ability to address these areas  or other reasons beyond our expectations or control 
if we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations or government relationships on acceptable terms  we may not be able to commercialize our vaccine product candidates or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts 
even if we establish new collaborations or obtain government funding  these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any vaccine product candidates for several reasons  including the fact that we may not have the ability to control the activities of our partner and cannot provide assurance that they will fulfill their obligations to us  including with respect to the license  development and commercialization of products and product candidates  in a timely manner or at all  such partners may not devote sufficient resources to our products and product candidates or properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights  
table of contents any failure on the part of our partners to perform or satisfy their obligations to us could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates  and affect our ability to realize product revenue  and disagreements  including disputes over the ownership of technology developed with such collaborators  could result in litigation  which would be time consuming and expensive  and may delay or terminate research and development efforts  regulatory approvals  and commercialization activities 
our collaborators will be subject to the same regulatory approval of their manufacturing facility and process as novavax 
before we could begin commercial manufacturing of any of our product candidates  we and our collaborators must pass a pre approval inspection before fda approval and comply with the fda s cgmp 
if our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements  our product candidates would not be approved 
if our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements after approval  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products 
if we or our partners fail to maintain our existing agreements or in the event we fail to establish agreements as necessary  we could be required to undertake research  development manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense 
these activities would significantly increase our capital requirements and  given our lack of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  significantly delay the commercialization of products and product candidates 
because we depend on third parties to conduct some of our laboratory testing  clinical trials  and manufacturing  we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop products 
we are dependent on third party research organizations to conduct some of our laboratory testing  clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary services on acceptable terms  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties 
these third parties may not complete testing or manufacturing activities on schedule  within budget  or when we request 
we may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our laboratory testing  clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
we have not manufactured any of our product candidates at a commercial level and may need to identify additional third party manufacturers to scale up and manufacture our products 
we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol 
moreover  the fda and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards  commonly referred to as good clinical practices  for conducting  recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected 
the fda and foreign regulatory agencies also require us to comply with good manufacturing practices 
our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements 
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines  if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised or the product they manufacture is contaminated due to the failure to adhere to our clinical and manufacturing protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons  our pre clinical development activities of clinical trials may be extended  delayed  suspended or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of  or commercially manufacture  our product candidates 
our collaborations may not be profitable 
we have entered into a co marketing agreement with gehc for a pandemic influenza vaccine solution for select international countries 
the collaboration incorporates gehc s bioprocess solutions and design expertise with novavax s vlp manufacturing platform 
we have formed a joint venture with cadila in india 
in connection with this joint venture  we agreed to a master services agreement under which we currently are obligated to purchase million of services from cadila or pay cadila all or a portion of the shortfall before march we have entered into a license agreement with lgls that allows them to use our 
table of contents manufacturing and production technology to develop and sell our influenza vaccines 
we cannot predict when  if at all  these relationships will lead to approved products  sales  or otherwise provide revenue to the company or become profitable 
we have limited marketing capabilities  and if we are unable to enter into collaborations with marketing partners or develop our own sales and marketing capability  we may not be successful in commercializing any approved products 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
as a result  we will depend on collaborations with third parties that have established distribution systems and sales forces 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our revenue will depend upon the efforts of third parties  over which we may have little or no control 
if we are unable to reach and maintain agreements with one or more pharmaceutical companies or collaborators  we may be required to market our products directly 
developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay a product launch 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel or otherwise develop this capability 
our product candidates may never achieve market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approvals 
even if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates  the commercial success of these product candidates will depend on  among other things  their acceptance by physicians  patients  third party payers such as health insurance companies and other members of the medical community as a vaccine and cost effective alternative to competing products 
if our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance  we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business 
market acceptance of  and demand for  any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors  including our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy  the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  whether our vaccines are differentiated from other vaccines based on immunogenicity  availability  relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments  the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution strategy  publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments  and our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement 
in particular  there are significant challenges to market acceptance for seasonal influenza vaccines 
for our seasonal vaccine to be accepted in the market  we must demonstrate differentiation from other seasonal vaccines that are currently approved and marketed 
this can mean that the vaccine is more effective in certain populations  such as the elderly  or cheaper and quicker to produce 
there are no assurances that our vaccine will be more efficacious than other vaccines 
if our product candidates do not become widely accepted by physicians  patients  third party payers and other members of the medical community  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if reforms in the health care industry make reimbursement for our potential products less likely  the market for our potential products will be reduced  and we could lose potential sources of revenue 
our success may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of vaccines will be available from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs and other organizations 
over the past decade  the cost of health care has risen significantly  and there have been numerous proposals by legislators  regulators and third party health care payers to curb these costs 
some of these proposals have involved limitations on the amount of reimbursement for certain products 
similar federal or state health care legislation may be adopted in the future and any products that we or our collaborators seek to commercialize may not be considered cost effective 
adequate 
table of contents third party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
moreover  the existence or threat of cost control measures could cause our corporate collaborators to be less willing or able to pursue research and development programs related to our product candidates 
regulatory risks we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis or comply with our continuing regulatory obligations after approval is obtained 
delays in obtaining regulatory approval can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities  losing any potential marketing advantage of being early to market and increased trial costs 
the speed with which we begin and complete our pre clinical studies necessary to begin clinical trials  clinical trials and our applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors  including the following our ability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in necessary pre clinical studies and clinical trials  prior regulatory agency review and approval  institutional review board approval of the protocol and the informed consent form  the rate of subject or patient enrollment and retention  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the subject or patient population  the proximity of subjects and patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial and the nature of the protocol  negative test results or side effects experienced by trial participants  analysis of data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities  which are susceptible to varying interpretations and which interpretations could delay  limit or prevent further studies or regulatory approval  the availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical trials and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications  and changes in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug or vaccine approval during the period of product development 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory marketing approvals 
we may not be permitted to continue or commence additional clinical trials 
we also face the risk that the results of our clinical trials may be inconsistent with the results obtained in pre clinical studies or clinical trials of similar products  or that the results obtained in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases 
a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical and product development industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in early animal and human testing 
regulatory agencies may require us or our collaborators to delay  restrict or discontinue clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
in addition  we or our collaborators may be unable to submit applications to regulatory agencies within the time frame we currently expect 
once submitted  applications must be approved by various regulatory agencies before we or our collaborators can commercialize the product described in the application 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of such clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical trials could delay our ability to generate revenue and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally 
we intend to have our product candidates marketed outside the united states 
in furtherance of this objective  we have entered into relationships with cadila in india and lgls in south korea 
in order to market our products in the european union  india  asia and many other non united states jurisdictions  we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements 

table of contents the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and data review 
the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by a regulatory agency  such as the fda  does not ensure approval by any other regulatory agencies  for example in other foreign countries 
however  a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions  including approval by the fda 
the failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could harm our business 
even if regulatory approval is received for our product candidates  the later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
even if a product gains regulatory approval  such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed  and the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review  including adverse event reporting requirements and the fda s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved uses 
failure to comply with any post approval requirements can  among other things  result in warning letters  product seizures  recalls  substantial fines  injunctions  suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
any of these enforcement actions  any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements  or any safety issues that arise with any approved products  could adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenue and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business 
we also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product  even after obtaining product approval  if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory approval 
with the use of any vaccine by a wide patient population  serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the vaccine itself  and only if the specific event occurs with some regularity over a period of time does the vaccine become suspect as having a causal relationship to the adverse event 
any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products  possibly subject us to substantial liabilities  and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition 
because we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  we may be unable to conduct our business in the most advantageous manner 
we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals  emissions and wastewater discharges  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research  including infectious disease agents 
we also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action 
any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations 
our facility in maryland is subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including chemicals  microorganisms and various hazardous compounds used in connection with our research and development activities 
in the united states  these laws include the occupational safety and health act  the toxic test substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials 
federal  state  and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  these hazardous materials 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 

table of contents although we have general liability insurance  these policies contain exclusions from insurance against claims arising from pollution from chemical or pollution from conditions arising from our operations 
our collaborators are working with these types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  any hazardous materials 
however  we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and occupational health and safety regulations 
intellectual property risks our success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
our success in large part depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets 
to do so  we must prosecute and maintain existing patents  obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection 
we also must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or allowing third parties to infringe our rights 
we currently have or have rights to over united states patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering our technologies 
however  patent issues relating to pharmaceuticals and biologics involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of biotechnology patent claims that are granted by the united states patent and trademark office or enforced by the federal courts 
therefore  we do not know whether our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantage 
we also cannot be sure that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
furthermore  there is a risk that others will independently develop or duplicate similar technology or products or circumvent the patents issued to us 
there is a risk that third parties may challenge our existing patents or claim that we are infringing their patents or proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending patent infringement suits or in filing suits against others to have their patents declared invalid or claim infringement 
it is also possible that we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties to avoid infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that such third party licenses would be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required third party licenses  we may be delayed in or prohibited from developing  manufacturing or selling products requiring such licenses 
although our patent filings include claims covering various features of our products and product candidates  including composition  methods of manufacture and use  our patents do not provide us with complete protection against the development of competing products 
some of our know how and technology is not patentable 
to protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we infringe or are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  it will adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our research  development and commercialization activities  including any product candidates or products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents owned by third parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
there may be rights we are not aware of  including applications that have been filed but not published that  when issued  could be asserted against us 
these third parties could bring claims against us  and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we are able to obtain a license  the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both  and the rights granted to us might be non exclusive  which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  if  as a result of actual or threatened patent 
table of contents infringement claims  we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
all of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators  which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors 
as a result  we may be required to file infringement claims to counter infringement for unauthorized use 
this can be expensive  particularly for a company of our size  and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at the risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management 
we may not be able  alone or with our collaborators and licensors  to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if investors perceive these results to be negative  the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed 
we may need to license intellectual property from third parties and  if our right to use the intellectual property we license is affected  our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates may be harmed 
we expect that we will need to license intellectual property from third parties in the future and that these licenses will be material to our business 
we will not own the patents or patent applications that underlie these licenses  and we will not control the enforcement of the patents 
we will rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and file those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents 
our license agreement with wyeth  which gives us rights to a family of patent applications covering vlp technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields of use  is non exclusive 
these applications are very significant to our business 
if each milestone is achieved for any particular product candidate  we would be obligated to pay an aggregate of million to wyeth for each product candidate developed and commercialized under the agreement 
achievement of each milestone is subject to many risks  including those described in these risk factors 
annual license maintenance fees under the wyeth agreement aggregate to million per year 
our license with umms gives us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize vaccines incorporating certain virus like particles for use in human vaccines 
while many of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with rights in specified fields  the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third parties 
in addition  our rights to use these technologies and practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating

any of our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of a term or condition of the license agreement  or in certain other circumstances 
our product candidates and potential product candidates will require several components that may each be the subject of a license agreement 
the cumulative license fees and royalties for these components may make the commercialization of these product candidates uneconomical 
if patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change  our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize our discoveries 
important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the united states and other important markets outside the united states  such as europe and japan 
foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the united states patent system 
we expect that litigation or administrative proceedings will likely be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others proprietary rights 
any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may be time consuming or impossible to do 
in addition  changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products 
we cannot provide assurance that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many emerging and biopharmaceutical companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be lower or more volatile than expected 
we have never paid dividends on our capital stock  and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  delaware law  and our shareholder rights plan could delay or prevent the acquisition of the company  even if such acquisition would be beneficial to stockholders  and could impede changes in our board 
our organizational documents could hamper a third party s attempt to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of  the company 
we also have adopted a shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  that empowers our board to delay or negotiate  and thereby possibly thwart  any tender offer or takeover attempt the board opposes 
stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so 
these provisions also could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for our securities and make it more difficult to change the composition of our board in any one year 
these provisions include the right of the board to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of common stock without any further vote or action by stockholders  the existence of a staggered board with three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms and advance notice requirements for stockholders to nominate directors and make proposals 
the company also is afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless advance board or stockholder approval was obtained 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of director or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares

restatement of consolidated financial statements in july  we completed a registered direct offering of  units  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
the warrants represent the right to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and are exercisable between january  and july  the warrants do not explicitly preclude net cash settlement in the event registered shares are not available to satisfy exercise of the warrants 
in addition  the warrants include a provision whereby in certain fundamental transactions  which include a consolidation or merger with or into another corporation or the sale  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all our property  assets or business to another corporation  warrant holders would be entitled to require the company to purchase such warrant in exchange for a cash payment as determined in accordance with the warrant agreement 
the company previously recorded the fair value of the warrants in stockholders equity 
on december   we received a comment letter from the sec concerning its review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the comment letter specifically noted the treatment of the warrants as equity 
after further review  the company concluded that because the warrant agreements do not explicitly preclude net cash settlement in the event registered shares are not available to satisfy exercise of the warrants  the warrants should be classified as a liability  with changes in the fair value 
table of contents of the warrants reported in our statements of operations 
when we initially assessed the impact of reclassifying the warrants as a liability and marking the warrants to fair value at each reporting period  we utilized a black scholes option pricing model 
based upon discussions with the sec staff and further review of the warrant agreement  we determined that a more dynamic pricing model would be appropriate to estimate the fair value of the warrants because the warrants permit holders of such warrants to require the company to purchase the warrant from its holder in exchange for a cash payment in the event of a fundamental transaction 
because the monte carlo simulation model of estimating the fair value of our warrants can include a probability of a fundamental transaction occurring in valuing a warrant  we concluded that it would be the appropriate valuation methodology for the warrants 
as a result  on march   our audit committee determined that the previously issued consolidated financial statements included in our annual reports on form k for the years ended december  and and in our quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended march   june   september   march   june   september  and september  should not be relied upon  which we reported under a current report on form k filed on march  we have restated such financial statements in this annual report of form k for the year ended december  the adjustments made as a result of the restatement are more fully discussed in note restatement of consolidated financial statements in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the restatements reflect the recalculation of the estimated fair value of the warrants using a monte carlo simulation model  applying critical assumptions provided by management  including the possibility of a fundamental transaction occurring  reflecting conditions at each valuation date 
the company recomputed the estimated fair value of the warrants at the end of each quarterly reporting period using subjective input assumptions consistently applied for each period 
if the company were to alter its assumptions or the numbers input based on such assumptions  the resulting fair value estimate could be materially different 
the revaluation of the estimated fair value of the warrants at each subsequent balance sheet date results in a change in the carrying value of the liability  which is recorded as change in fair value of warrant liability in our consolidated statements of operations 
the net effect of these changes for the years ended december  and  and for each of the three months ended march   june   september   march   june   september   december   september  and december  are as follows

overview novavax  inc  a delaware corporation novavax  the company  we  or us  was incorporated in  and is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel  highly potent recombinant vaccines 
these vaccines leverage our virus like particle vlp platform technology coupled with a single use bioprocessing production system 
vlps are genetically engineered three dimensional nanostructures that incorporate immunologically important lipids and recombinant proteins 
our vlps resemble the virus they were engineered to mimic  but lack the genetic material to replicate the virus 
our single use bioprocessing production technology uses insect cells rather than chicken eggs or mammalian cells 
our current product targets include vaccines against pandemic and seasonal influenza  including the hn and hn pandemic strains  and respiratory syncytial virus rsv 
cpl biologicals private limited the jv  our joint venture formed in between us and cadila pharmaceuticals ltd  a private company incorporated under the laws of india cadila  is owned by cadila and is owned by us 
the jv will develop and manufacture our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates and cadila s biogeneric products and other diagnostic products for the territory of india 
in june  the jv opened its newly constructed state of the art manufacturing facility  funded by cadila  to be used to produce our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines 
because we do not control the jv  we account for our investment using the equity method 
since the carrying value of our contribution was nominal and there is no guarantee or commitment to provide future funding  we have not recorded nor do we expect to record losses related to this investment in the future 
a current summary of our significant research and development programs and status of development follows

program development phase pandemic influenza hn phase ii ended pandemic influenza hn phase ii seasonal influenza phase ii respiratory syncytial virus rsv phase i pandemic influenza hn in  we completed our clinical trial of our hn influenza vlp vaccine in mexico in collaboration with laboratorio avi mex sa de cv and ge healthcare 
this randomized  blinded  placebo controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of our hn influenza vlp vaccine in healthy adults 
we initially completed enrollment of stage one and reported positive results on the vaccine s safety and immunogenicity in the first  subjects 
we initiated stage two of the trial to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in a larger cohort and completed enrollment of more than  subjects 
the month safety evaluation of the subjects in the second stage of the clinical trial was completed in september  and no vaccine related serious adverse events were reported 
the positive final results of this trial were presented in february at the th world health organization meeting on evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in clinical trials 
these results are expected to support development of our hn pandemic and seasonal influenza vlp vaccines in other countries  including the united states 
pandemic influenza hn in  we released results from a pre clinical study in which ferrets that received our hn vaccine candidate were protected from a lethal challenge of the hn virus 
after filing an investigational new drug ind application  we initiated a phase i iia clinical trial 
we released interim data from the first portion of this clinical trial in december these interim results demonstrated that our pandemic influenza vaccine 
table of contents can generate a protective immune response 
we conducted the second portion of the phase i iia trial in to gather additional subject immunogenicity and safety data and determine a final dose through the completion of this clinical trial 
in august  we reported favorable results from this clinical trial  which demonstrated strong neutralizing antibody titers across all three doses tested 
a final clinical study report was completed and the vaccine was well tolerated at all dosages as compared with the placebo 
no serious adverse events were reported 
in february  we announced that the vaccine induced robust hemagglutination inhibition hai responses  which have been shown to be important for protection against influenza disease 
seasonal influenza in april  we reported the final results of our phase ii trial in older adults years or higher in age in a dose ranging study comparing our trivalent seasonal influenza vlp vaccine with a commercially available inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine tiv 
the results showed that the vaccine was both safe and immunogenic against the seasonal influenza virus strains in older adults 
the center for disease control and prevention cdc has indicated that currently approved seasonal influenza vaccines have shown to be only to effective in preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza in older adults  however  we believe that our trivalent seasonal influenza vlp vaccine has the potential to address this unmet medical need 
in march  we released final results of the phase ii trial in healthy adults to years in age immunized with our trivalent seasonal influenza vlp vaccine 
the results showed the vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic 
respiratory syncytial virus rsv our rsv vaccine candidate has completed a pre clinical safety and efficacy study in cotton rats  the results of which were used to support an ind application that we filed with the fda in september we addressed a specific question from the fda around our chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc that caused the agency to put our planned phase i trial on temporary clinical hold  and in december  the temporary clinical hold was lifted 
in december  we began patient enrollment in our phase i clinical trial to assess the safety  immunogenicity and tolerability of our rsv vaccine candidate 
this blinded  placebo controlled  escalating dose study of healthy adults to years in age will be tested in a total of subjects 
summary of significant transactions in and first quarter of hhs barda contract award for recombinant influenza vaccines in september  we responded to the hhs barda request for proposal rfp for a potential contract award for the advanced development of recombinant influenza vaccines 
in april  we were notified by hhs barda that our proposal was within the competitive range for award consideration 
on september   at the request of hhs barda  we submitted final technical and business proposal revisions to the rfp 
in february  we were awarded a contract from hhs barda valued at million for the first month base period  with an hhs barda option for an additional period of months valued at million  for a total contract value of up to million 
the hhs barda contract award provides significant funding for our continued ongoing clinical development and product scale up of our seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates 
this is a cost plus fixed fee reimbursement contract in which hhs barda will reimburse us for direct contract costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs and a fee earned in the further development of our seasonal and pandemic hn influenza vaccines 
billings under the contract will be based on approved provisional indirect billing rates  which permit recovery of fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses not exceeding certain limits 
these indirect rates will be subject to review by hhs barda s auditor on an annual basis 
when the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made  revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly 
license agreement with lg life sciences  ltd 
in february  we entered into a licensing agreement with lg life sciences  ltd 
lgls that allows lgls to use our vlp technology to develop and commercially sell our influenza vaccines in south korea and certain other emerging market countries 
lgls received an exclusive license to our influenza vlp technology in south korea and a non exclusive license in the other specified countries 
at its own cost  lgls is 
table of contents responsible for funding its clinical development of the influenza vlp vaccines and completing a manufacturing facility in south korea 
we will receive i a guaranteed upfront payment  ii potential milestone payments and iii double digit royalty payments from lgls s future commercial sales of influenza vlp vaccines 
at the market sales issuances in march  we terminated previous at the market sales agreements with wm smith co 
and entered into an at the market sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc mlv  as sales agent  under which we could sell an aggregate of million in gross proceeds of our common stock 
our board of directors has authorized the sale of up to million shares of our common stock pursuant to the at the market sales agreement 
during  we sold  shares of our common stock at a range of and received net proceeds of approximately million under the at the market sales agreement 
therapeutic tax credit in july  we submitted applications for qualifying therapeutic discovery project credits under d of the internal revenue code  as amended the code  as added to the code by section a of the patient protection and affordable care act of in october  we were awarded grants totaling approximately million related to our applications  of which million was received in the remainder of such grants could be received in rovi pharmaceuticals of spain rovi in february  we terminated negotiations on a licensing arrangement with rovi 
the decision to terminate negotiations was made because of our inability to agree on acceptable terms of the proposed collaboration and to obtain the necessary funding commitment for the program 
as a result  we are free to seek a new partner for our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine development efforts in europe 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to accounting for the valuation of our short term investments  stock based compensation  long lived assets  goodwill  and valuation of our warrants and net deferred tax assets have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
short term investments our short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities  if determined to be temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we assess the recoverability of our short term investments and  if an impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
other than temporary impairments are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we invested in auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us from liquidating certain holdings of auction rate securities as the amount of securities submitted for sale during the auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
although an event of an auction failure does not necessarily mean that a security is impaired  we consider various factors to assess the fair value and the classification of the securities as short term 
table of contents investments 
fair value was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation firm using two valuation methods a discounted cash flow method and a market comparable method 
certain factors used in these methods include  but are not necessarily limited to  comparable securities traded on secondary markets  timing of the failed auction  specific security auction history  quality of underlying collateral  rating of the security and the bond insurer  our ability and intent to retain the securities for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in the market value and other factors 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to these securities in  which was partially offset by realized gains of million relating to redemptions of several auction rate securities 
since that time  changes in the fair value of our auction rate securities have been included in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we have recorded million in unrealized gains on the auction rate securities held by us at year end 
the remainder of our short term investments are corporate debt securities with maturities of one year or less 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected term of the award 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look back period corresponding to the expected life 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting exercise and forfeiture history 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
also  the accounting estimate of stock based compensation expense is reasonably likely to change from period to period as further stock options are granted and adjustments are made for stock option cancellations 
impairments of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets by performing a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 

table of contents goodwill goodwill originally resulted from a business acquisition in assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
we utilize the market approach and  if considered necessary  the income approach to determine if we have an impairment of our goodwill 
the market approach serves as the primary approach and is based on market value of invested capital 
the concluded fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of our goodwill at december  and the income approach is used as a confirming look to the market approach 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we perform the required annual impairment test in our fourth quarter of each year 
given the current economic conditions and the uncertainties regarding their impact on us  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future  or that any change in the assumptions or the current economic conditions will not trigger more frequently than on an annual basis 
if our assumptions are not achieved or economic conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
warrant accounting we account for warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in asc  derivatives and hedging  as derivative liabilities 
as such  warrants have been classified as a non current liability in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in compliance with applicable accounting standards  registered warrants that require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to cash settlement are accounted for as derivative liabilities 
we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the warrants 
as a result  the valuation of warrants is subjective  and the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and probability of a fundamental transaction 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we could  at any point in time  ultimately incur amounts significantly different than the carrying value 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax position requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  the applicable statute of limitations  and potential limitations on available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 

table of contents a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in september  asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  was issued and changed the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the impact of asu on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the nature and terms of our revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
however  based on our current customer arrangements  we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends topic to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to level measurements 
asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the asu was effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except for the requirements to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of level activity will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  was issued and will amend the accounting for revenue arrangements under which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations to a customer over a period of time  when the deliverable or unit of accounting is not within the scope of other authoritative literature and when the arrangement consideration is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone 
the amendment defines a milestone and clarifies whether an entity may recognize consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this amendment is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved on or after january   with early adoption permitted 
the amendment may be applied retrospectively to all arrangements or prospectively for milestones achieved after the effective date 
we expect to prospectively apply the amended guidance to milestones achieved on or after january  the new guidance is consistent with our current revenue recognition policies for arrangements with milestones 
as a result  we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for fiscal years  and amounts in tables are presented in thousands  except per share information the following is a discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations of novavax  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in this annual report on form k

our outside testing costs increased by million  which was partially offset by a decrease in facility costs of million related to the exiting of our taft court facility in we track our research and development expenses by the type of costs incurred in identifying  developing  manufacturing and testing vaccine candidates 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area and therefore believe that project by project information would not form a reasonable basis for disclosure to our investors 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs associated with contract research and manufacturing organizations  manufacturing supplies and outside animal and pre clinical testing 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development programs 
historically  we did not account for internal research and development expenses by project  since our employees work time is spread across multiple programs and our internal manufacturing clean room facility produces multiple vaccine candidates 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses by functional area for the year ended december  in millions

manufacturing vaccine discovery clinical regulatory affairs total research development expenses we do not provide forward looking estimates of costs and time to complete our research programs due to the many uncertainties associated with vaccine development 
as we obtain data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay trials in order to focus our resources on more promising vaccine candidates 
completion of trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary 
table of contents substantially depending upon the phase  size of trial  primary and secondary endpoints and the intended use of the vaccine candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  if trial locations are domestic  international or both  the time to enroll patients  the duration of treatment and follow up  the safety and efficacy profile of the vaccine candidate  and the cost and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  and to what extent  we will generate future cash flows from our research projects

table of contents liquidity matters and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and manufacturing costs 
we plan to continue to have multiple vaccines and products in various stages of development  and we believe our research and development  as well as general and administrative expenses and capital requirements will fluctuate depending upon the timing of certain events  such as the scope  initiation  rate and progress of our pre clinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development activities 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  the following table summarizes cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands

we purchased short term investments in to increase our rate of return on our investments 
capital expenditures for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the purchase of laboratory equipment relating to our production scale up 
for  we expect our level of capital expenditures to increase in connection with the work to be performed under the hhs barda contract 
the decrease in our financing activities consists primarily of lower sales of our common stock 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our common stock through our at the market sales agreement 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our common stock through our at the market sales agreement  a public offering and sales to cadila and rovi  partially offset by the repayment of our convertible notes of million 
we have entered into agreements with outside providers to support our clinical development 
as of december   million remains unpaid on certain of these agreements in the event our outside providers complete their services in however  under the terms of the agreements  we have the option to terminate  but we would be obligated to pay the provider for all costs incurred through the effective date of termination 
we have licensed certain rights from wyeth and umms 
the wyeth license  which provides for an upfront payment  annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales  is a non exclusive  worldwide license to a family of patent applications covering vlp technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields of use  the license may be terminated by wyeth only for cause and may be terminated by us only after we have provided ninety days notice that we have absolutely and finally ceased activity  including through any affiliate or sublicense  related to the manufacturing  development  marketing or sale of products covered by the license 
in may  we amended the license  effective as of march   under which the parties agreed that we would not be obligated to make a milestone payment 
table of contents in the event our hn pandemic vaccine candidate received regulatory approval in the country of mexico  provided that we increase certain subsequent milestone payments 
payments under the agreement to wyeth from through aggregated million 
we do not expect to make a milestone payment to wyeth in the next twelve months 
the umms license  which provides for milestone payments and royalties on product sales  is an exclusive worldwide license of vlp technology to develop vlp vaccines for the prevention of any viral diseases in humans 
as of december   our payments made to umms in the aggregate are not material 
also  we believe that all payments under the umms agreement will not be material in the next twelve months 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as of december   anticipated revenue under the hhs barda contract awarded in february  anticipated proceeds from the sales of our common stock under our at the market sales agreement and our current business operations  we believe we will have adequate capital resources available to operate at planned levels for at least the next twelve months 
additional capital will be required in the future to develop our product candidates through clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization 
our ability to generate revenue under the hhs barda contract and raise funds under our at the market sales agreement is subject to our business performance and market conditions 
further we will seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  non dilutive government contracts  collaborative arrangements  or some combination of these financing alternatives 
any capital raised by an equity offering will likely be substantially dilutive to the existing stockholders and any licensing or development arrangement may require us to give up rights to a product or technology at less than its full potential value 
other than our at the market sales agreement with mlv  we have not secured any additional commitments for new financing nor can we provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to perform under the hhs barda contract and obtain additional capital  we will assess our capital resources and will likely be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our organization  or reduce our general and administrative infrastructure

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and working capital of million 
our exposure to market risk is primarily confined to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our short term investments were classified as available for sale 
we do not believe that a change in the market rates of interest would have any significant impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on our investments when they mature and the proceeds are reinvested into new investments and  therefore  could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we had previously invested in auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
short term investments at december  include investments in three auction rate securities with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million and million related to these securities in and respectively  which was partially offset by realized gains of million in relating to redemptions of several auction rate securities 
at december   we have recorded million in unrealized gains on the auction rate securities included in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
these investments are classified within current assets because we may need to liquidate these securities within the next year to fund our ongoing operations 
interest and dividend income is recorded when earned and included in interest income 
premiums and discounts  if any  on short term investments are amortized or accreted to maturity and included in interest income 
the specific identification method is used in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of our securities 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct the vast majority of our business activities 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we do not have material debt and  as such  do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of our borrowing activities
