item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition  operating results  earnings or stock price  in various ways 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the aidc industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success depends upon the frequent enhancement of existing products and timely introduction of new products that meet our customers needs 
customer requirements for aidc products are rapidly evolving and technological changes in our industry occur rapidly 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products 
enhancing existing products and developing new products is a complex and uncertain process 
it often requires significant investments in research and development r d 
we may not have adequate resources to invest in r d that will keep pace with technological changes in our industry 
even if we made adequate investme nts in r d  they may not result in products attractive or acceptable to our customers 
furthermore  we may not be able to launch new or improved products before our competition launches comparable products 
any of these factors could cause our business or financial results to suffer 
introduction of new products could render our existing products obsolete  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
rapid technological change  whether through our own or our competitors introduction of new products or technologies  could render our products obsolete 
this may reduce sales volumes  or it may result in substantial excess or obsolete inventories  or both 
in such event  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory at a substantial discount to the planned resale price or the cost of making or acquiring that inventory and write off the difference 
if we are unable to anticipate the obsolescence of our products or do not mitigate the risk of product obsolescence  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and more profitable than we are  which may give them a competitive advantage 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
recent consolidation in the aidc industry has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
some of these competitors have substantially more revenue or profit than we do 
this may allow them to invest more in r d  sales and marketing  and customer support than we can or to achieve more efficient economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution 
it may also allow them to acquire or make complementary products that alone or in combination with other aidc products could afford them a competitive advantage 
these advantages may enable our larger competitors to weather market down turns longer or adapt more quickly to emerging technology developments  market trends or price declines than we can 
those competitors may also be able to precipitate such market changes by introducing new technologies  reducing their prices or otherwise changing their activities 
this competition may also require us to reduce our prices  thereby lowering our margins 
there is no assurance that our strategies to counteract our competitors advantages will successfully offset all or a portion of this scale imbalance 
our efforts to counteract this scale imbalance may result in the reduction of revenue or an increase in costs  which could materially and adversely affect our earnings 
in addition  if we are unable to offset all or a significant portion of this imbalance  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
further consolidation of the aidc industry through business combination  strategic alliances and similar transactions could intensify competition and create other risks for our business 
our industry could experience a new series of acquisitions  joint ventures  strategic alliances or private equity transactions 
these events could alter the structure of the aidc industry and intensify competition within our industry by expanding the presence of companies that have greater business and financial resources than the firms they acquired or by increasing the market share of some companies in our industry 
such increased competition could have material adverse impacts to our market share  revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any of the strategies that we employ to respond to the structural changes and related increased competition will be successful 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses  patents  technologies  products or services  and our failure to do so successfully may adversely affect our competitive position or financial results 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or investments to expand our suite of products and services 
our growth could be hampered if we are unable to identify suitable acquisitions and investments or agree on the terms of any such acquisition or investment 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction if we lack sufficient resources to finance the transaction on our own and cannot obtain financing at a reasonable cost 
if we are not able to complete such acquisitions and successfully integr ate them  or to complete investments and successfully realize the intended benefits of them  our competitive position may suffer  which could have adverse impacts on our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
in addition to the customary risks of business combinations  our pending acquisition of vocollect  inc presents specific risks for our business 
there are numerous factors that may affect the success of our acquisition of vocollect  some of which are outlined in the next risk factor 
in addition  the success of that acquisition will depend on our ability to leverage the vocollect products to enable us to expand our position in the warehouse market and our ability to successfully integrate and market the vocollect products 
if we are unable to achieve those goals  we may not realize all of the benefits anticipated or intended from the vocollect acquisition 
item a 
risk factors continued our acquisition of vocollect and other business combinations and acquisition transactions may not succeed in generating the intended benefits and  may  therefore  adversely affect shareholder value or our financial results 
integration of new businesses or technologies into our business may have any of the following adverse effects we may have difficulty transitioning customers and other business relationships to intermec 
we may have problems unifying management following a transaction 
we may lose key employees from our existing or acquired businesses 
we may experience intensified competition from other companies seeking to expand sales and market share during the integration period 
our management s attention may be diverted to the assimilation of the technology and personnel of acquired businesses or new product or service lines 
we may experience difficulties in coordinating geographically disparate organizations and corporate cultures and integrating management personnel with different business backgrounds 
the inability of our management to successfully integrate acquired businesses  and any related diversion of management s attention  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
business combinations and other acquisition transactions may have a direct adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  or on our stock price 
in order to complete such transactions  we may have to use cash  issue new equity securities with dilutive effects on existing stockholders  take on new debt  assume contingent liabilities or amortize assets or expenses in a manner that might have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet  results of operations or liquidity 
we are required to record certain acquisition related costs and other items as current period expenses  which would have the effect of reducing our reported earnings in the period in which an acquisition is consummated 
we are also required to record post closing goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges in the period i n which they occur  which could result in a significant charge to our earnings in that period 
these and other potential negative effects of an acquisition transaction could prevent us from realizing the benefits of such transactions and have a material adverse impact on our stock price  revenues  revenue growth  balance sheet  results of operations and liquidity 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to improve our business processes and systems and transform our supply chain or if those efforts have unintended results 
in order to increase sales and profits  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in ways that are cost effective and efficient from an operational and a tax perspective 
to achieve our objectives  we are continuing to streamline our sales systems  supply chain and business processes and to implement a new global enterprise resource planning erp system 
we have also established an international headquarters in singapore 
these restructurings are large  complex undertakings and may result in unanticipated costs  liabilities and operational disruptions  or tax or other financial consequences 
they might not proceed as planned  could result in unintended consequences or might not accomplish the intended goals  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our sales  profits  results of operations and earnings 
macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products  reduced profitability or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable 
domestic and international economic  political and social conditions are uncertain due to a variety of factors  including global  regional and national economic downturns  the availability and cost of credit  volatility in stock and credit markets  energy costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the risk of global conflict  the risk of terrorism  political turmoil  or war in a given country or region  and public health issues 
our business depends on our customers demand for our products and services  the general economic health of current and prospective customers  and their desire or ability to make investments in technology 
a deterioration of global  regional or local political  economic or social conditions could affect potential customers in ways that reduce demand for our products and disrupt our manufacturing and sales plans and efforts 
these global  regional or local conditions may also cause governments to change their spending priorities  which may delay  reduce or eliminate funding for our products and services 
acts of terrorism  wars  public health issues and increased energy costs could disrupt commerce in ways that could impair our supply chain an d our ability to get products to our customers and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political  economic or social conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors we face risks as a global company that could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we face risks that companies operating in a single country or region do not have 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries 
our sales could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  security requirements  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in a particular country or region could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our assets at risk 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand sales of our products in any market  and disruptions of our sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 
a significant percentage of our products and their components are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us from time to time  we contract with companies outside of the us to perform one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of domestic and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability and potentially weaker foreign ip protections may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex and can be expensive 
there is no a ssurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks in an efficient or cost effective manner  if at all 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are also subject to risks that our employees  contractors  representatives or agents could conduct our operations outside the us in ways that violate the us foreign corrupt practices act or other similar anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures to comply with those laws  our employees  contractors  representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies 
any such violations could have a negative impact on our business 
moreover  third party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services may violate our anti bribery policies and procedures  because it may be more difficult for us to oversee their conduct 
growth of and changes in our revenues and profits depend on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
fluctuations in our sales mix could have an adverse impact on or increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and profits 
sales of our products to large enterprises tend to have lower prices and gross margins than sales to smaller firms 
in addition  our gross margins vary depending on the product or service and the geographic region in which sales are made 
growth in our revenues and gross margins therefore depends on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
our introduction of lower priced products may also affect our ability to sell high end products  even if those products have a dvanced features 
in addition  our distributors  dealers and resellers can have a significant impact on the mix of our products and services 
if we are unable to execute a sales strategy that results in a favorable sales mix  our revenues  gross margins and earnings may decline 
further  changes in the mix of our sales from quarter to quarter or year to year may make our revenues  gross margins and earnings more volatile and difficult to predict 
our reliance on third party distributors could adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition to offering our products to certain customers and resellers directly  we rely to a significant and increasing degree on third party distributors and to sell our products to end users 
in and  one distributor  scansource  inc  accounted for more than of our sales  and it or other distributors may account for a substantial portion of our sales in the future 
changes in markets  customers or products  or negative developments in general economic and financial conditions and the availability of credit  may adversely affect the ability of these distributors to bring our products to market at the right time and in the right locations 
in addition  our competitors strategic relationships with or acquisitions of these distributors could disrupt our relationships with them 
any such disruption in the distribution of our products could impair or delay sales of our products to end users and increase our costs of distribution  which could adversely affect our sales or income 
we rely on third party contractors to design many of our products and their components and to manufacture substantially all of our current products 
any failure or inability of those third party contractors to provide high quality design and manufacturing services could adversely affect our business 
in relying on third party contractors to assemble substantially all of our products  we do not have direct physical control over the manufacturing process and operations 
this might adversely affect our ability to control the quality of our products and the timeliness of their delivery to our customers 
either of those potential consequences could adversely affect our customer rel ationships and our revenues 
furthermore  access to our intellectual property by contract manufacturers could possibly increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation of our assets 
we also use third party contractors to design certain products  parts and components 
if we are unable to engage design contractors that satisfy our requirements  or if such contractors fail to design products  parts and components to our specifications on time and at reasonable prices  our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new products would be impaired  and our business would suffer 
item a 
risk factors continued use of third party suppliers and service providers could adversely affect our product quality  delivery schedules or customer satisfaction  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
third party suppliers that we approve will be providing the components that our contract manufacturers will use in the final assembly of our products 
some of these components may be available only from a single source or limited sources  and if they become unavailable for any reason  we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis 
we also outsource a number of services to third party service providers  including transportation and logistics  management of spare parts and warranty service 
our products and services may be adversely affected by the quality cont rol of these third party suppliers and service providers  or by their inability to ship product  manage our product inventory  meet delivery deadlines or otherwise satisfy our customers needs 
failure of these third party suppliers and service providers in any of these respects may negatively affect our revenue and customer relationships 
furthermore  these suppliers and service providers may have access to our ip  which may increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation 
our inability to successfully defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
to protect our ip portfolio  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
ip infringement lawsuits are complex proceedings  and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in all or any of these cases or that we will achieve the desired outcome in terms of injunctive relief or damages or that the other parties will be able to pay the damages awarded 
adverse results in such lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and with our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
adverse outcomes in ip lawsuits could also reduce our royalty revenues 
in some periods  ip litig ation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods  increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse impact on our operating profits  results of operations or earnings 
since our business strategy includes global expansion  we are operating in developing countries where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing ip rights are very new or non existent and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with ip rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries  because we may not be able to enforce ip rights in those jurisdictions and alternative methods of protecting our ip rights may not be effective 
our inability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations 
our inability to successfully defend ourselves from the intellectual property infringement claims of others could have an adverse affect on the growth of our business and results of operations 
our competitors  our potential competitors and other companies may have ip rights covering products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their ip rights to prevent us from selling some of our products  to collect royalties from us  or to deter us from enforcing our ip rights against them 
those efforts may include infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
these lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any ip lawsuits initiated by third parties 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our custom ers  we could be enjoined from selling and our customers could be enjoined from using our products or services and ordered to pay for past damages 
we might also be required to pay future royalties or be forced to incur the cost of designing around the third party s ip 
in some periods  ip litigation expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods 
any of these events could increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues  operating profits  results of operations or earnings per share 
our failure to expand our ip portfolio could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
expansion of our ip portfolio is one of the available methods of growing our revenues and our profits 
this involves a complex and costly set of activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patents and other ip can be adversely affected by insufficient inventiveness of our employees  by changes in ip laws  treaties  and regulations  and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws treaties and regulations 
our ability to expand our ip portfolio could also be adversely affected by the lack of valuable ip for sale or license at affordable prices 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable ip in the jurisdictions where we and our competit ors operate or that we will be able to use or license that ip or that we will be able to generate meaningful royalty revenue or profits from our ip 
estimating our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
the computation of income tax expense benefit is complex because it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
income tax expense benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our global tax rate for the year  which includes forward looking financial projections 
such financial projections are based on numerous assumptions  including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction 
it is difficult to accurately forecast various items that make up the projections  and such items may be treated a s discrete accounting 
examples of items that could cause variability in our income tax rate include our mix of income by jurisdiction  tax deductions for stock option expense  the application of transfer pricing rules  tax audits and changes to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
future events  such as changes in our business and the tax law in the jurisdictions where we do business  could also affect our rate 
for these reasons  our global tax rate may be materially different than our estimate 
if we do not generate sufficient future taxable income  we may be required to recognize additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the value of our deferred tax assets depends  in part  on our ability to use them to offset taxable income in future years 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain other jurisdictions  or if there are significant changes in tax laws or the tax rates or the period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
such an increase would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and have a negative impact on our operating results 
if our estimated future taxable income is increased  the valuation allowances for deferred tax as sets may be reduced 
these changes may also contribute to the volatility of our financial results 
item a 
risk factors continued if we do not comply with agreements that we have made in certain jurisdictions  we may lose favorable tax treatment that results from those agreements 
in some jurisdictions in which we operate  favorable tax rates and other tax benefits are subject to our compliance with agreements that we have with relevant governmental agencies 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of those agreements  our tax rate in that jurisdiction might increase or we might lose certain tax benefits  which could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate or our financial results 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities examinations 
the irs and tax authorities in countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flows  revenue and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our international sales are quoted  billed and collected in the customer s local currency in emea and in us dollars elsewhere 
our product costs are largely denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our product margins are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the cost of goods and services that we purchase and personnel that we employ outside of the united states 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate changes by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
our currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
additionally  adverse movements in currency exchange rates could result in increases in our cost of goods sold or reduction in growth in international orders  materially impacting our cash flows and earnings 
global regulation and regulatory compliance  including environmental  technological and standards setting regulations  may limit our sales or increase our costs  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to domestic and international technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products 
such standards and regulations may also require us to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
we are also subject to self imposed standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epcglobal that provi de our customers with the ability to seamlessly use our products with products from other aidc vendors  which our customers demand 
changes in standards and regulations may be introduced at any time and with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country or region  increase our cost of supplying our products by requiring us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations  or require us to license our patents on a royalty free basis and prevent us from seeking damages and injunctive relief for patent infringements 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
due to these uncertainties and compliance burdens  our customers may postpone or cancel purchases of our products 
as a result  global regulation and compliance could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
competition for skilled employees is high in our industry  and we must remain competitive in terms of compensation and other employee benefits to retain key employees 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining skilled managers and employees  we will be unable to maintain and expand our business

item legal proceedings we currently  and from time to time  are involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings  including  but not limited to  ip  commercial  and employment matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
we do not expect the ultimate resolution of currently pending matters to be material in relation to our business  financial condition  and results of operations or liquidity

we also offer a variety of services related to our product offerings 
our advanced services include system design  deployment and activation 
we offer product and technology training as part of our education services 
managed services comprise remote device  network and asset management 
our repair services cover on site and depot equipment repair and our support services include on line and telephone technical support 
most of our revenue is cu rrently generated through sales of mobile computers  barcode scanners  printers and repair services 
our strategy is to provide rugged mobile business solutions that help our customers increase revenues  lower costs and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty 
as part of that strategy  we seek to strengthen our position as the solutions company in the aidc industry through vertical market expertise  a solutions orientation and customer and partner intimacy 
we also seek to grow our business by targeting the most attractive vertical markets  increasing our marketing activities  expanding our channel  adding software and managed services to our offerings and introducing innovative new products 
we are primarily focused especially on the following vertical market segments warehouse and distribution centers  direct store delivery dsd  field service  and postal and courier express parcel 
we are targeting these markets because we believe each has a favorable combination of growth and profit potential  scale economics and differentiation opportunities 
these market segments are expected to generate a significant portion of future estimated total sales of aidc products and represent attractive estimated compound annual growth rates 
in  our revenues outside of north america improved considerably as compared with this was primarily due to a modest recovery in the global economy  an increase in the number of our channel partners and an improvement in revenue per channel partner 
north america remained challenging in as growth in commercial revenues was more than offset by a decline in revenues from agencies of the us federal government 
we expect us federal government revenue to improve in but we do not expect a return to the level 
we anticipate continued growth in in international revenue and in north america commercial revenue and believe these revenues will more than offset any continued weakness in us federal government sales 
in  revenue in our product segment  including systems and solutions  printer and media  grew as compared with the results for our product segment reflect the regional factors described in the preceding paragraph 
service sales appear to be recovering from the economic downturn with a time lag behind product sales which is typical of the service segment of our business 
we anticipate continued growth in each of our segments in gross margins improved in as compared with due to favorable product and geographic mix 
we expect continued improvement in gross margins in because we believe that a combination of favorable mix and higher product volumes will more than offset any competitive pricing pressure and unfavorable currency translation 
in  our research and development r d expense net of r d tax credits was of gross revenue as compared with of gross revenue in this reflects the continued importance of new releases in our major product lines as well as an increase in the pace of innovation required in the mobile computing part of our business 
we expect similar levels of r d investment in so that we can launch the products in our pipeline and develop new ones 
in  our selling  general and administrative sg a expense was of gross revenue as compared with of gross revenue in we expect a modest increase in the sales and marketing portion of sg a expense in to support the launch of our new products and to increase the number of our channel partners and the amount of revenue per channel partner 
looking ahead  we plan to remain focused on the execution of our strategy to be the leader in rugged mobile business solutions in the aidc industry 
this will primarily involve organic activities such as increased marketing and sales efforts  channel partner expansion and the introduction of new and innovative hardware  software and services 
as we have in the past  we also intend to pursue mergers  acquisitions or joint ventures when we believe they are appropriate methods of executing our strategy 
in recent years  we have invested in programs that would benefit future periods  such as streamlining our product manufacturing and supply chain operations  expanding and refining our sales channel  implementing a new global enterprise resource planning erp system and developing products and services that will effectively support our strategy 
we have also significantly reduced our operating cost structure 
we believe these initiatives have positioned us to take advantage of improving economic conditions and other opportunities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued in january   we announced our plan to acquire vocollect  inc  a maker of voice recognition software and hardware for warehouses  distribution centers and other deployment environments 
refer to subsequent events in note m of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this acquisition is expected to give us the opportunity to more rapidly advance our solutions strategy and grow revenue and profits by adding innovative products and services and by bringing new partners into our channel 
we intend to secure these benefits with a methodical approach to the integration of vocollect  in which differences in business models and channel strategies are recognized and addressed in an appropriate manner 
we plan to continue to improve operational efficiency and reduce our costs

the increase in product gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to increased volume of product sales and more favorable product and geographic related mix 
the decrease in service gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december  was mainly attributable to the decline in us federal government business 
the total gross profit in decreased by million and the total gross margin decreased by basis points compared to the decrease in total gross margin in was due to a decrease in product gross margin  partially offset by an increase in service gross margin 
the decrease in total gross profit was primarily due to a million decrease in product gross profit  which was driven by reduced product volumes  less favorable product and geographic related mix  the unfavorable impact of currency translation and competitive pricing 
the decrease in product gross margin in was primarily attributable to reduced product volumes  less favorable product and geographic related mix  the unfavorable impact of currency translation and competitive pricing 
the increase in service gross margin in was mainly attributable to reduced service costs from the north america service depot consolidation program implemented in the third quarter of  and ongoing cost management 
research and development expense  net in millions year ended december  amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount research and development expense  net research and development r d expense increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to this increase in r d expense was due to increased r d investment for new product development and release

the decrease in sg a expense of million  or  in compared to reflected various cost reduction programs we implemented in in response to the global economic downturn 
labor related savings was approximately million  which accounted for of the total decrease in sg a expense in foreign exchange fluctuations in had a favorable impact on our sg a expense by million as compared to substantially all of the remaining decrease in sg a was attributable to a reduction in indirect and discretionary spending 
gain on intellectual property sales we recorded a million gain on intellectual property sales  net of commissions  as a result of sales of certain patents to unrelated parties for the year ended december  and restructuring charges in january and april  we committed to business restructuring plans intended to reorganize our sales function and reduce our work force

we recorded and million of the restructuring charges in and  respectively 
as of december   all restructuring related charges have been recorded  and substantially all of the severance related and periodic transitional costs were cash expenditures 
restructuring charges in july  we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations  which included the relocation of product final assembly to a contract manufacturer in asia  the consolidation of north american service depot locations and the transfer of on site repair in north america to a third party service provider 
all severance and other periodic transitional costs were cash expenditures 
all restructuring costs related to this action were accrued in the total restructuring charges incurred for the restructuring plan were million 
we believe these restructuring actions were appropriate strategically and were prudent in light of the generally weakened global economy and uncertain market conditions

in this interest expense was slightly greater than interest income earned on cash and investments due to lower average interest rates 
the decrease of net interest income of million in compared to was primarily due to lower average interest rates in interest rates were low during global recession as governments reduced borrowing rates to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability

this is a recurring item regardless of the amount of income from operations  and is approximately million tax expense annually 
our state tax expense was favorably impacted by million from elections made in when filing the tax returns and from other related adjustments 
the remaining tax expense primarily results from income in several foreig n jurisdictions and losses in singapore for which a valuation allowance has been provided 
the tax benefit for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of  compared to a us statutory rate of 
in the fourth quarter of  intermec recognized a us tax settlement benefit of approximately million which favorably impacted our rate for the quarter and the year

please refer to note j to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency transactions and effect of foreign exchange rates we are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program  which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
movements in foreign exchange rates  net of hedging activities  resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for fiscal year  our operations derived approximately of revenues from non us customers 
at december   long lived assets attributable to countries outside of the us comprised of total long lived assets 
the largest components of these assets are attributable to mexico  where we maintain product repair facilities  followed by singapore 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations 
cash flow summary the following discussion reflects the effects of the immaterial restatement presented in note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our cash flows are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by used in investing activities of continuing operations net cash used in provided by financing activities of continuing operations at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  a decrease of million compared to the december   balance of million 
our short term investments consist primarily of low risk securities  primarily consisting of time deposits 
we invest in these short term securities mainly to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation 
due to the nature of these instruments  we consider it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates  and that they can be liquidated for cash upon demand 
cash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss earnings adjusted for non cash items and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in for the year ended december    was million and consisted of net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of million 
operating activities in provided lower cash flows compared to  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue 
in  the million of cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to cash provided by working capital and other activities of million mainly due to volume driven decreases in accounts receivable and our efforts in inventory reduction  partially offset by cash payments for restructuring activities 
in  the million of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was primarily due to net earnings of million and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities for the year ended december   provided million of cash primarily due to sales of investments of million  partially offset by capital expenditure of million 
in  investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash primarily due to our purchase of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
in  investing activities provided million of cash primarily due to sale of investments of million and sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
financing activities for the year ended december   used cash of million primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock of million 
financing activities in provided cash of million  related primarily to the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercised stock options 
financing activities in used million of cash  primarily for the million debt repayment in march of capital resources our principal capital resources include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  we have an unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility with a maximum amount available under the revolving facility of million at december  net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on availability  we had borrowing capacity at december   of million under the revolving facility 
as of december   we had no borrowings under the revolving facility  and were in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving facility 
the revolving facility matures in october item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued as discussed in note m of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with vocollect the merger agreement pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of vocollect  in connection with which we entered into a revision of the revolving facility that would enable us to convert our existing million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility into a million  three year  secured revolving credit facility the new facility 
the new facility will be used to finance a portion of the merger  to finance our working capital requirements  for letters of credit  and for general corporate purposes 
the new facility will become effective on the date of the closing of the merger  provided tha t the closing date occurs on or before april  if the closing date does not occur prior to the april   the new facility will become null and void and the existing revolving facility will remain in full force and effect until it matures in october the key terms of the revolving facility and the new facility are as follows revolving facility new facility loans will bear interest at a variable rate equal to at our option i libor plus the applicable margin  which ranges from to  or ii the bank s prime rate  less the applicable margin  which ranges from to 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  then the interest rate on all obligations under the revolving facility may be increased by above the otherwise applicable rate  and the bank may declare any outstanding obligations under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable 
loans will bear interest at a variable rate equal to either i libor plus the applicable margin  which ranges from to  or if libor is not available  ii the base rate less the applicable margin  which ranges from to 
the base rate is equal to the higher of a the bank s prime rate  or b the federal funds effective rate plus basis points 
a fee ranging from to on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit that is issued and outstanding under the revolving facility 
the fee on the unused portion of the revolving facility ranges from to 
a fee ranging from to on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit that is issued and outstanding under the new facility 
the fee on the unused portion of the new facility ranges from to 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving facility 
if an event of default occurs  the bank may accelerate payment amounts due under the new facility at its option  the bank s obligation to extend further credit will cease and the bank may exercise its right with respect to i assets of certain domestic subsidiaries  ii the pledges of equity in certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries  and iii the guaranties of payment obligations from certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
the revolving facility contains various restrictions and covenants  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or dispose of assets 
the new facility contains various restrictions and covenants  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or dispose of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage test and a minimum tangible net worth test  each as defined in the revolving facility 
the minimum tangible net worth required is million and the maximum funded debt to ebitda allowed is financial covenants related to our tangible net worth  annual net income after taxes  quarterly adjusted net income before taxes and asset coverage ratio  each as defined in the new facility  will be set when the new facility becomes effective on the date of closing 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments combined with projected cash flows from operations and funds available from the revolving and new credit facility noted above will provide adequate funding for the pending acquisition of vocollect  and to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure  and pension contribution requirements for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may look for potential acquisition targets for growth opportunities within our market  or to expand into new markets  which we believe can be funded with a combination of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and additional financing 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued the business restructuring plan that we committed to in april reduced our workforce and resulted in the curtailment of pension benefits to the terminated employees who were participants in our us pension plans 
additionally  on december   we announced the decision to amend our pension plans and freeze the remainder of our us pension plans effective february  these actions are expected to substantially reduce our future pension benefits cost 
we are required to make minimum funding for these plans under the employee retirement income security act of erisa or other rules governing funding of pension plans 
we may also make discretionary contributions to fund these plans in future years 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plans in during the year ended december   we entered into share repurchase agreements with a broker under rule b and rule b of the securities exchange act of  to facilitate the repurchase of up to an aggregate total of million of our outstanding common stock  pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization by our board of directors 
we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of per share under these share repurchase agreements 
we may continue to engage in future share repurchases up to our remaining board authorization of million 
the number of shares and the timing of any share repurchases will depend on factors such as the stock price  economic and market conditions  regulatory restrictions  and the attractiveness of other capital deployment opportunities 
depending on our assessment of the economic environment from time to time  we may decide to hold more cash than may be required to fund our future investment in working capital  capital expenditures and research and development and to implement changes in our cost structure 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on our revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flows from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  in millions 
the table does not include amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments pension and other postretirement cash funding requirements total contractual obligations operating leases are discussed in note f of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement plans are discussed in note k of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of finished goods or raw materials or other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
we have requirements to provide minimum funding for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans under erisa regulations 
we may make future discretionary contributions to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
see note k of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december   has been omitted from the table above  because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain indemnification and reimbursement agreements 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note l to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue  net of excise and sales taxes  when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
we consider these criteria met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned  the amount due is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is recognized when the customer has assumed risk of loss of the goods sold and all performance obligations are complete 
these sales may contain discounts  price exception  return provision or other customer incentives 
we reduce revenue by providing allowances for estimated customer returns  price exception and other incentives that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
the sales allowances are based on management s best estimate of the amount of allowances that the customer will ultimately receive and on our historical experience taking into account the type of products sold and type of customers involved 
we accrue the estimated cost of basic product warranties at the time we recognize revenue based on historical experience 
in addition to bas ic product warranties  we frequently offer extended warranties  including renewal  to our customers in the form of product maintenance services 
our product and maintenance services are typically separately priced 
we defer the stated amount of the separately priced product maintenance services contracts and recognize the deferred revenue as services are rendered  generally straight line over the contract term 
we infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements with our customers  and these sales may include deliverables such as hardware  software  professional consulting services and maintenance support services 
for arrangements involving multiple deliverables  where deliverables include software and non software products and services  we apply the provisions of multiple elements accounting to separate the deliverables and allocate the total arrangement consideration 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
we sell products with embedded software to our customers 
the embedded software is not sold separately  it is not a significant focus of the marketing effort and we do not provide post contract customer support specific to the software or incur significant costs related to creating software products 
additionally  the functionality that the software provides is marketed as part of the overall product 
the software embedded in the product is incidental to the equipment as a whole such that software revenue recognition is not generally applicable 
in certain infrequent situations where our solutions contain software that is more than incidental to the hardware and services  revenue related to the software and software related elements is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition accounting 
our customers infrequently request that delivery and passage of title and risk of loss occur on a bill and hold basis 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue in accordance with guidance specific to bill and hold transactions 
inventory obsolescence 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  or there are technology or design changes  additional inventory write downs could be required  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions  and or technology or design changes  could positively impact future operating results if previously written down inventory is sold 
management continues to evaluate market and technology c onditions and design changes to ensure that our reserves are adequate 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which include million of general business credit carry forwards and million of foreign tax credit carry forwards with expiration dates ranging from through the remainder of our deferred tax assets consist of tax timing items including postretirement obligations  deferred revenue and capitalized r d 
our valuation allowance against these tax assets is less than million 
in analyzing utilization of our deferred tax assets  we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisd ictions in which we operate and prudent  feasible and permissible tax planning strategies 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we also recognize the largest amount of benefits from uncertain tax positions that are greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
such amounts are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential as sessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have qualified and nonqualified pension plans that cover some of our employees 
some of these pension plans were partially frozen in june additionally  on december   we made the decision to fully freeze our us qualified pension plan  effective february  our us nonqualified plans were fully frozen effective december  annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
we perform an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets or when major events occur requiring remeasurement 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most important of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and health care cost projections 
these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively affecting our future annual expense and projected benefit obligation 
the rate used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the weighted average discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans as of december   were and respectively  compared to and as of december  the decrease in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost would result in an increase in benefit obligation of million 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the market related value of assets 
for the market related value of assets  a calculated basis is used to reflect a smoothed actuarial value of assets  equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period for us plans and a three year period for us plans 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return for our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would result in an increase in our net periodic pension cost of million 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over eighteen years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation wo uld result in an increase or decrease of approximately million 
the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions is recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the period in which they occur 
see note k of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb updated its guidance on software revenue recognition rules 
according to this update  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality  are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this update requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
this update provides additional guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product should be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  we are still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance 
historically software has been incidental to our hardware  and we would not expect the adoption on our similar historical arrangements to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb updated its guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
it alters the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
this update also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a market participant 
it also elimin ates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning january  we are still assessing the potential impact of adopting this guidance 
we have historically not had significant multiple deliverable arrangements  and we would not expect the adoption on our similar historical arrangements to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we conduct business in approximately countries and generally invoice customers in their local currency  resulting in a foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable balance 
our subsidiaries also purchase certain raw materials and other items in local currencies 
our treasury policies allow us to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures through the purchase of foreign exchange forward contracts 
our policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange arising from intercompany transactions  specifically for inventory purchases made by our subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we record these contracts at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change 
these contracts do not contai n any credit risk related contingent features 
we attempt to manage the counterparty risk associated with these foreign exchange forward contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have an established banking relationship 
in addition  these contracts generally settle in approximately days 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
the actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  if changes in the timing and amount of currency exchange rate movements and our hedging activities are different from during the year ended december   million  or  of our sales were denominated in us dollars  million  or  denominated in euros  million  or  denominated in british pounds  and million  or denominated in other foreign currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted our sales by approximately million in  in comparison to
