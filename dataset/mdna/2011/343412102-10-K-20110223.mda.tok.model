item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding corporate general and administrative expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
for a reconciliation of segment profit to earnings before taxes  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue of billion in decreased compared to consolidated revenue of billion primarily because large revenue increases in the industrial infrastructure and government segments were more than offset by a significant revenue decline in the oil gas segment 
consolidated revenue of billion in was essentially level with consolidated revenue of billion 
the revenue for the industrial infrastructure and government segments increased in when compared to the prior year  while revenue decreases occurred in the other three segments 
the global recession continues to impact the near term capital investment plans of many of the company clients across all of the company segments except government and the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines of the industrial infrastructure segment 
the timing of the expected recovery for the businesses impacted by the recession remains uncertain  though there are some signs of recovery in the oil gas segment as demonstrated by significant new award activity in the latter part of and a corresponding increase in the segment backlog by the end of compared to the global recession has also resulted in a highly competitive business environment that has put increased pressure on margins 
this trend is expected to continue and  in certain cases  may result in more lump sum project execution for the company 
in some instances  margins are being negatively impacted by the change in the mix of work performed eg  a higher content of mining and metals project execution activities  which generally earn lower margins than other projects 
earnings before taxes were million in  down from billion in the decrease in earnings for was primarily due to the impact of charges totaling million for the greater gabbard project in the united kingdom and a charge totaling million for a completed infrastructure joint venture project in california  both discussed in more detail in industrial infrastructure below 
some of the impact of the charges for the greater gabbard project and the infrastructure joint venture project was offset by improved performance in on other industrial infrastructure projects in the infrastructure and mining and metals business lines 
the results were also impacted by the lower 
table of contents volume and associated earnings in the oil gas segment due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in through have been completed or are near completion 
in addition  the earnings of the segment were impacted by slower new award activity during and the first half of related to the global recession  a decline in the demand for new capacity in the refining  petrochemical and polysilicon markets  and a highly competitive business environment that has resulted from changed market conditions 
improved performance was noted in the government  global services and power segments for the improvement in the government segment was primarily the result of a higher level of project execution activities to support the united states army in afghanistan 
the global services segment increase in profitability in compared to the prior year was primarily because the period included a million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill project 
the power segment contributed higher earnings during compared to the prior year mostly due to higher contributions from the oak grove coal fired power project and a gas fired power plant  both in texas 
these positive results in the power segment were offset somewhat by charges of million taken in on a gas fired power project in georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project 
the company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in when compared to  primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation 
earnings before taxes were billion in both and the segment profit of the oil gas segment increased slightly from  while the performance of both the government and power segments improved significantly 
the segment profit of the industrial infrastructure segment declined when compared to the prior year  primarily because included a million pre tax gain from the sale of the company joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project  partially offset by charges totaling million for a fixed price telecommunications project in the united kingdom  both discussed under industrial infrastructure below 
the performance of the global services segment was negatively impacted by the million charge for the uncollectability of paper mill project receivable  noted above  and the effects of the recession when compared to segment results 
the company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in when compared to  primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation related costs  though much of this improvement was offset by a significant decrease in net interest income in due to the impact of lower interest rates 
the effective tax rate was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the lower rate was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses 
the effective tax rate for included favorable benefits resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances  statute expirations and tax settlements 
factors affecting the effective tax rates for are discussed further under corporate  tax and other matters below 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation were per diluted share in compared to and per diluted share in and  respectively 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in included the negative impact of the following pre tax charges previously discussed million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project  million per diluted share for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in california  and million  per diluted share for the gas fired power project in georgia 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in also included the million per diluted share tax benefit described above for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter 
a significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the greater gabbard project charges on the foreign subsidiary 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in included a million per diluted share pre tax charge for the uncollectability of the paper mill project receivable in the global services segment noted above 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in reflected the positive effect of the sale of the joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project million pre tax  or per diluted share and the negative impact of charges for the fixed price telecommunications project in the united kingdom 
table of contents million pre tax  or per diluted share  both in the industrial infrastructure segment and discussed above 
consolidated new awards for were billion  compared to billion in  and billion in the increase in new award activity in was driven by the strength of the mining and metals business line in the industrial infrastructure segment and strong new award activity during the last half of the year in the oil gas segment 
the decrease in new award activity in was attributable to the oil gas  global services and power segments  offset somewhat by increased new awards in industrial infrastructure and government 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 
consolidated backlog was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  the increase in backlog during was due to the strength of the new award activity noted above in the industrial infrastructure and oil gas segments 
the decrease in backlog during was primarily due to certain project cancellations and scope reductions  as well as work performed on existing projects outpacing new award activity 
the oil gas segment experienced a sharp decline in backlog in  offset somewhat by an increase in industrial infrastructure backlog 
the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in cancellations and scope reductions of certain projects in the oil gas segment during the segment backlog at the end of was also negatively impacted by the end of the capacity expansion in the north american refining market 
the growth in industrial infrastructure backlog was driven by new award activity in the mining and metals business line 
as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate general and administrative expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate  tax and other matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies engineering and construction contracts contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
contracts are generally segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
as of december   percent of the company backlog was cost reimbursable while percent was for fixed price  lump sum  guaranteed maximum or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance 
table of contents criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes revenue  but not profit  for certain significant claims when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable under asc  and when the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims against clients amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cost  but not profit  associated with unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  revisions to project scope and cost  and deferrals  as appropriate 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties 
generally  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership interest that requires only a small initial investment 
the arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and or secure specialty skills required for project execution 
the company evaluates at inception each partnership and joint venture to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under accounting standards codification asc a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the majority of the company partnerships and joint ventures qualify as vies because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in asc  the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a vie 
the company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each vie and consolidates the vie if the company has both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
the company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure  distribution of profits and losses  risks  responsibilities  indebtedness  voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary 
the company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary 
in most cases  the company does not qualify as the primary beneficiary 
when the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary  the vie is consolidated 
as required by asc  management assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie is continuously performed 
most of the company partnerships and joint ventures do not meet the requirements for full consolidation and are accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting  though the equity and cost methods of accounting for the investments are also used  depending on the company respective ownership interest  amount of influence in the vie and other factors 
under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting  the company recognizes its proportionate share of revenue  cost and segment profit in the consolidated statement of earnings and uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing of goodwill is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for purposes of impairment testing  goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure 
during  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company financial statements or tax returns 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the allowance for primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company effective tax rate on future earnings 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans asc 
as required by asc  the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the company financial statements 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rates were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities for the us and us plans would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance and project management 
the company is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
for more information on the business segments see item business above 
oil gas revenue and segment profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit 
table of contents revenue and segment profit in decreased percent and percent  respectively  compared to due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in through have been completed or are near completion 
in addition  revenue and segment profit in were impacted by slower new award activity during and the first half of revenue in decreased nearly percent when compared to due to reduced project execution activities as many large projects within the segment neared completion 
segment profit margin was percent in compared to percent in and percent in segment profit margin in was comparatively higher than in and primarily due to the net positive impact of adjustments in for certain projects nearing completion  which were primarily due to the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items 
segment profit margin in was also impacted by lower operating leverage as business volume had contracted  along with a more competitive business environment 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in new awards in included upstream services associated with a liquefied natural gas project in australia valued at billion and an oil sands program in canada valued at billion 
new awards in included a canadian oil sands program valued at billion and an expansion to an onshore production facility in russia 
new awards in included two refinery expansion projects in the united states valued at billion and billion  and a billion polysilicon project in china 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  and billion as of december  in through  the segment participated in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographical locations  which were well suited to the company global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
the global recession  changing market conditions and a decline in demand for new capacity in the refining  petrochemical and polysilicon markets resulted in lower new award activity in and the first half of  as well as billion of project cancellations and scope reductions during as a consequence of this lower level of new award activity and the project cancellations and scope reductions  the segment revenue and segment profit declined when compared to the two previous years  and backlog for and was significantly less than for although the segment continues to be impacted by some of the effects of the recession  there are indications that the segment is seeing the initial signs of a recovery as demonstrated by significant new awards in the last two quarters of and a corresponding increase in backlog by the end of compared to this recovery is expected to be stronger in certain markets outside of the united states  including the middle east and asia 
it is anticipated that a highly competitive business environment will continue to put pressure on margins and  in certain cases  may result in more lump sum project execution for the segment 
total assets in the segment were million as of december   million as of december  and billion as of december  the higher level of total assets in compared to and was primarily to support a higher level of project execution activities 
industrial infrastructure revenue and segment profit for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit loss revenue in increased percent compared to primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line 
revenue in increased percent from due to significant growth in the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines 

table of contents segment profit and segment profit margin declined significantly in compared to due to the impact of significant charges for two infrastructure projects 
for the greater gabbard project  a billion lump sum project to provide engineering  procurement and construction services for the client offshore wind farm project in the united kingdom  charges totaling million were taken in the last two quarters of for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges  including material and equipment delivery issues  productivity issues and the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor 
the project forecast has been revised for the cost overruns and includes substantial costs for additional maritime assets and other subcontractor costs associated with equipment installation  equipment repairs and the estimated schedule impact 
weather related delays have further impacted the schedule and project cost forecast 
the company has taken a number of actions to mitigate further cost escalation and delays to the schedule  though there is uncertainty as to the potential impact on cost and schedule of any further weather related delays  the potential unavailability of maritime assets and any further productivity issues 
the segment also recorded a charge of million during the current year for a completed million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project to provide engineering  procurement and construction services for a roadway near san diego  california 
on october   the company received notice of a ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against the bankrupt client entity that impairs the joint venture ability to recover cost overruns resulting from owner directed scope changes that led to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays 
as a result of the ruling  the company determined that the likelihood of collecting its claims related costs and certain other amounts it is due is no longer considered probable 
the charges for the greater gabbard project and the infrastructure joint venture project were offset somewhat by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year  including million of fees earned at financial closing for an infrastructure rail project  million for the final negotiated settlement and closeout of both an infrastructure road project and an infrastructure telecommunications project  and million for the approval of a significant change order for another infrastructure road project 
in addition  there were increased contributions in segment profit for the current year compared to last year due to a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line noted above 
segment profit and segment profit margin for declined compared to primarily because the period included a pre tax gain of million from the sale of the company joint venture interest in the greater gabbard project  offset somewhat by the impact of charges totaling million related to the london connect project 
segment profit margin in was also negatively impacted as the result of a significant shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering and feasibility studies to lower margin construction activities in the manufacturing and life sciences and mining and metals business lines  the continuation of the downturn in the life sciences market and reduced margins on greater gabbard project execution activities in the infrastructure business line 
in addition  the segment experienced lower margins in as the result of the consolidation of a large mining project joint venture in which the segment reports all of the joint venture revenue  but only the segment share of the joint venture profit 
revenue of billion and million was recognized for this project in and  respectively 
the company is involved in a dispute in connection with the greater gabbard project 
the dispute relates to the company claim for additional compensation for schedule and cost impacts arising from delays in the fabrication of monopiles and transition pieces  and disruption and productivity issues associated with construction activities and weather related delays 
the company believes the schedule and cost impacts are attributable to the client and other third parties 
as of december   the company had recorded million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date 
significant additional project costs related to the claim are expected to be incurred in future quarters and  as a result  claim revenue will increase during the life of the project 
the company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs related to the claim is probable under asc the company will continue to periodically evaluate its position and the amount recognized in revenue with respect to this claim 
the company participated in a joint venture for a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
this joint venture project was adversely impacted by higher costs due to owner 
table of contents directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  additional labor and schedule delays 
as noted above  during  the segment recorded a charge of million after an adverse ruling on the priority of the joint venture claims against the bankrupt client entity 
as of december   the company had recognized in cost and revenue its million proportionate share of million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture 
total claims related costs incurred  as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture  were in excess of the million of recognized cost 
the million charge included amounts for the million of claim revenue and the company proportionate share of liquidated damages million  draw downs against letters of credit million and certain other assets million 
the project opened to traffic in november and reached construction completion in the second quarter of the company continues to evaluate claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project and continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process 
the company was involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with the london connect project  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the london underground system 
the project  which is now complete  was subject to significant delays  resulting in additional costs to the company and claims against the client 
as mentioned previously  during  charges of million were recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims 
in  the company settled the dispute with no material change to segment profit 
as a result of the settlement  the company did not report claim revenue for the project at the end of and  which totaled million as of december  new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion during and billion during the increased new award activity in was primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line  with significant contributions from the infrastructure business line 
the new awards in included an aluminum program in saudi arabia valued at billion  a billion copper mine in chile and billion for an infrastructure rail project in the united states 
new awards during were driven by the mining and metals business line  including a billion iron ore project in australia and a billion nickel project in canada 
new awards during reflected substantial activity in mining and metals and also included the infrastructure business line greater gabbard project 
ending backlog for the segment increased to billion for from billion for and billion for the growth in backlog during was driven by the substantial new award activity in the mining and metals business line 
the growth in backlog during was the result of the significant new award activity for the year and project adjustments of billion 
the project adjustments were primarily due to the positive impact on backlog of a weakening us dollar for projects awarded in other currencies and revisions to project cost  mainly for customer furnished materials and the greater gabbard project 
total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease in total assets in compared to was primarily attributable to a reduction in work in process on the greater gabbard project with the installation of certain offshore materials and the write off of the investment for the infrastructure joint venture project in california 
the increase in total assets in compared to was primarily due to an increase in working capital and other assets to support the greater gabbard project and the increased volume of the segment 

table of contents government revenue and segment profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue for the government segment in and increased percent and percent compared to and  respectively  primarily due to the execution of logistics civil augmentation program logcap iv task orders for the united states army in afghanistan 
revenue growth in both and for the savannah river site management and operating project the savannah river project in south carolina and american recovery and reinvestment act arra funded work at savannah river was offset by a decrease in revenue at the hanford environmental management project the hanford project in the state of washington  which was completed in segment profit for the government segment during and increased percent and percent compared to and  respectively  primarily as the result of additional work associated with logcap iv task orders 
the increase in segment profit in compared to was also due to improved contributions from the savannah river project  project execution activities associated with arra funding at savannah river and million of income related to awards for equitable adjustment on a fixed price contract at the bagram air base in afghanistan 
the higher segment profit in was offset somewhat by reduced contributions for the hanford project and iraq related work 
the company performed work on embassy projects over the last seven years for the us department of state under fixed priced contracts 
these projects were adversely impacted by higher costs due to schedule extensions  scope changes causing material deviations from the standard embassy design  increased costs to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor  site conditions at certain locations  subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor 
the last of the embassy projects was completed in  with some warranty items for one project still ongoing 
as of december   aggregate costs totaling million relating to claims on two of the embassy projects had been recognized in revenue 
total claims related costs incurred to date  along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified  exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue 
as the first formal step in dispute resolution  all claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements 
the company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims 
new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared to billion during and billion during significant new awards for included logcap iv task orders  which drove the increase in new award activity compared to  and the annual funding for the savannah river project 
significant new awards for included the annual funding for the savannah river project  the multi year arra funding at savannah river and logcap iv task orders 
the increase in new awards in was primarily due to the multi year funding of arra work at savannah river and logcap iv task orders 
the savannah river project transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in the company reports new awards for logcap iv as individual task orders are awarded and funded 
backlog for the segment was million as of december   billion as of december  and million as of december  the higher backlog in compared to both and was primarily due to the multi year funding at savannah river that was a new award in and that was partially worked off by the end of 
table of contents total assets in the government segment were billion as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in total assets in both and 
table of contents corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities  particularly for logcap iv task orders 
global services revenue and segment profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue for the global services segment decreased percent during compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the equipment business line iraq business activities 
this revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to the gulf coast oil spill cleanup in the operations and maintenance business line 
the percent decrease in revenue in when compared to is primarily due to declining volumes of capital work and fewer refinery turnarounds and shutdowns 
the segment began to be impacted by the global recession during the fourth quarter of  particularly for natural resource prospects 
in certain cases  refinery turnaround and shutdown work previously awarded to the operations and maintenance business line continues to be performed internally by the clients themselves 
all of the business lines of the segment continue to be affected by the weak economy and it remains unclear as to when a broad based recovery will occur 
segment profit for the segment increased percent in compared to primarily because the prior year period included a million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill where the company scope of work was to recommission  start up and operate the facility 
segment profit in benefitted from the gulf coast oil spill cleanup activities  though the resulting positive contribution was more than offset by the overall weak economic conditions impacting all business lines  including the continued delay and reduction in capital work and maintenance activities in the operations and maintenance business line and reduced activity in the domestic and european operations of the temporary staffing business line 
segment profit declined percent in compared to because of the million charge for the paper mill receivable noted above and the impact of the economic and market conditions mentioned previously on the operations and maintenance  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines 
segment profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the lower segment profit margin was due to the factors that impacted segment profit noted above 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  million during and billion during new awards in included additional work from existing clients  including ibm and sapref of south africa 
the decline in new awards in compared to was indicative of the economic and market conditions discussed above 
new awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients backlog for the global services segment was billion as of december  and billion as of both december  and the increase in backlog at the end of related to the higher level of new awards in operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise global services backlog 
short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog 
in addition  the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards 
total assets in the global services segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in the segment total assets in and was due to an increase in working capital to support projects in the 
table of contents operations and maintenance business line  additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements 
power revenue and segment profit for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit power segment revenue in and decreased percent and percent compared to and  respectively  primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on the oak grove coal fired power project in texas for luminant  a unit of energy futures holdings corporation  which reached final completion in also in  revenue increases associated with project execution activities on gas fired power plant projects located in texas  virginia and georgia were largely offset by a decline in revenue due to reduced volume on various other projects progressing toward completion 
segment profit in increased percent compared to primarily due to increased contributions from the oak grove project as a result of reaching final completion and acceptance and achieving contractual performance guarantees  along with improved performance from a gas fired power plant project in texas 
these positive results were partially offset by charges of million taken in on a gas fired power project in georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project 
segment profit in increased compared to primarily due to increased activity on several gas turbine projects  increased pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in texas and project completion adjustments for two emissions control programs 
in addition  segment profit in was negatively impacted by a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of million for the long completed rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia 
segment profit margin in the power segment was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in segment profit margin are explained by the same factors that impacted segment profit  discussed above 
the power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions 
in addition  power producers have been impacted by the global recession and continuing reduced demand 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount  but occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of million in included work for nuclear preconstruction services and the renewal of the luminant system wide fossil maintenance program in texas 
new awards of billion in included the dominion bear garden gas fired plant in virginia and nuclear preconstruction services 
new awards of billion in include a gas fired power plant in texas  expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in texas for luminant 
backlog for the power segment was million as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  the decline in backlog since is primarily because the work performed on the oak grove project  major gas fired power plant projects in texas  virginia and georgia  and certain other projects was not replaced by new award activity 
total assets in the power segment decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  and million as of december  due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities  including the oak grove project 
corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   and  corporate general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation costs  offset somewhat by foreign currency losses and other factors 
corporate general and administrative expense included million of non operating expense in both and  and million of non operating expense in  of which million is for a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the united kingdom
