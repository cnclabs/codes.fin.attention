unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc delivers productivity to customers seeking peak performance in demanding environments by providing innovative custom and standard wear resistant solutions  enabled through our advanced materials sciences  application knowledge and commitment to a sustainable environment 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence  as well as our technological expertise and innovation in our principal products  has helped us to achieve a leading market presence in our primary markets 
we believe that we are one of the largest global providers of consumable metalcutting tools and tooling supplies 
in  the company achieved sequential sales growth each quarter  with an organic sales increase of percent for the year 
the company had strong earnings per diluted share eps of as a result of sales growth and solid operating margins 
we completed our restructuring programs which are expected to reduce our cost structure by approximately million annually  yielding higher benefits on costs that were lower than anticipated 
for  sales were billion  an increase of percent compared to prior year sales of billion 
operating income was million  an increase of million compared to operating income of million in the increase in operating income was primarily due to sales volume and price realization  improved capacity utilization and incremental restructuring benefits of approximately million  partially offset by higher raw material costs 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million in the current year 
capital expenditures were million during the year 
in addition  we invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering a high level of new products to our customers 
research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled million for in  we generated approximately percent of our sales from new products 
new operating structure in order to take additional advantage of growth opportunities as well as to provide a better platform for continually improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations  we implemented a new operating structure as of july  we restated the segment financial information for the years ended june  and  respectively  to reflect the change in reportable operating segments 
the new structure provides for an enhanced market sector approach coupled with a more customer centric focus for the sales organization and other key market facing functions such as customer service  marketing  product management  engineering and product development 
the new structure also involves the formation of a single  global integrated supply chain and logistics organization that unleashes additional opportunities to achieve higher customer satisfaction and realize lower costs to serve 
furthermore  the new structure provides for more uniform management of administrative functions on a global basis to further improve the consistency  effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided by these functions 
a key attribute of the new structure is the establishment of two new operating segments by market sector which replace the previous two operating segments that were based on a product focus 
the two new reportable operating segments are named industrial and infrastructure 
the industrial business is primarily focused on customers within the transportation  aerospace  defense and general engineering market sectors 
the infrastructure business is primarily focused on customers within the energy and earthworks industries 
the formation of the two new reportable operating segments is consistent with the new management approach and internal financial reporting established under the new structure 
under the new structure  more corporate expenses will be allocated to the new segments than were allocated to the previous segments 
the remaining corporate expenses that are determined to be non allocable will continue to be reported as corporate 

table of contents restructuring actions during  we completed our restructuring programs to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
these programs related to the rationalization of certain manufacturing and service facilities  as well as other employment and cost reduction programs 
restructuring and related charges recorded in amounted to million 
this included million of restructuring charges of which million were related to inventory disposals and recorded as cost of goods sold 
restructuring related charges of million were recorded in cost of goods sold and million in operating expense during we realized pre tax benefits from these restructuring programs of approximately million during the company s restructuring programs are expected to deliver annual ongoing pre tax savings of approximately million now that all programs are fully implemented 
total pre tax charges recorded from inception to june  was approximately million 
acquisitions and divestitures in and  we had no acquisitions or divestitures 
in  we acquired tricon metals and services inc tricon in our infrastructure segment for a net purchase price of million 
tricon is a leading supplier of custom wear solutions specializing in consumable proprietary steels for the surface and underground mining markets  including hard rock and coal 
during  we also made an acquisition within our industrial segment 
we also had one divestiture in that was accounted for as discounted operations and described below 
discontinued operations on june   we divested our high speed steel business hss from our industrial segment as part of our continuing focus to shape our business portfolio and rationalize our manufacturing footprint 
this divestiture was accounted for as discontinued operations 
cash proceeds from this divestiture amounted to million 
we incurred pre tax charges related to the divestiture of million and million during and  respectively 
the pre tax charges as well as the related tax effects were recorded in discontinued operations 
we do not expect to incur any additional pre tax charges related to this divestiture 
the following represents the results of discontinued operations for the years ended june in thousands sales loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from discontinued operations results of continuing operations sales sales of  million in increased percent from  million in as a result of strong organic growth 
organic sales increased in both segments and across all regions 
organic sales growth drivers were general engineering of percent  transportation of percent and energy markets of percent 
sales of  million in decreased percent from  million in sales declined organically by percent as a result of the global economy  partially offset by a percent increase from favorable foreign currency effects and a percent increase from an acquisition 
organic sales declined in europe and the americas  partially offset by an organic sales increase in asia 
organic sales decreased in both segments primarily due to lower sales in general engineering of percent and reduced demand in energy markets of percent  partially offset by an increase in the transportation and earthworks market sectors of percent and percent  respectively 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased organic sales of million  price realization  improved absorption of manufacturing costs due to higher production levels  cost reduction benefits  favorable business mix and favorable foreign currency effects of million 
the impact of these items was partially offset by higher raw material costs and one time benefits in the prior year from certain labor negotiations in europe that did not occur in the current period 
the gross profit margin for increased to percent from percent in 
table of contents gross profit increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction benefits  lower raw material costs which more than offset unfavorable price realization  one time benefits from certain labor negotiations in europe  favorable foreign currency effects of million  a decrease in restructuring and related charges of million  as well as improved absorption of manufacturing costs due to higher production levels 
the impact of these items was partially offset by lower organic sales of  unfavorable business mix and the restoration of salaries and other employment costs that had been temporarily reduced 
the gross profit margin for increased to percent from percent in operating expense operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase is primarily driven by higher employment costs of million due to the reinstatement of salaries and other temporary employment cost reductions and a higher provision for incentive compensation of million  as a result of better operating performance 
foreign currency unfavorably impacted operating expense by million operating expense in was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in employment expenses driven by restructuring and cost management activities and a million decrease in the provision for bad debts 
these decreases were partially offset by higher provisions for incentive compensation programs of million  increased spending on strategic projects of million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of million 
restructuring and asset impairment charges during  we completed our restructuring programs and recognized million of restructuring charges of which million were recorded as restructuring charges including million related to inventory disposals and recorded in cost of goods sold 
no asset impairment occurred in see the discussion under the heading restructuring actions within this md a for additional information 
during  we continued to implement restructuring actions and recognized million of restructuring charges of which million were recorded as restructuring charges including million related to inventory disposals and recorded in cost of goods sold 
no asset impairment occurred in during  restructuring and related charges amounted to million  including million of restructuring charges of which million were related to inventory disposals and recorded in cost of goods sold 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
of this amount  million related to our surface finishing machines and services business and million related to our engineered products business 
no goodwill remains on the books for our surface finishing machines and services business and million of goodwill remains on the engineered products business 
we also recorded a million impairment charge for the indefinite lived trademark for our surface finishing machines and services business 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to a decrease in the average interest rates on domestic borrowings to percent  compared to percent in  partially offset by higher borrowings 
the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to lower borrowings  partially offset by an increase in the average interest rates on domestic borrowings to percent compared to percent in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively  due to lower borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facility 
other expense income  net in  other expense  net decreased by million to million expense  net compared to million income  net in the decrease was primarily due to a million unfavorable change in foreign currency transaction results  primarily driven by the euro 
in  other income  net decreased by million to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency transaction results of million  primarily due to the euro and a million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by increased income in international locations where the tax rate is lower than the us as well as restructuring charges in the prior year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be recognized 

table of contents the effective rate was favorably impacted by a million release of a valuation allowance in the united kingdom  but that impact was offset by the tax cost of approximately million  predominately us  associated with dividends of current year net income from some of our international subsidiaries 
the effective rate was unfavorably impacted by the expiration of the research  development and experimental tax credit as well as the impact of restructuring charges in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be recognized 
during  we generated taxable income in other jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the corresponding impact on the effective tax rate was immaterial 
in conjunction with our annual planning process during the fourth quarter of  we determined that sustainability of future income in the united kingdom is likely  and as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance adjustment of million that reduced tax expense 
with respect to the other jurisdictions  we believe sustainability of future income remains uncertain 
we therefore have not adjusted the valuation allowance in these jurisdictions 
we will continue to monitor our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions  and if appropriate  will adjust the valuation allowance 
such an adjustment would likely result in a material reduction to tax expense in the period the adjustment occurs 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent provision on income compared to percent benefit on a loss for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by asset impairment charges in the prior period 
in addition  the effective rate was unfavorably impacted by the expiration of the research  development and experimental tax credit as well as the impact of restructuring charges in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be recognized 
the effective rate benefited from a valuation allowance adjustment in europe 
income loss from continuing operations attributable to kennametal shareowners income from continuing operations attributable to kennametal shareowners was million  or per diluted share  in compared to million  or per diluted share  in the increase in income from continuing operations was a result of the factors previously discussed 
income from continuing operations attributable to kennametal shareowners was million  or per diluted share  in compared to loss of million  or per diluted share  in the increase in income from continuing operations was a result of the factors previously discussed 
business segment review we operate two reportable operating segments consisting of industrial and infrastructure 
corporate expenses that do not have a meaningful base for allocation are reported in corporate 
segment determination is based upon internal organizational structure  the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance  the availability of separate financial results and materiality considerations 
industrial external sales operating income loss external sales of  million in increased by million  or percent  from the increase in sales was attributed to an organic sales increase of percent and favorable foreign currency effects of percent  offset by the impact of fewer business days 
on an organic basis  sales increased in all served market sectors led by strong growth in general engineering and transportation sales of percent and percent  respectively 
on a regional basis  organic sales increased by approximately percent in asia  percent in europe and percent in the americas

these benefits were partially offset by higher raw material costs 
industrial operating income included restructuring and related charges of million and million in and  respectively 
industrial operating margin increased to percent from percent in the prior year 
external sales of  million in decreased by million  or percent  from the decrease in sales was attributed to organic sales decline of percent offset by favorable foreign currency effects of percent 
on an organic basis  sales decreased in both aerospace and defense and general engineering  by percent and percent  respectively  partially offset by an increase in transportation sales of percent 
on a regional basis  organic sales decreased by approximately percent in europe and percent in the americas  partially offset by a percent increase in asia 

table of contents operating income for was million and reflects an increase in operating performance of million from the operating loss generated in the primary drivers of the increase in operating performance were cost savings from restructuring programs  continued cost containment actions and favorable price realization  partially offset by lower organic sales of million

in  unallocated expense increased million from the increase was primarily due to million of higher strategic project spending and million higher foreign government subsidy income for certain research projects 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations is our primary source of funding for capital expenditures 
during the year ended june   cash flow provided by operating activities was million  driven by our operating performance 
to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds  we maintain a syndicated revolving credit facility 
on june  we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility credit agreement that extends to june this agreement replaces the prior credit facility that was scheduled to mature in march the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes

we are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at certain of our locations 
superfund sites we are involved as a prp at various sites designated by the usepa as superfund sites 
for certain of these sites  we have evaluated the claims and potential liabilities and have determined that neither are material  individually or in the aggregate 
for certain other sites  proceedings are in the very early stages and have not yet progressed to a point where it is possible to estimate the ultimate cost of remediation  the timing and extent of remedial action that may be required by governmental authorities or the amount of our liability alone or in relation to that of any other prps 
other environmental issues we establish and maintain reserves for other potential environmental issues

table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all stock option awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
these valuations are sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for certain employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on investment grade bond yield curves with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would increase or decrease  respectively  our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care cost increases is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would be immaterial to our pre tax income 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
we expect to contribute million and million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  in allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and  therefore  hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other expense income  net 
see notes and set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have paid immaterial amounts at june  and  respectively  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these contracts 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive loss income  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates  while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
table of contents related to these borrowings 
we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts outstanding for forecasted transactions that effectively converted a cumulative notional amount of million and million from floating to fixed interest rates as of june  and  respectively 
these contracts are expected to be settled by december we would have paid million and million at june  and  respectively  to settle these interest rate swap contracts  which represented the fair value of these contracts 
fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap contracts 
at june  and  we had no such contracts in place 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding debt  including capital leases and notes payable 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
on june   we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility credit agreement that extends to june this agreement replaces the prior credit facility that was scheduled to mature in march the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of june  also during july  the company completed the issuance of million shares of its common stock generating net proceeds of million which were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility
