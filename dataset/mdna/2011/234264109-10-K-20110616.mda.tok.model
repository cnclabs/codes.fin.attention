item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our relationship with sdsu and other colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained long term growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
over the years  our products have evolved significantly  from scoreboards and matrix displays and related software applications to complex  integrated visual display systems that include full color video  text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network and tied together through sophisticated control systems 
in the mid nineties  as light emitting diodes leds became available in red  blue and green colors with outdoor brightness  we pioneered the development of full color led video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors  thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color  brightness  energy efficiency and lifetime 
due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems  in which we were already a leader  we were able to add video capabilities so all of a customer s large format display needs could be met in a complete  integrated system 
this has proven to be a key factor in daktronics becoming the dominant company worldwide in large electronic displays 
over the years  we have invested in product development to add complementary products and services  such as production services  liquid crystal display lcd networks  architectural lighting solutions  sound systems  marketing services  maintenance and support and other products for our customers 
business developments 
as a result of our line of led display systems and software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are in use throughout the world  as we are the world s leader in all led display product categories  according to independent research 
in the sports market  our integrated video and scoring systems have been installed at many professional  collegiate and high school facilities  particularly in north america  and at international sporting events such as the olympic games 
with commercial applications  our video  digital billboard and graphics displays can be seen in major destination sites  such as las vegas and times square  along roadsides at retail establishments and at many other locations 
in the transportation market  our vanguard displays are in use in numerous jurisdictions across north america  and our customers include many state departments of transportation 
one of our core growth strategies on a historical basis has been to enter geographic markets by developing a small sales and service presence that provides after sale support to our entire product line and sales of our products 
this network of offices  including home offices  had been an important part of our growth strategy 
although we expect to continue to open offices where it is important to have such a presence  in fiscal and through fiscal  we closed a number of offices that we believed were not critical to our business 
in connection with these closings  more of our employees have transitioned to home offices 
we currently have approximately corporate offices throughout the world 
we occasionally acquire businesses that provide access to new markets or complement our existing products 
in the past five years  we have acquired a number of small companies 
although these acquisitions increased the scope of services and technology that we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is still the increase of sales and profitability through organic growth 
we manufacture most of our products in south dakota and minnesota 
prior to  almost all manufacturing was centralized in brookings  south dakota 
as a result of the rapid growth during fiscal years through  we experienced limitations in our ability to effectively hire sufficient numbers of employees in manufacturing 
this caused us to expand operations in into sioux falls  south dakota and redwood falls  minnesota 
we also invested in facilities in shanghai  china where we manufacture our architectural lighting products and perform final assembly for video displays for the chinese market 
we also have a plant in victor  new york that produces our rigging products which we acquired through an acquisition of the rigging business 
financial information about segments see note of the consolidated financial statements for financial information pertaining to our business segments and geographic operations 
description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems and related marketing services  digital messaging solutions  software and services for sporting  commercial and transportation applications 
our continuing focus is on supporting customers with superior products  integration and services that provide dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large multi million dollar video display systems as well as related control  timing  sound and hoist systems and related professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and product development  manufacturing  technical contracting  professional services and customer service and support 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we rely primarily on resellers 
we also utilize resellers outside north america on large video system projects where we do not have a direct sales presence 
sales to resellers generally have terms consistent with sales directly to end users 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and our sales force support in the field 
we believe that we can expand sales and  in some niches  market share  by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
our direct sales force is comprised of a network of corporate and home offices located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as described above  the direct sales staff sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all of the large video display systems 
our direct sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across segments 
we have organized our business into five business units which have a primary focus on particular markets and a secondary focus on opportunities in other markets 
the business units consist of four domestic business units that include us and canada commercial  live events  schools and theatres  and transportation and a fifth business unit for all international operations 
we believe that customers in each of these areas share common attributes and are different from customers in the other areas which make them conducive to this structure 
for example  live events customers usually have a large variety of products tied into a system in a single location that involves much more creative production services  design and event support 
the commercial business unit serves the needs created by large and remote networks of displays connected through various modes of communication 
the transportation business unit focuses on the unique needs of governmental contractors and ties into integrated systems that manage the flow of travelers and vehicles 
finally  the schools and theatre business unit focuses on the increasing level of support and service and limited resources along with all the statistics and related software and communication needs of athletic conferences and leagues 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host customers at our various manufacturing facilities to demonstrate product quality  manufacturing and design capabilities 
international sales can fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit or partial payment in advance 
we believe that in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened international offices in canada  china  france  the united arab emirates  germany  australia  japan and the united kingdom 
much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and other personnel and through attending trade shows  conventions and seminars and fostering a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately of our net sales over the long term into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  software design and customer and product support 
we use primarily in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we assign product managers to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training and implementing product improvements  and to ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our engineering staff consists of four product development groups sports  video  commercial and transportation 
the sports product development group focus is aligned with the schools and theatres business unit  the video group is aligned with the live events  international and commercial business units  and the commercial and transportation groups are aligned with the commercial and transportation business units 
during fiscal  this alignment started to evolve into various knowledge centers across the product development groups for the purpose of leveraging knowledge and concepts across product lines 
this alignment has driven improved product reliability  lower costs and better functionality for our customers 
the development of these knowledge centers and various other practices within product development are modeled after best practices for lean product development 
manufacturing 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
we flex our production capacity through varying work hours and the use of outside resources 
we also use outside providers when it is more cost effective 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications 
product modules are designed so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
a key strategy of ours is to reduce the need for customization of displays and increase standardization 
for example  we are developing a more widespread use of our dvx common module platform and are expanding use of standard formed cabinets for displays 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication among employee teams throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
we have manufacturing facilities in brookings  south dakota  sioux falls  south dakota  redwood falls  minnesota  victor  new york and shanghai  china 
locations outside of brookings  south dakota produce a material amount of our products 
during fiscal  we began reorganizing our plants to more closely align them with the five business units described above 
in fiscal and  we expanded this reorganization by allocating inventory and decentralizing various other functions to each plant 
this resulted in significant investment in replicating processes which in prior years were centralized 
this was extremely important given the rapid growth of the business and the resulting unique needs of our customers in each business unit 
our goal was to align sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing into a cohesive business unit with a focus on customers while not giving up the synergies of shared resources 
in addition  given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business  we need to maintain our ability to manufacture the same products across our plants so that we can smooth out the peaks and valleys of customer demand of the various business units 
during the second half of fiscal  as a result of the downturn in business  primarily in our commercial business  it became more important to share the plants across business units 
we expect that emphasis on aligning manufacturing to a business unit as opposed to a shared resource will continue to change as our business changes 
in fiscal  we began implementing lean manufacturing techniques throughout our manufacturing facilities 
since then we have placed significant emphasis on lean techniques in the non manufacturing areas 
although there are direct costs associated with implementing lean techniques  the goal of doing so is to eliminate waste and deliver products to a customer when the customer desires the products while maintaining minimal inventory and eliminating non value added tasks 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of standard displays and other state of the art display systems typically involves competitive proposals 
as a part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
we usually include  as a part of our proposal  site preparation and installation services related to the display system 
in these cases  we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a general contractor 
generally  we outsource all related electrical  steel and installation labor to qualified subcontractors with which we have developed relationships 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration and growth 
professional services we provide in addition to technical contracting include event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance  training on hardware and software  and display rentals 
our creative production staff provides a variety of services to customers  including video content  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our sports marketing division provides customers with marketing and ad sales for facilities to fund display system purchases 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  we render these services to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
we provide these services through our own employees located in company or home offices throughout the world in more than ten countries 
customer service and support 
our customer service distinguishes us from our competitors 
this service includes limited warranties for most of our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after the first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer  and extended service agreements 
we also provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our help desk with experienced technicians who are available on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair centers  located in the united states  germany and shanghai  are staffed with trained technicians who repair and return components that require service  and we offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
beginning in fiscal  we reorganized our north american field service personnel so that we could better focus on the commonality of the products across units rather than the unique needs of each customer  which was the prior focus 
we believe that we can drive significant cost savings and synergies by doing this that will be realized over time 
we also took steps to improve utilization of our field service personnel through the use of third party authorized service companies 
this allows us to better respond to changes in volume of service which peaks in the late summer and early fall 
general description of our products and technologies our display technologies have changed significantly since the mid s  when incandescent lamps were the primary display element 
presently  led and lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability of blue and green led in the mid s  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds as the primary colors to form all other colors in the video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for smaller displays have led to the addition of lcd displays 
driven by customer demand  we have enhanced our video display technology into mobile and modular technologies and high definition capabilities for various applications 
the cost  performance and availability of leds have made them the preferred display element for large displays as compared to alternatives such as incandescent and reflective technologies  most of which are obsolete or unproven 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred small display solution 
the vast majority of displays we sell today utilize led technology 
the two principal components of many of our systems are the display and the controller 
the controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
data can be transferred between the controller and local or remote displays 
local connections may use wire cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
standard and cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
the controller controls each of the pixels which are the dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 
most of our display technologies rely on one or more of our software products to manage and provide content for the display 
these software products range in complexity from scoring consoles  to the venus control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays  to the show control display control system that controls multi color displays and video displays  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content 
additionally  our visiconn control software is used to display targeted messages to specific audiences and to control large networks of digital displays 
complementary software  such as our dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and can be fully integrated into the control software 
our display systems range from small scoreboards and digit displays priced at under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  our product sales are either custom products or standard catalog scoreboards or displays 
historically  these standard catalog sales have accounted for less than of our total annual revenues 
our custom products are customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but are generally built using standard technology platforms 
in  we initiated various programs to reduce custom components in favor of much more standardized components that could be assembled to form products that are customized to the needs of the end users 
within each product family  we produce displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display  and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  for longer distance viewing  the light sources  or pixels  are larger and spaced farther apart 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment in which our products function 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following primary product families scoring and timing products for sports  primarily led scoreboards  related controllers and software  audio systems  primarily for sports venues  and related control systems  automated rigging and hoist products and related control systems  video display systems  including a full line of led technologies in various pixel pitches and display configurations  and associated control systems  architectural lighting and display elements  primarily our propixel freeform led products  message displays  promoted under the galaxy and galaxy pro names  and associated control systems  digital billboard displays  promoted under the valo product name  and associated control systems  digit and price displays and associated control systems  and transportation products  primarily the vanguard line of dynamic message signs 
each of these product families is described below 
scoring and timing products 
our line of scoring and timing products includes indoor and outdoor scoreboards for many different sports  digit displays  scoring and timing controllers  statistics software and other related products 
indoor systems range in complexity from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards  to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating video displays  message centers  advertising panels  hoist systems and control software 
outdoor scoreboards range in complexity from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to larger systems incorporating scoring  timing  video  message centers  advertising panels and control software 
we expect led technology will remain the technology of choice for scoreboards and displays due to its lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
because most of the scoreboards and display products within this group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal of delivering high quality products 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  a handheld controller for portable scoreboards  to the all sport series  designed for more sophisticated scoring systems and allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers communicate with scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections or other means 
we also offer timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
a primary component of these systems is our proven omnisport timing console 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors but also to interface with event management software created by third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
other timing system components include swimming touchpads  race start systems  and relay take off platforms 
as a key component of an integrated system  we market sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark 
the software allows entry and display of sports statistics and other information 
it is one of the leading applications of its type in collegiate and high school sports 
audio systems 
the audio system offerings include both standard and custom options 
standard audio systems are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of outdoor sports venues based on the size and configuration of the facility 
each of the standard outdoor systems includes control systems that feature digital signal processing for improved sound quality reproduction 
custom indoor and outdoor systems are also offered for larger venues and venues with unique seating configurations 
our sound systems are often integrated into an overall venue solution that includes scoring  timing  message display and or video capability 
automated rigging and hoist products 
the automated rigging and hoist product family includes our vortek automated hoists which complement our arena center hung scoreboard display systems for both small and large sporting facilities 
the hoist is an important part of an integrated solution for indoor venues that have center hung  suspended displays 
many of these hoist systems are customized based on the weight and design of the equipment being suspended  along with the load capacity of the building structure and attachment points within the facility 
additionally  we provide automated rigging for theatre applications  primarily in high schools and similar venues 
the strengths of our automated rigging systems include safety and ease of operation 
the theatre rigging control system includes intuitive touch screens and menus to control the integrated hoist systems for added safety and enhanced operation of a theatre production  making changes in scenery  lighting and sound preprogrammed  timed and easy to control 
video display systems 
this group consists primarily of displays  which are comprised of a large number of full color pixels capable of showing various levels of video  graphics and animation  and controllers  which manage the operation of the display 
video displays are comprised of red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
we offer a wide range of video display systems for different applications and budgets 
variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the resolution number of pixels of the displays  the brightness of the displays nits  the number of discrete colors that the display is able to produce color depth  and the viewing angles 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with virtually no limit to the size of display that can be built 
we offer a complete line of video display systems that is second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of displaying up to quadrillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as close as three millimeters 
currently  we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from six millimeter to millimeter 
the six millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance  and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with longer viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry  along with our proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures  provide uniform colors across the display 
in addition to traditional rectangular video displays  we have adapted led video technology into ribbon board displays and modular display systems 
our ribbon board display systems are configured in different height to width ratios to give arenas and stadiums the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in the facility 
for new construction projects  our prorail attachment system is combined with ribbon board technology to provide improved sight lines for fans and reduce construction costs for the building s owner 
digital ribbon boards generally serve as a revenue generation source for teams and facilities through advertising as well as another location to display information such as scoring and statistics 
our transportable display systems are comprised of lightweight individual led video panels less than a square meter in size that are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are used in what we refer to as mobile and modular applications  such as touring shows and the events market 
during the second half of fiscal  we introduced our dvx series outdoor video display technology 
this new generation of product is intended to replace our ps x and hd x display technology over time as we bring various configurations to the market 
the focus of this development was to standardize a common module and cabinet platform across all pixel pitches to gain synergies on materials  improve reliability  decrease selling prices and decrease engineering costs over the long term 
the primary control components for video displays in live event applications are show control  proprietary digital media players  and proprietary video processors 
these control components provide advanced capability for the display of live video and real time content on our displays 
during fiscal  we introduced the show control system described above 
this control system  which expands the capabilities of the venus controller  is designed to improve event management and display control 
show control can operate entire networks of displays from a single control interface with a more intuitive user interface 
features such as smart buttons allow users to instantly deliver media clips  camera feeds  and streaming information to any display in a network 
it also includes advanced scheduling tools to supplement the revenue generating use of displays 
daktronics digital media players store recorded video clips  and can function as a still store and character generator 
managed through our show controller software suite  the digital media player provides instant access to any video  animation  graphic and real time data files on the player 
it also controls the overall picture settings of any daktronics led display  making it the most feature rich product of its kind in the live events industry 
we also provide a proprietary video processing system developed specifically for led display technology 
for larger venues that host live events  the show control system  digital media player and video processor are typically part of a larger system that includes cameras  switchers and other components 
these systems provide the ability to show instant replays  live action video  pre recorded video clips  and overlays of scoring  timing and statistical information 
we sometimes package our components with control components from other suppliers to provide a complete video production solution 
architectural lighting and display products 
our line of propixel led architectural lighting and display products include our freeform video elements  which are available as individual pixels or strips of pixels that can be assembled and interconnected to transform structures into stunning visual landmarks 
flexible mounting platforms allow designers to transform structures into full motion video displays and to create various effects 
these elements can be structured in various resolutions depending on the application 
the freeform video elements are controlled by our various controllers  depending on the specific application 
message display systems 
the key product lines in this group are marketed under the names galaxy and galaxypro and are generally controlled with our venus display controller 
galaxy full matrix displays  available in both indoor and outdoor models  are our leading product line for commercial applications and are expected to be a key product line for growth in the future 
galaxy displays are red  amber or full color  with pixel spacing ranging from six millimeter to millimeter depending on color  size and viewing distance 
they are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to consumers 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
we offer various price points for displays within the galaxy line

the vanguard family of dynamic message displays are typically used to direct traffic and inform motorists 
these displays are used over freeways  on arterial roads  near bridges  at toll booths and in other locations 
we have also developed a control system for these displays to help transportation agencies manage large networks of displays 
our digit and directional displays are primarily marketed and sold for use in parking facilities 
they include multi line displays delivered in vertical cabinets  or drop in digit panels designed to be mounted in existing structures or signs 
most of the transportation products are designed and tested to rigorous transportation industry standards 
our personnel routinely work with standards development organizations to assist in writing standards that benefit the public and take advantage of the latest display technologies 
sources of raw materials we source some of our raw materials  including leds  power supplies  circuit boards and other components  from a limited number of suppliers  primarily due to quality control or the customized nature of the materials 
the loss of one of these key suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 
for additional information  refer to item a risk factors 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract  which generally does not exceed one year 
intellectual property we develop technology on a continuing basis that we consider for patent application 
we apply for the majority of our patents to establish the creation of the technology so that other parties cannot later claim ownership 
the remainder of our patents are designed to prevent infringement  and we aggressively pursue infringement claims for protection due to patent violations 
we apply for patents in the us and a limited number of foreign jurisdictions 
these patents generally pertain to our display technologies and product features and have various terms of duration 
the patents we hold which are designed to protect and prevent competitors from infringing include  for example  patents on mechanical designs  such as our prorail system and valo mount  formed cabinet design and latching system for modules 
they also include patents for product features and capabilities which we believe are superior in the marketplace and that give us a competitive position  such as our touchpad products for aquatics 
there are a limited number of patents that apply to our electronics due to the rapid rate of change in the industry 
however  we hold patents on such things as calibration methods and pixel arrangements 
due to the general nature of our business and the rapid rate of change in technology  we do not incur significant expenditures in defending or prosecuting patent claims 
we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve limited proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and other countries 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software  training and product manuals and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in object code to help preserve our intellectual property rights 
we also rely on nondisclosure and license agreements with our employees 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance that a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place  and large commercial systems and networks 
the seasonality of the sports market has also played a part in our sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  net sales and net income in the first and second quarters of a fiscal year tend to be higher than in the third quarter of a fiscal year  followed by higher levels in the fourth quarter 
the seasonality of the sports business is caused by sales related to facilities for football in the summer and early fall  followed by sales related to facilities for basketball and hockey in the fall  and facilities for baseball in the early to late spring 
this seasonal effect can be compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during our third fiscal quarter 
the effects of seasonality unrelated to holidays are generally not found in our commercial  international and transportation business units  although the impact of large orders in those markets and implications of weather during the winter months can cause fluctuations in net sales and profits 
approximately of our net sales are in the schools and theatres and live events business units  are in the commercial business unit  are in the international business unit  and the remaining approximately are in the transportation business unit 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than the gross margins on smaller orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on the majority of these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers live events large colleges and universities  professional sports teams and facilities  national and international sports games and federations  civic arenas and convention centers  staging and rental  and motor racing 
schools and theatres elementary and secondary schools  small colleges and universities  local recreation centers and theatres 
commercial retailers  outdoor advertisers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutuel racing and other similar businesses 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse customer base 
the nature of our business generally is not repetitive business from one or a few significant customers 
as a result  and except in the outdoor advertising component of our commercial business unit  the loss of a major customer generally would not have a material adverse impact on us 
backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of may  because sales agreements and purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or delay by customers with a limited or no penalty  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
although orders for many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
contracts related to new construction projects generally tend to have the longest lead times 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these laws and regulations include those that impose greater restrictions on electronic displays than on non electronic displays such as traditional billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our manufacturing operations use certain chemical products and chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable governmental laws and regulations 
in some countries in which we operate  including china  there are various laws and regulations that may inhibit our operations and financial condition 
these include restrictions or limitations on our ability to withdraw our capital investment  undeveloped legal frameworks to enforce our rights  and different levels of enforcement and consistency of laws 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established suppliers of competing products which may have greater market penetration in certain of our market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
there are generally more competitors in product categories and applications that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market and the text and graphics display markets 
as the needs of customers increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition is generally more intense 
within our standard product business  which includes our galaxy and valo display lines and scoreboard products  there are a large number of competitors  none of which we consider to be dominant 
in addition  in the galaxy and valo display business  there are a significant number of asian competitors that attempt to sell in our marketplace 
we generally compete based on our depth of service and the wide range of our product offerings 
within our large video system business  across all segments  there are various competitors that have different levels of strength in individual niches  but none that have a dominant position overall 
for example  a single competitor may have strength in the mobile video business but very little in the fixed installation business 
another competitor may have strength in the billboard display business but very little strength in any other large display applications 
in addition  our large display business has competitors in a narrow niche that were significant at one time in that niche and then substantially decreased their presence in that niche 
these changes seem to happen as a result of the complexities of the marketplace and the failures that are experienced on installations that receive a great deal of visibility 
our video systems are highly complex and visible  requiring a high standard of performance that is difficult for other industry participants to maintain over the long term 
our competitors are not generally aligned by business unit 
the focus of competitors tends to be more of a product focus 
for example  our galaxy line of displays has competitors that are also concentrated in the commercial business unit  although  like us  they also compete with these same products in our other business units 
competitors with a focus on video displays compete generally across all of our business units 
overall  we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery  and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  some of our competitors compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or less customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
research and development we believe our engineering capability and experience are unparalleled among our competitors and that our product development capability will continue to be a very important factor in our markets 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
environmental concerns our products and production processes require the storage  use and disposal of a variety of chemicals that are considered hazardous under applicable federal and state laws 
accordingly  we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements for the handling and disposal of such materials 
we do not anticipate any material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position due to compliance with government regulations involving environmental matters 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees and approximately part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately were in manufacturing  were in sales and marketing  were in customer service  were in engineering and were in general and administrative 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe employee relations are good 
financial information about geographic areas our operations in countries outside the us are accompanied by certain financial and other risks 
relationships with customers and terms of sale vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the us currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect net sales from  and the profitability of  operations outside the us we attempt to hedge these exposures to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on net earnings 
in addition  the repatriation of certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries may result in substantial us tax cost

item a 
risk factors a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower net sales and decreased margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets  some of which are highly fragmented 
we also compete against products produced in asia and other parts of the world  including the us  which in some cases are of lower quality or performance and lower cost 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance our existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products  or they may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and other resources than we do and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  which could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement  innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to make timely and cost effective product improvements  innovations and developments 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis 
almost all of the contracts we enter into to sell our products are on a fixed price basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed price contracts  our profits will be reduced 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or a delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit our recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
our ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control  which could adversely affect net sales and profits from international sales 
for fiscal years  and  revenue outside the united states represented approximately  and of our consolidated net sales  respectively 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been and may in the future be adversely affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries whether due to cultural  exchange rate or other factors  compliance with import export laws and foreign tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue and earnings 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond our control 
furthermore  because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
factors that could cause our operating results to vary also include new product introductions  variations in product and project mix  and delivery due date changes 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating results in one quarter may not be indicative of future operating results 
our products are covered by warranties  and fulfilling these warranties could adversely affect our financial results 
unanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less in the case of standard products and one year or less in the case of custom orders 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
large contracts with significant customers represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts and the size and timing of large contracts 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts  primarily in the professional and major college facilities market  the outdoor advertising niche and for large spectaculars around the world and the amounts and timing of these contracts 
whether we are awarded large contracts and their timing and amount could also cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings 
awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations  and if we default on our credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the terms and conditions of our credit facilities impose restrictions that limit  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions including cash dividends and create or incur liens 
the availability of credit facilities are also subject to certain covenants as explained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure that we will achieve operating results and maintain a financial position meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the facilities 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facilities and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any and all other amounts payable under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of our credit facilities 
we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act 
we are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act  which prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
foreign companies  including some of our competitors  are not subject to these prohibitions 
corruption  extortion  bribery  pay offs  theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in many jurisdictions  including the middle east and china 
if our competitors engage in these practices  they may receive preferential treatment from the personnel of some companies or governmental agencies  giving our competitors an advantage in securing business from these companies or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses  which would put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal  we cannot assure that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible even if we are not aware of such conduct 
if our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe penalties 
our operations in the people s republic of china china subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of china 
we have offices and make sales to customers in china 
under its current leadership  the government of china has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
however  the government of china may not continue to pursue such policies 
despite progress in developing its legal system  china does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws  particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade 
enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of them may be inconsistent 
as the chinese legal system develops  the promulgation of new laws  changes to existing laws and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors 
for example  china recently passed a unified enterprise income tax law  which changes and increases the income tax on foreign owned facilities 
china also enacted new labor laws that became effective january  that make it more difficult and expensive for companies to make changes in their workforce 
in addition  some government policies and rules are not published or communicated in local districts in a timely manner  if they are published at all 
if they are published  they may not be followed consistently by local districts 
as a result  we may inadvertently operate our business in violation of new rules and policies without having any knowledge of their existence 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us 
any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
our ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
it is anticipated that borrowings from our existing credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance our capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may make future acquisitions  which may be difficult to integrate  divert management resources  result in unanticipated costs or dilute our shareholders 
part of our business strategy is to make acquisitions of or investments in companies businesses  products or technologies that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities  or offer growth opportunities 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
additional risks associated with acquisitions include the following it may be difficult to integrate the purchased company  products  businesses or technologies into our own business  we may incur substantial unanticipated integration costs  it may be difficult  time consuming and costly to integrate management information and accounting systems of an acquired business into our current systems  assimilating the acquired businesses may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business  we may enter markets in which we have limited prior experience  acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired operations  we may have difficulty retaining or developing the acquired businesses customers  acquisitions could adversely affect our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  we may fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and or the anticipated strategic benefits of the acquisitions  and we may incur liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims  and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities or claims 
in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could incur debt  recognize amortization expenses related to intangible assets  recognize large and immediate write offs  assume liabilities  or issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage of ownership 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked  primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties  forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which our stock trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees  but we do maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming and divert management s attention from business 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights  which could be costly  time consuming and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
as the size of our markets increases and our product offerings continue to evolve and become more sophisticated  we are more likely to be subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive  and could divert our management s attention away from the execution of our business plan 
moreover  any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis  if at all  or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering  and our customers to continue using  our affected product 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our customers partners for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products to others 
infringement claims asserted against us or our vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we maintain inventory that is subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have an adverse impact on our future profits 
we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements  which may negatively affect our business and operating results 
we increase our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand 
market demand  however  has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level 
the underutilization that can result decreases our profitability 
for example  in fiscal and  market demand for our products was increasing rapidly  resulting in expanding our capacity 
in the second half of fiscal  net sales were below our expectations primarily due to a decline of orders in our commercial and international business units 
this resulted in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as a result  our profitability also was below our expectations 
the following factors complicate accurate capacity planning for market demand changes in the demand for and mix of products our customers buy  our ability to add and train our manufacturing staff in advance of demand  the market s pace of technological change  variability in our manufacturing productivity  and long lead times for most of our plant and equipment expenditures  requiring major financial commitments well in advance of actual production requirements 
a deterioration of our business could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  and we may need to impair certain assets in the future 
our inability to plan our capacity requirements accurately and efficiently utilize our production capacity  or our failure to put in place the technologies and capacity necessary to meet market demand  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we obtain some of our raw materials  including  but not limited to  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and plastics  from a limited number of suppliers 
if we cannot obtain some key raw materials from our suppliers  we cannot assure that the raw materials will be readily available from other suppliers  that other suppliers will agree to supply the materials to us on terms that are as favorable as the terms we currently receive  or that the raw materials from any other suppliers will be of adequate and consistent quality 
although we believe our supply of raw materials currently is adequate for the needs of our business  we cannot assure you that new sources of supply will be available when needed 
any interruption in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
general price increases or significant shortages of raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating margin 
we purchase large quantities of raw materials and components  including  but not limited to  aluminum  leds  power supplies  circuit boards and various other electronic components 
materials comprise the largest component of costs  representing nearly of the cost of sales in fiscal unless  to the extent described above  we have multiple sources of supply for many of our raw materials  significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials 
further increases in the price of these raw materials and components could further increase our product costs and materially adversely affect margins 
although we attempt to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to customers  we may decide not to do so for competitive reasons 
even when our price increases are successful  the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind the incurrence of higher costs 
as of june  there were no material parts shortages in the market place that were impacting our business  however  the lead times from suppliers has in some cases increased  and we continue to monitor events which could lead to disruptions and price increases  such as the earthquake in japan in march if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be inadequate  our financial results may not be accurate  raising concerns for investors and potentially adversely affecting our stock price 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the fiscal years ended april   may  and may  and will continue to do so for future periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements  and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  from our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  our assessment of our internal controls may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors and therefore adversely affect our stock price 
our manufacturing would be interrupted if we were unable to use one of our manufacturing facilities 
we manufacture most of our products in two locations in south dakota and one in minnesota 
in addition  we are increasing the amount of product manufactured in our china facility 
if any of these facilities  or a part thereof  were to be destroyed  shut down or unable to be used for its intended purposes  we would be limited in our capacity to meet customer demands until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  was found 
the replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart 
the delay engendered by  and the potential cost incurred in  these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the protections we have adopted may discourage takeover offers favored by our shareholders 
we have adopted  and there are available under the south dakota business corporation act sd act  several provisions that could have the effect of discouraging takeover offers 
of the  shares of capital stock authorized in our articles of incorporation   shares are undesignated 
our board of directors may issue the undesignated shares on terms and with the rights  preferences and designations determined by the board without shareholder action  which could be used to discourage takeover attempts 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
a classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that provides for the exercise of preferred share purchase rights when a person becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  we are governed by the anti takeover provisions of the current sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the sd act also limits the voting rights of shares acquired in specified types of acquisitions and restricts specified types of business combinations 
the existence or issuance of blank check stock  the classified board  the existence of our shareholder rights plan and the effect of the anti takeover provisions of the sd act  individually or in the aggregate  may discourage potential takeover attempts and delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
they also may make the removal of management more difficult  which could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
significant changes in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation claims against us 
significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies generally 
the price of our common stock has changed significantly in the past and is likely to continue to experience significant changes in the future 
in the past  securities litigation claims have been filed against certain companies following a period of decline in the market price of their publicly traded securities 
we may be the target of similar securities litigation claims in the future 
risks associated with litigation often are difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
although we maintain directors and officers insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim  and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured 
future litigation  if any  may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
difficult conditions in the capital  credit and commodities markets and in the overall economy could continue to materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flow  and we do not know ifthese conditions will improve in the near future 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flow could continue to be materially adversely affected by the current and continuing difficult conditions and volatility in the capital  credit and commodities markets and in the overall worldwide economy 
these factors  combined with the prior declines in business and consumer confidence and higher unemployment  have precipitated a worldwide economic slowdown 
although these conditions appear to have improved  the continuing impact that these factors might have on us and our business is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 
current economic conditions have accentuated each of the risks described in this annual report on form k and magnified their potential negative effect on us and our business 
the difficult conditions in these markets and the overall economy affect our business in a number of ways 
for example although we believe we have sufficient liquidity under our credit agreement with a bank to run our business  under extreme market conditions  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available or sufficient and  in such a case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
market volatility has exerted downward pressure on our stock price  which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital in the future 
economic conditions could continue to result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties or electing to limit spending because of the declining economy  which may result in decreased net sales and earnings for us 
economic conditions combined with the weakness in the credit markets could continue to lead to increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
if the markets in which we participate experience further economic downturns  as well as a slow recovery period  this could continue to negatively impact our sales and revenue generation  margins and operating expenses  and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not know if market conditions or the state of the overall economy will improve in the near future or when or how quickly improvement will occur 
circumstances could arise in which our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired  causing us to recognize substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
we have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions to complement and expand our existing businesses  increase our revenues and profitability  and expand our markets 
as a result of prior acquisitions  we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets on an ongoing basis  and we may incur substantial non cash impairment charges  which would adversely affect our financial results 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of such reviews in the future will not result in substantial impairment charges 
impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices  costs  holding periods or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
a decline in our market capitalization or in our estimated forecasted discounted cash flows also could result in an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a non cash impairment charge could materially and adversely affect the net income for the reporting period in which it is recorded 
our data systems could fail or their security could be compromised 
our business operations depend on the reliability of sophisticated data systems 
any failure of these systems  or any breach of our systems security measures  could adversely affect our operations  at least until our data can be restored and or the breaches remediated

item properties our principal real estate properties are located in areas we deem necessary to meet sales  service and operating requirements 
we consider all of the properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet current and near term operating requirements 
as of april   we leased approximately facilities throughout the united states and facilities outside the united states for sales and service offices 
we also leased one facility in sioux falls  south dakota  comprising approximately  square feet 
the lease contains an option to purchase the building from january  through december  our china subsidiary leases approximately  square feet in a building in shanghai for sales  service and manufacturing 
the majority of the remaining sales and service offices located throughout the united states  canada  europe and china are small offices  generally consisting of less than  square feet leased under operating leases 
these lease obligations expire on various dates  with the longest commitment extending to fiscal we believe all of our leases will be renewable at market terms in our discretion as they become due or that suitable alternative space will be available to lease under similar terms and conditions 
we own various buildings in brookings  south dakota  totaling approximately  square feet  and a building in redwood falls  minnesota  totaling approximately  square feet

overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on markets  geographical regions and products 
the primary five markets consist of live events  commercial  schools and theatres  international and transportation 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sport facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales and gross profit percentages also have fluctuated due to other seasonality factors  including the impact of weather and holidays  which primarily affect our third quarter 
our gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
orders are booked and included in backlog only upon receipt of a firm contract and after receipt of any required deposits 
as a result  certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be booked until all required contractual documents and deposits are received 
in addition  order bookings can vary significantly as a result of the timing of large orders 
we operate on a to week fiscal year  with our fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
when april falls on a wednesday  the fiscal year ends on the preceding saturday 
the years ended april   may  and may  consisted of  and weeks  respectively 
within each fiscal year  each quarter is comprised of week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year 
in each week year  each of the last three quarters is comprised of a week period  and an additional week is added to the first quarter of that fiscal year 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on our financial results  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report  and the section of this item entitled recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term construction type contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term construction type contracts 
earnings on construction type contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
indirect costs include charges for such items as facilities  engineering  and project management 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are capable of being estimated 
generally  construction type contracts we enter into have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete construction type contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine these estimates 
we combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective  essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a customer  involve interrelated construction activities  and are performed concurrently or sequentially 
when a group of contracts is combined  revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined projects 
we segment revenues in accordance with contract segmenting criteria in accounting standards codification asc  construction type and production type contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in customers ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of april  and may   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million and million  respectively 
warranties 
we have recognized a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated warranty costs  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine our reserve for warranties 
as of april  and may   we had approximately million and million reserved for these costs  respectively 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we recognize deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare that to the deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine estimated costs under these agreements 
as of april  and may   we had million and million of deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements  respectively 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary changes are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which they occur 
in determining market value  we review various factors such as current inventory levels  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the estimated market value of inventory 
however  if market conditions change  including changes in technology  product components used in our products or in expected sales  we may be exposed to unforeseen losses that could be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense  as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we review deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  and for those not expecting to be realized  we have recognized a valuation allowance 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not met  a valuation allowance for some of these deferred tax assets would be required 
we believe that we will generate taxable income in future years which will allow for realization of deferred tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets would require approximately million of taxable income  which we believe is achievable 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international  and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we record our income tax provision based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including the existing tax laws  the status of any current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures consistent with asc  income taxes 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that any potential tax assessments from various tax authorities that are not covered by our income tax provision will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
we have not recorded us deferred income taxes on certain of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings  as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
however  should we change our business and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of our us subsidiaries  including cash maintained by these non us subsidiaries  additional non us tax liabilities would be incurred 
it is not practical at this time to estimate the amount of additional us tax liabilities we would incur 
some of the countries in which we are located allow tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted which in some cases could occur if we fail to satisfy the conditions on which such holidays or incentives are based  they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
it is anticipated that tax holidays and incentives with respect to our chinese operations will expire within the next three years 
however  due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations  we are unable to predict how these expirations will impact us in the future 
in addition  any acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase  depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located 
asset impairment carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review involves the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level that requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
indicators such as adverse business conditions  economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired 
carrying values for long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment reviews are conducted when we believe that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of negative operating cash flow  or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may trigger an impairment review 
the company s initial impairment review to determine if a potential impairment charge is required is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and discount rates 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes standard option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding other variables  including projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected volatility of our stock price in future periods and expected dividend yield 
we analyze historical employee exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption of a new employee option 
we believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option 
the risk free interest rate we use is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock price in future periods by using the implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use expected volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options for our common stock and our assessment that expected volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use an expected dividend yield consistent with our dividend yield over the period of time we have paid dividends in the black scholes option valuation model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data  and we revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net earnings and net earnings per share in a future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   may  and may  year ended april  may  may  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales the following table sets forth net sales and orders by business unit for fiscal years ended april   may  and may  year ended april  may  may  net sales amount percent change amount percent change amount commercial live events schools theatres transportation international orders commercial live events schools theatres transportation international fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial business unit 
the commercial business unit is comprised of the reseller and national account business  which includes primarily our galaxy and galaxypro displays and large custom contracts for commercial facilities  and the outdoor advertising business  which is primarily sales of our digital billboard technology to outdoor advertising companies 
net sales in our outdoor advertising business  which is a component of the commercial business unit  were up compared to fiscal orders in the outdoor advertising business were up approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal in addition to better economic conditions in fiscal compared to fiscal for outdoor advertisers  during the first quarter of fiscal  we were successful in earning back business from a large outdoor advertising company that had not placed significant orders with us during fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  two of the large outdoor advertising companies in the united states announced their plans for an increase in digital billboard deployments beginning in the first calendar quarter of these plans  in addition to the improving economy benefiting other outdoor advertising companies  have caused both orders and sales to rise 
we also believe that our ability to maintain our market share as we earned back a large customer has been helped by the industry s acceptance of our series digital billboard product 
although the number of digital displays deployed in calendar may approximate numbers we experienced on an annual basis prior to the economic downturn  the ultimate level of net sales dollars will be significantly lower than at that time due to the lower unit selling prices for digital billboards 
it is important to note that the outdoor advertising business has a number of constraints in addition to the current economic conditions  primarily the challenges of achieving adequate returns on investments on digital displays  which limit locations suitable for digital displays  and regulatory constraints  which limit where displays can be installed 
furthermore  a large part of our business in this area is obtained from two customers  and therefore a loss of one of those customers could have a significant adverse impact on this portion of our business 
net sales in the reseller portion of the commercial business unit increased by approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  while orders increased by approximately 
the increase in both orders and net sales has been primarily driven by an increase in the large contract portion of this business  which includes spectaculars and other large video display systems 
this has been augmented by the introduction of our architectural lighting products which we expect to help drive increased sales 
our standard product sales and services business were up slightly  which we attribute to improving economic conditions 
the level of large custom contract orders and sales in this niche is subject to volatility as described in prior filings  and therefore orders could decline in future periods  although we continue to see a growing number of opportunities 
furthermore  this business unit is sensitive to economic conditions  and the future performance of this business unit will vary based on these conditions 
as a result of the worsening economic and credit environments in early fiscal  the competitive pressures in the commercial business unit increased as competitors went after fewer opportunities 
this competitive pressure has continued to put considerable pricing pressure on all aspects of this business unit 
in addition to these competitive pressures  the current economic conditions have caused many customers to hold off or delay orders 
these factors have also had an adverse impact on our gross margins 
subject to the foregoing  our commercial business unit generally benefits from increasing product acceptance  lower cost of displays  our distribution network and a stronger advertising market 
in the past  the seasonality of the outdoor advertising niche has been a factor in the fluctuation of our net sales over the course of a fiscal year because the deployment of displays slows in the winter months in the northern united states 
generally  seasonality is not a material factor in the rest of the commercial business 
live events business unit 
the changes in net sales and orders for the live events business unit for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a number of factors 
the most significant positive factor was the improvement in orders for professional baseball facilities 
we were awarded over million in contracts exceeding million for major league baseball facilities during the second and third quarters of fiscal compared to none for the same periods in fiscal these baseball contracts  plus one additional contract booked in late fiscal  contributed over million in net sales in fiscal this increase from the baseball contracts was offset by a decline in large contracts over million in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales on contracts in excess of million declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline is primarily due to decreasing new construction projects as discussed in prior filings 
since the third quarter of fiscal  when the economy caused a significant decline in orders and sales in the live events business unit  we have began to see some improvement in this business unit 
in spite of this improvement  the growth outlook for orders related to the fall sports facilities remains uncertain 
as described below  a portion of this concern is due to the current labor situation in professional sports 
we believe that the economy  as well as the competitive factors described below  are still impacting this business adversely 
as we progress through the first quarter of fiscal  we should obtain greater clarity on the fall sports business performance and fiscal year as a whole 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see more significant competitive pressure in the live events marketplace 
we believe that this pressure continues to hurt gross profit margins 
in addition  over the next months  a number of professional sports leagues are expected to be renegotiating labor contracts with players  which could negatively impact orders during this period 
until these pressures are reduced or eliminated  they are likely to adversely affect our ability to book orders and our gross profit margin 
partially offsetting this impact on gross margin has been the impact of the lower cost of our equipment resulting from our new product offerings 
these factors  primarily the competitive factors  make it difficult to forecast orders and net sales in the live events business unit for fiscal although our live events business is typically resistant to economic conditions  the severity of the current economic environment impacts this business 
however  over the long term  we expect to see growth  assuming that the economy continues to improve and we are successful at counteracting competitive pressures 
our expectations regarding additional growth over the long term in large sports venues is due to a number of factors  including facilities tending to spend more on larger display systems  our product and services offerings  which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry  and our field sales and service network  which is important to support our customers 
in addition  we benefit from the competitive nature of sports teams  which strive to out perform their competitors with display systems 
this impact has been and is expected to continue to be a driving force in increasing transaction sizes in new construction and major renovations 
growth in the large sports venues is also driven by the desire for high definition video displays  which typically drives larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size 
these increases  however  have been partially offset by the decline in product selling prices 
we also believe that the effects of an adverse economy are generally less on sports related business as compared to our other businesses as evidenced by periods of poor economic downturns that occurred prior to calendar year we believe that the adverse economic conditions that have existed over the last couple of years were deep enough to adversely impact our sports business in a significant way 
net sales in our sports marketing and mobile and modular portion of this market were less than and of total net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and therefore were not material 
schools and theatres business unit 
the changes in net sales in the schools and theatres business unit in fiscal compared to fiscal were the result of higher custom video and scoring systems due to more opportunities created by our sports marketing business and the increased demand for large video systems  offset by declines in our standard scoreboard  display and hoist product sales 
we believe that the volatility in the sports portion of this business unit is due to reasons similar to the decline in net sales for the live events business 
in addition  we believe that although much of the spending on small sports systems derives from advertising revenues  the declining school budgets has had an adverse impact on orders in this business unit 
a positive aspect of the orders has been the increase in opportunities for larger video systems  primarily in high school facilities which benefit from our sports marketing services that generate the advertising revenue to fund the display systems 
the increased interest in this area has lead to a slightly higher level of orders in fiscal as compared to fiscal although it is difficult to project  we believe that fiscal could continue to be a challenge for the schools and theatres business unit due to the foregoing reasons 
net sales for the rigging portion of this business unit decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal for the long term  we believe that this business unit presents growth opportunities once the outlook for school spending improves 
transportation business unit 
the increase in net sales in the transportation business unit for fiscal was due to the reduction in backlog that existed at the beginning of the fiscal year  which was higher than normal 
orders were down slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a couple of unusually large orders booked in the second half of fiscal  including one order in excess of million for an east coast transit authority 
the decline in backlog resulted from improvements in throughput of our manufacturing during late fiscal we believe that the past and future growth in this business unit is the result of federal government stimulus money and other legislation that provides for increased spending on transportation projects and to us gaining market share 
we expect that net sales in the transportation business unit will be relatively flat for fiscal similar to other business units  it appears that the competitive environment has become more intense in this area as a limited number of competitors have become more aggressive in pricing 
although we expect that this pricing pressure is not sustainable  it is likely to have an adverse impact on our net sales and gross profit margins until it eases 
international business unit 
the increase in net sales in the international business unit during fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the backlog at the beginning of fiscal and the increase in orders throughout fiscal included in orders in fiscal is a large project in excess of million for a new arena in mexico 
overall  we have made considerable investments in growing our business internationally  where we do not have the same market share as we do domestically 
we believe that as the economy has improved  our orders have increased as we continued to develop a local presence in foreign markets 
as stated in prior filings  in the second half of fiscal  we began to see more competitive pressures in this area similar to the competitive pressures described above in the live events market because the competitors tend to overlap 
in spite of the foregoing  it appears that this market is seeing some strengthening  as our opportunities began to increase in late fiscal and orders are rising 
however  as a result of the competitive pressures  we expect to continue to see more challenges to gross profit to win orders 
advertising revenues 
we occasionally sell products in exchange for the advertising revenues generated from the use of our display products 
these sales represented less than of net sales for fiscal and the gross profit percent on these transactions has typically been higher than the gross profit percent on other transactions of similar size  although the selling expenses associated with these transactions are typically higher 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year commercial business unit 
in the early part of the third quarter of fiscal  we were notified that our largest customer in our outdoor advertising niche was decreasing its spending on digital billboards from approximately million annually to approximately million annually  effective for calendar year we were one of two primary vendors of digital billboards for this customer 
this corresponded to a decline in orders overall in the outdoor advertising niche  which started to become evident late in the second quarter of fiscal it is our belief that the then current economic conditions and limited credit availability caused this decline 
this decline in digital billboard sales was the most significant factor in the decline in sales and orders in fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales in this niche digital billboards for outdoor advertisers in fiscal decreased by approximately million  or more than  as compared to fiscal the reseller and national account portion of the commercial business unit decreased approximately million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in the reseller niche for fiscal was due to a lower level of sales of standard galaxy displays as well as a decline in sales of large video display systems 
we attributed the decline in sales of galaxy displays to the weaker economic conditions in fiscal as compared to the same period of fiscal finally  the decrease in net sales in the national account portion was due to declines by our larger accounts due to a slow down in their deployment and decreases in new stores 
orders and sales were impacted by aggressive competition  causing customers to hesitate and evaluate opportunities more carefully 
order bookings were also down as indicated above for the same reasons as net sales 
live events business unit 
the decrease in net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a decline in revenues from large new construction contracts exceeding million as explained in prior filings  which had led to the significant growth during fiscal these large contracts contributed approximately million in net sales during fiscal compared to approximately million during fiscal in addition  orders and net sales were less than expected in fiscal as a result of orders being delayed and customers not moving forward with projects 
we believe this was due to economic concerns and various other factors causing customers to put off large expenditures 
the decrease in orders was due to the decrease in large orders and competitive pressures  which we believe caused us to lose orders we otherwise would have earned  and various other factors  all as explained above 
schools and theatres business unit 
net sales in this business unit declined in fiscal compared to as a result of decreases in orders in the sports portion of this business unit  which were partially offset by increasing net sales and orders in the hoist portion of this business unit 
we believe that the decline in the sports portion of the business unit was due to reasons similar to live events 
in addition  we believe that although much of the spending on small sports systems derives from advertising revenues  the impact of declining school budgets had an adverse impact on this business unit  which seemed to have worsened in the fourth quarter of fiscal transportation business unit 
the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to was due to the larger backlog of orders at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the beginning of fiscal the increases in orders in this business unit were due  in part  to a large order for the new jersey transit authority of approximately million  which is the guaranteed portion of a procurement contract of up to million over a five year period 
international business unit 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to was attributable  in part  to large orders booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal for a rail station in beijing and a network of displays in the uk that converted to net sales in the first quarter of fiscal due to the focus on large contracts in this business unit and the small number of contracts actually booked  volatility is not unusual 
as stated above  in the second half of fiscal  we began to see more competitive pressures in this area similar to the competitive pressures in the live events market because the competitors tend to overlap 
we believe that this had an adverse impact on our order bookings in fiscal backlog our backlog at the end of fiscal was million as compared to million at the end of fiscal overall  the increase in backlog is the result of the increase in orders in the international and commercial business units in fiscal as compared to net sales 
orders in the international business unit outpaced net sales by approximately million  and orders in the commercial business unit outpaced net sales by more than million 
these increases were partially offset by declines in backlog in the other business units 
backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders  and significant variations can be expected  as explained previously 
in addition  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also as explained previously 
gross profit year ended april  may  may  gross profit percent change as a percent of net sales gross profit percent change as a percent of net sales gross profit as a percent of net sales commercial live events schools theatres transportation international fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher net sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of an improved gross profit on our services business and a lower conversion cost of manufacturing as a percentage of sales  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately two percentage points in gross profit on product sales  primarily large contract sales  and higher warranty costs as a percentage of net sales 
the decline in large contract gross profit percentage was primarily due to the competitive factors described above 
gross profit percentages were relatively flat in fiscal and fiscal on small contract sales 
large contracts were approximately of net sales in fiscal  compared to approximately in fiscal warranty costs were approximately of net sales for fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we have been challenged with higher than expected warranty costs for the past two fiscal years 
during fiscal  in order to reduce these costs  we began expending significant effort on developing  and brought to market in late fiscal  our new outdoor dvx technology  which is a common module platform that over time will replace the different and unique modules for each of our display resolutions and types 
we have also invested significant resources in quality initiatives and reliability equipment to test new designs 
we believe that this technology and investments in quality initiatives will drive down warranty costs over the long term 
one of the more significant trends that we have been experiencing since the middle of fiscal is the high level of fixed costs as a percentage of sales within manufacturing 
we believe that as our business rebounds and sales grow  we will gain leverage in our gross profit percentage due to these fixed costs 
as a result of long term sales growth expectations  we have not decreased the fixed cost infrastructure  as that would impair our ability to respond to rising sales in the future 
this has caused fixed costs to be higher than the levels we would prefer as a percent of sales 
total manufacturing conversion costs for fiscal and fiscal were approximately million and million  respectively 
this equates to of net sales in fiscal as compared to of net sales in fiscal within the commercial business unit  the gross profit percentage increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an improved margin on services related sales  which added approximately one percentage point to gross profit and improved manufacturing conversion costs  as described previously 
this increase was partially offset by higher warranty costs  which caused a one half of a percentage point decline in gross profit percentage 
although we expect that warranty costs within the commercial business unit will decline  causing an increase in gross profit percent due to the competitive factors mentioned above  it is difficult to forecast gross profit percentage on products and therefore gross profit as a whole in this business unit 
there are factors  however  such as lower component costs  that suggest that gross profit can increase on an aggregate basis 
gross profit percentage in the live events business unit decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower margins on large contracts  which caused the gross profit percent to decline by approximately four percentage points  partially offset by improvements in manufacturing conversion costs and an improvement in gross profit percent on services 
the lower gross profit percent on contracts is attributable to the competitive factors described above 
based on our current backlog and competitive factors  we expect to see improvements in the gross profit percent on a sequential basis as a result of the factors explained previously related to the lower costs of the products  however  gross profit percent in the large contract business can vary to a large degree and are difficult to forecast 
gross profit percentage in the schools and theatres business unit increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of improvements in manufacturing conversion costs as a percent of sales  which were partially offset by lower gross profit percents on equipment sales in the sports portion of this business unit 
gross profit percentage in our transportation business unit increased in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately three percentage points as a result of the improvement in manufacturing conversion costs as previously described 
within the international business unit  gross profit percents increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an improvement in manufacturing conversion costs as previously described 
it is difficult to project gross profit levels for fiscal because of the uncertainty regarding the level of sales  warranty costs and the competitive factors described previously 
however  we expect that gross profit could increase assuming that changes in the competitive dynamics do not change in an adverse way and that warranty costs decrease as a percentage of net sales 
this expectation is also dependant on other factors as described in our risk factors section of the annual report 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower net sales 
gross margin percents on large contracts decreased during fiscal by approximately percentage points over fiscal as a result of competitive factors 
the largest impact in terms of declines in percentage points was in the live events business unit  where gross profits declined on large contracts by percentage points 
gross profit percents were flat year over year for standard orders 
in fiscal  large contracts comprised approximately of net sales  while standard orders comprised approximately 
overall contracts and standard orders gross profit percents declined by approximately one percentage point 
warranty costs declined as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal as opposed to in the prior fiscal year 
the costs of excess capacity caused a percentage point decline in gross profit 
other items such as inventory writedowns and other variances comprised the remainder of the difference 
included in warranty costs in fiscal were a number of significant and isolated warranty costs that did not recur in fiscal that were explained in prior filings 
within the commercial business unit  gross profit percent decreased approximately five percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a decline in margin in all niches 
the majority of the decline was in the billboard niche as a result of competitive factors  higher warranty costs and greater excess capacity in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit percent declined in the live events business unit  primarily as a result of the competitive factors and the lower level of sales during the year described above  which resulted in higher costs of excess capacity 
gross profit percent in our schools and theaters business unit increased as a result of improved performance in our hoist business  which was offset partially by a decline in gross profit percent in our small sports facilities business  resulting primarily from higher manufacturing variances 
gross profit percent in our transportation business unit increased in fiscal compared to as a result of better margin achievement on orders in spite of the competitive factors 
within the international business unit  gross profit percent increased in fiscal compared to as a result of lower warranty costs as a percentage of sales 
operating expenses year ended april  may  may  operating expense percent change as a percent of sales operating expense percent change as a percent of sales operating expense as a percent of sales selling expense general and administrative product design and development gain on insurance proceeds goodwill impairment fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses are comprised of selling  general and administrative expenses and product design and development costs 
the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
as a result of the downturn in orders and net sales that started during the second quarter of fiscal  we began to reduce all types of operating expenses to partially keep pace with the declining net sales 
although we will continue efforts to reduce costs  we have reached a point where further reductions are unlikely on an aggregate basis and  in fact  we have begun to invest in certain areas in which we previously suspended or reduced investments 
we continue to challenge and explore areas for reductions and improvements 
our most significant costs within operating expense are personnel related costs 
our approach prior to fiscal was focused on allowing attrition and limited reductions in workforce  coupled with a general hiring freeze  to drive a significant portion of the decrease in personnel costs 
in addition  we implemented a wage freeze for salaried employees and various other cost reduction initiatives in fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal were down from the level of fiscal  the year the downturn began for us 
we removed the wage freeze beginning in fiscal and in late fiscal started to increase staffing in a limited number of areas 
in addition  certain other cost reduction initiatives that were temporary in nature have been reinstated during fiscal based on the foregoing  it is likely that total operating costs will increase in future quarters  although we will maintain a conservative approach until sales and gross profit increase more materially 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
all areas of operating expenses on a year to date basis were impacted because the first quarter of fiscal included weeks as opposed to the more common weeks of the first quarter of fiscal selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment expenses  facilities related costs for sales and service offices  and expenditures for marketing efforts  including the costs of collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a decrease in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of approximately million  a decrease of million of depreciation  and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
these savings were offset by increases of million in travel and entertainment costs  a million increase in costs of conventions  a million increase in commission and consultants  and an increase in other costs of million 
the decrease in personnel costs was the result of the lower number of employees caused by the reduction efforts explained above and decreases in benefits due to a change in health insurance plans 
the increase in travel and entertainment costs was a reflection of the higher level of sales opportunities and costs of conventions 
the decline in bad debt expense in fiscal was due to two larger isolated reserves established in fiscal the increase in costs of conventions was a result of higher costs incurred on trade shows attended 
depreciation costs declined as a result of a lower level of demonstration equipment 
as described above  we expect that selling expenses may increase in future quarters  although our goal is to continue to challenge our cost structure until our operating margin returns to more reasonable levels 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a decrease in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of approximately million  a decrease of million in travel and entertainment costs  a million decrease in costs of conventions  a million decrease in depreciation  and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
the decrease in personnel costs was the result of the lower number of employees caused by the reduction efforts explained above 
the decrease in travel and entertainment costs was a reflection of the lower number of employees and the lower level of sales opportunities 
the decrease in costs of conventions was a result of lower number of trade shows attended and decreased costs of those where attendance was appropriate 
depreciation costs declined as a result of a lower level of demonstration equipment 
the decline in bad debt expense was due to a lower level of credit losses occurring in fiscal  which is difficult to attribute to specific factors 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  training costs  amortization of intangibles and the costs of supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in general and administrative costs was the result of a decrease of approximately million in personnel costs  including benefits and taxes  lower costs related to hardware and software infrastructure  including depreciation  which decreased million  and lower professional fees  which decreased by approximately million 
the decreases were offset by an increase of million in computer software  hardware  and maintenance costs 
the lower level of personnel costs was the result of the reductions in employees in prior years as described above 
the lower level of professional fees was due to the decreased audit and tax fees 
as described above  we expect that general and administrative expenses may increase slightly in future quarters  although our goal is to continue to challenge our cost structure until our operating margin returns to more reasonable levels 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in general and administrative costs was the result of a decrease of approximately million in personnel costs  including benefits and taxes  lower costs related to hardware and software infrastructure  including depreciation  which decreased million  lower professional fees  which decreased by approximately million  and lower costs related to recruiting and other expenses 
the lower level of personnel costs was the result of the reductions in employees described above 
the lower level of professional fees was due to the higher level of litigation and contract negotiation fees in fiscal representing isolated items 
the lower recruiting fees resulted from the elimination of new full time hires in fiscal as compared to fiscal product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year investments in our dvx technology platform  architectural lighting products  various other initiatives to standardize display components and in other display technologies and related items  including control systems for both single site displays and networked displays  continue to drive product design and development expenses 
our costs for product development represent an allocated amount of costs based on time charges  materials costs and overhead of our engineering departments 
generally  between and of our engineering time is spent on product development  while the rest is allocated to large contract work and included in cost of goods sold 
the decline in product design and development expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a decrease of million in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  and a decrease of approximately million in depreciation expenses within our engineering departments 
as described above  we expect that product design and development expenses may increase slightly in future quarters  although our goal is to continue to challenge our cost structure until our operating margin returns to more reasonable levels 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year investments in our dvx technology and various other initiatives to standardize display components and in other display technologies and related items  including control systems for both single site displays and networked displays  drove increases in product design and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal we also invested in other product lines  including our galaxy display technology 
additionally  in fiscal we invested heavily in initiatives designed to improve manufacturing processes and decrease the cost of our products 
gain on insurance proceeds during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a gain on insurance proceeds of million related to the fire at our star circuits manufacturing facility as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds from the insurance company were used to purchase replacement equipment  inventory and supplies  offset the extra expense of outsourcing this manufacturing  and building out a new facility to house the operations 
goodwill impairment during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our schools and theaters and international business units 
the charge was approximately million for each business unit 
there was no similar impairment expense in prior fiscal years 
the impairment resulted from our analysis of goodwill  which factored in the unexpected decline in forecasted discounted cash flows 
we attributed the decline to the weaker economic conditions and the continued decline in our stock price 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information  including estimates and assumptions we used to determine this charge 
contribution margin by segment the following table sets forth contribution margin  defined as gross profit less selling expenses  by segment year ended april  may  may  contribution margin amount percent change amount percent change amount commercial live events schools theatres transportation international contribution margin by segment is equal to gross profit less selling costs  which includes allocations of various expenses on a discretionary basis that may not be indicative of the segment s actual performance on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we caution reaching conclusions as to performance based on these disclosures  which are required under generally accepted accounting principles 
all business units results were impacted as a result of the changes in sales and gross profit as previously described 
the remainder of the changes for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from changes in selling expense 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in the commercial business unit  selling expenses were down approximately for fiscal compared to fiscal the changes for the fiscal year were primarily due to lower personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of million and lower depreciation costs of million  partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs of million and various other expenses 
in the live events business unit  selling expenses declined by for fiscal compared to fiscal the decline for the quarter was the result of a million decrease in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  and a million decrease in depreciation  which was partially offset by an increase in various other expenses 
selling expenses for the schools and theatres business unit declined by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was the result of lower sales administration costs of million  lower personnel costs  including benefits and taxes  of million  lower bad debt expenses of approximately million and lower commission expense paid to third parties of million 
in the transportation business unit  selling expenses were generally flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal in the international business unit  selling expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the increase in commissions to third parties of million  an increase in travel and entertainment of approximately million  and an increase in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation of approximately million  and a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in the commercial business unit  selling expenses were down approximately for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease for the fiscal year to date were primarily due to lower personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of million  lower travel and entertainment costs of million  lower depreciation costs of million  lower bad debt expenses of million  lower commission expense paid to third parties of million and decreases in various other expenses 
in the live events business unit  selling expenses declined by for fiscal compared to fiscal the decline for the quarter was the result of a million decrease in personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  lower travel and entertainment costs of million  lower commission expense paid to third parties of million and lower bad debt expenses of million 
selling expenses for the schools and theatres business unit declined by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was the result of lower personnel costs  including benefits and taxes  of million  lower travel and entertainment costs of million  and lower depreciation costs of million 
in the transportation business unit  selling expenses declined by for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease for the fiscal year to date were primarily due to lower personnel costs  including taxes and benefits  of million  lower travel and entertainment costs of million  lower depreciation costs of million 
in the international business unit  selling expenses were generally flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal interest income and expense we occasionally generate interest income through product sales on an installment basis  under lease arrangements or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays  which result in long term receivables 
we also invest excess cash in short term temporary cash investments and marketable securities that generate interest income 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest costs on long term marketing obligations 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was the result of higher levels of temporary cash investments and an increase in interest income recognized on long term receivables 
we expect that the amount of interest income will increase in fiscal due to higher levels of interest income we anticipate receiving as we invest excess cash into higher yielding investments  although due to the volatility of working capital needs and changes in investing and financing activities  this expectation could prove to be incorrect 
interest expense remained flat at million in fiscal and fiscal we expect that interest expense will remain at relatively low levels for fiscal fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was the result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher levels of temporary cash investments 
interest expense remained flat at million in fiscal and fiscal income taxes fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income tax expense benefit increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective rate for fiscal was approximately as compared to in fiscal included in income tax expense for fiscal was the impact of the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit which was signed by the president in late calendar year this reduced our income tax expense by approximately million  as the reinstatement was retroactive to january  had this benefit not been recognized  our effective tax rate would have been approximately for fiscal in addition  as a result of the operating losses in fiscal  we were not entitled to the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction which caused a reduction in the effective rate of approximately three percentage points in fiscal our effective tax rate can vary significantly due to the mix of pre tax income in different countries and the estimate of the annual effective rate in each country 
in comparing the fiscal periods to the same periods in fiscal  changes in the effective rate  other than due to the reinstatement of the tax credit and domestic production activities described above  are the result of this mix and the impact that permanent adjustments to taxable income have as a percent of taxable income 
higher levels of pretax income which occurred in fiscal reduce the impact of the differences that cause the statutory rate to deviate from the overall effective tax rate 
the change in the effective tax rate is impacted by the magnitude of various items as a percentage of pretax income or loss 
items such as stock compensation  for example  impacted the effective rate by almost in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these adjustments to pre tax income were comparable in both years in the dollar amount of the adjustment  except for research and development tax credits  which decreased by approximately million  goodwill impairment  which decreased by million  and the addition of the domestic production activities deduction in fiscal fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income tax expense benefit decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was attributable primarily to the decrease in income before income taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate decreased to approximately in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the impact of various items on a pre tax loss position in fiscal compared to a pre tax income position in fiscal items such as stock compensation  for example  impacted the effective rate by almost in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these adjustments to pre tax income were comparable in both years in the dollar amount of the adjustment  except for research and development tax credits  which decreased by approximately million  goodwill impairment  which increased by million  and the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction 
the decrease in the research and development tax credit in fiscal compared to resulted from the elimination of the credit effective january  fiscal year fourth quarter summary during the fourth quarter of fiscal  net sales increased to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased net sales in the live events  transportation  commercial  and international business units  as explained previously 
gross margin percentage increased to in the fourth quarter of fiscal from in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in gross profit levels was primarily due to the impact of lower manufacturing costs as a percent of net sales in fiscal this was partially offset by higher warranty costs as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal selling and general and administrative costs declined by in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the lower level of selling expenses resulted from lower payroll and benefits  depreciation  and various marketing costs  as previously described  partially offset by higher travel and entertainment expense 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher professional fees offset by decreased payroll  including taxes and benefits  as previously explained 
product development costs decreased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was the result of the change in mix of where engineers were spending time customer contracts as opposed to product development and lower payroll costs 
net interest income increased to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was due to higher average rates earned on excess cash invested in marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at april  compared to million at may  we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was million 
the net income of million plus million in changes in net operating assets and liabilities  adjusted by depreciation and amortization of million  million of stock based compensation  and increase in deferred income taxes offset by the million gain on sale of property and equipment  generated the cash provided by operations 
the most significant drivers of the change in net operating assets were the increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
these changes were offset by decreases in income taxes receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  warranty obligations  customer deposits and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings 
the decrease in inventories and accounts receivables were the result of the higher level of net sales 
days sales outstanding increased to days as of the end of fiscal from days as of the end of fiscal days inventory outstanding remained at approximately days at the end of both fiscal years 
other changes in net operating assets were generally related to the change in overall business during the year 
overall  changes in operating assets and liabilities can be impacted by the timing of cash flows on large orders  as described above  that can cause significant fluctuations in the short term 
as a result of various initiatives underway  including changes in manufacturing  purchasing  collections and payment processes  we expect to continue improving our cash flow relative to sales and costs of goods sold from operating activities 
cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal included million for purchase of marketable securities and million used to purchase property and equipment  which was offset by million of other investing activities  net 
during fiscal  we invested approximately million in manufacturing equipment  approximately million in information systems hardware and software  and approximately million in demonstration equipment 
these investments were made to support sales  in the case of demonstration equipment and primarily for maintaining existing infrastructure rather than for growth needs 
for fiscal  capital expenditures were of net sales 
our goal of keeping capital expenditures to less than of net sales is expected to be achieved in fiscal and future years 
for fiscal  our capital expenditures are expected to be closer to as we expand our manufacturing capabilities in china and enhance our internal systems and operations within and outside of manufacturing 
cash used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  which included million paid to shareholders in the form of dividends  offset by million of borrowings under notes payable  million received for option exercises and million in tax benefits from stock based compensation 
included in receivables as of april  was approximately million of retainage on construction type contracts  all of which is expected to be collected within one year 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
our product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to incur expenditures at a rate higher than our long term targeted level of of net sales in fiscal  to develop new display products and solutions using various technologies to offer higher resolution and more cost effective and energy efficient displays  as well as to complement the services and solutions that are provided with the displays 
we also intend to continue developing software applications related to our display systems to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace 
we have a credit agreement with a us bank that was amended on november  it provides for a million line of credit and includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on november  the interest rate ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on the ratio of interest bearing debt to ebitda 
ebitda is defined as net income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
the effective interest rate was at april  we are assessed a loan fee equal to per annum of any non used portion of the loan 
as of april   there were no advances under the line of credit 
the credit agreement is unsecured 
in addition to provisions that limit dividends to the current year net profits after tax  the credit agreement also requires us to be in compliance with the following financial ratios a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to at the end of any fiscal year 
the ratio is equal to a ebitda less dividends  a capital expenditure reserve of million  and income tax expense  over b all principal and interest payments with respect to debt  excluding debt outstanding on the line of credit  and a ratio of interest bearing debt  excluding any marketing obligations  to ebitda of less than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an additional credit agreement with another us bank that is intended to support our credit needs outside of the us  primarily in china 
the facility provides for a million line of credit and includes facilities to issue up to million for letters of credit and bank guarantees and to secure foreign loans 
this credit facility secured a credit facility that we entered into in china during the fourth quarter of fiscal the us credit agreement is unsecured and is cross collateralized with the million line of credit described above 
it contains the same covenants and limitations on dividends as the credit agreement for that line of credit 
as of april   there was million of advances outstanding under the china facility 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of april  the special dividend paid on october  is excluded from the computation of the fixed charge coverage ratio and is not subject to the limitations on dividends set forth in the credit agreement 
the fixed charge coverage ratio as of april  was to  and the ratio of interest bearing debt to ebitda as of april  was approximately to on june   our board declared an annual dividend payment of per share on our common stock for the fiscal year ended april   which is to be paid on june  although we intend to pay regular annual dividends for the foreseeable future  all subsequent dividends will be reviewed annually and declared by our board of directors at its discretion 
we are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations 
we currently have a bonding line available through a surety company that provides for an aggregate of million in bonded work outstanding 
at april   we had approximately million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
we believe that if our growth extends beyond current expectations or if we make any strategic investments  we may need to increase the amount of our credit facility or seek other means of financing our growth 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lender or other sources 
we believe that our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we enter into various debt  lease  purchase and marketing obligations that require payments in future periods 
debt obligations represent primarily bank loans 
operating lease obligations relate primarily to leased manufacturing space  office space  furniture  and vehicles 
long term marketing obligations relate to amounts due in future periods for payments on net sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exchange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenue thresholds are met  all or a portion of excess cash is owed back to the customer 
unconditional purchase obligations represent future payments for inventory and advertising rights purchase commitments 
guarantees include a transaction in connection with the sale of equipment to a financial institution 
under this transaction  we entered into a contractual arrangement whereby we agreed to repurchase equipment at the end of the lease term at a fixed price of approximately million 
we have recognized a guarantee in the amount of million under the provisions of asc  guarantees as of april   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years cash commitments long term marketing obligations and accrued interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligations conditional purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total other commercial commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantees unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions 
as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related balances have not been reflected in any of the columns other than the total column 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or our financial condition  although it could in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal were approximately of net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  chinese renminbi  british pounds  australian dollars or other currencies 
if we believed that currency risk in any foreign location was significant  we would utilize foreign exchange hedging contracts to manage our exposure to the currency fluctuations 
over the long term  net sales to international markets are expected to increase as a percentage of net sales and  consequently  a greater portion of this business could be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we fund our foreign subsidiaries operating cash needs in the form of loans denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
this effect is also impacted by the sources of raw materials from international sources 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect our financial results in the future 
during fiscal  the united states dollar was generally weaker throughout the year relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate  although the fluctuations have not been significant 
the overall weakness of the united states dollar had a positive impact on our international business unit s revenue and net earnings because the foreign denominations translated into more united states dollars 
this has also translated to net gains on advances made by us to our foreign subsidiaries 
it is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales 
however  if there were to be a additional weakening of the united states dollar as compared to all other currencies  we would gain an additional million 
interest rate risks our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt  marketing obligations and long term accounts receivable 
we maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of april   our outstanding debt was million  substantially all of which was in variable rate obligations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant annual effect on variable rate debt based on the balances of such debt as of april  as of april   our outstanding marketing obligations were substantially all of which was in fixed rate obligations 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect our fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of certain display systems  we have entered into various types of financing with customers 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of april   our outstanding long term receivables were million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
the following table provides maturities and weighted average interest rates on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
fiscal years dollars in thousands thereafter assets long term receivables  including current maturities fixed rate average interest rate liabilities long and short term debt fixed rate average interest rate long term marketing obligations  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate approximately million of our cash balances are denominated in united states dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances maintained in accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of the cash held in foreign accounts is used to collateralize outstanding bank guarantees issued by the foreign subsidiary
