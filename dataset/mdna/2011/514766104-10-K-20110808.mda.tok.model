except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of in addition  on april   the company acquired lifecore which develops and manufactures products utilizing hyaluronan  a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues in both animals and humans 
with the acquisition of lifecore  landec has four core businesses food products technology  food export  hyaluronan based biomaterials and technology licensing 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the food export business is operated through apio s cal ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly asian markets 
the hyaluronan based biomaterials business sells products utilizing hyaluronan in the ophthalmic  orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies hyaluronan to customers pursuing other medical applications  such as aesthetic surgery  medical device coatings  tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals 
the technology licensing business includes our proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology in which certain fields of application have been licensed to monsanto and our intelimer polymer business that licenses and or supplies products to companies such as air products and nitta 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation and nature of impairments of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially low risk national and international companies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be usable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses 
the company takes title to all produce it trades and or packages  and therefore  records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the consolidated statements of income 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangibles the company s intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve years and trademarks trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives collectively  intangible assets  which the company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance i upon the acquisition of lifecore in april  our ha based biomaterials reporting unit  ii upon the acquisition of apio in december  which consists of our food products technology and food export reporting units and iii from the repurchase of all non controlling interests in the common stock of landec ag in december accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition 
all intangible assets  including goodwill  associated with the acquisitions of lifecore and apio were allocated to our ha based biomaterials reporting unit and our food products technology reporting unit  respectively  pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit 
the consideration paid for the food export reporting unit approximated its fair market value at the time of acquisition  and therefore  no intangible assets were recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of this reporting unit 
goodwill associated with the technology licensing reporting unit consists entirely of goodwill resulting from the repurchase of the landec ag non controlling interests 
as of may   the ha based biomaterials reporting unit had million of goodwill and the food products technology reporting unit had million of goodwill 
as described below  the million of goodwill in the technology licensing reporting unit was written off as of may  the company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually  in accordance with accounting guidance 
when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  accounting guidance requires the company to compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  accounting guidance requires the company to first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus application of the second step of the two step approach under accounting guidance is not required 
application of the intangible assets impairment tests requires significant judgment by management  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of intangible assets to reporting units  and the determination of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset and reporting unit based upon projections of future net cash flows  discount rates and market multiples  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the company s impairment review requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from the disposal of the assets 
the company conducts quarterly reviews of idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment indicators 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the impairment is viewed as other than temporary 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the asset s book value and its estimated fair value 
depending on the asset  estimated fair value may be determined either by use of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of assets and would increase or decrease any impairment measurement 
the company tested its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment as of july  and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of the intangible assets were necessary as of that date for its ha based biomaterials and food products technology reporting units 
for the technology licensing reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year it became apparent to the company that acceptable biological test results are probably not achievable in the four months left in the agreement before monsanto has to make its purchase option decision see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the uncertainty related to whether monsanto will exercise its purchase option for the licensed fields of technology  and the fact that landec ag is projected to be unprofitable for several years absent any ongoing relationship with monsanto  were the main factors contributing to the significant decrease in the estimated fair value of the landec ag business and as a result the goodwill of the technology licensing reporting unit was determined to be fully impaired as of may   and therefore  the company wrote off the entire million of goodwill associated with the technology licensing reporting unit 
as of may   there were no impairment indicators identified by the company in its analysis of impairment associated with the acquired indefinite lived intangible assets 
on a quarterly basis  the company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its intangible assets  based on management s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation 
such changes  if significant or material  could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the intangible assets during the current period 
the results of these tests could lead to write downs of the carrying values of the intangible assets in the current period 
the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf approach to develop an estimate of fair value 
the dcf approach recognizes that current value is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
indications of value are developed by discounting projected future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the market approach was not used to value the food products technology  hyaluronan based biomaterials and technology licensing reporting units the reporting units because insufficient market comparables exist to enable the company to develop a reasonable fair value of its intangible assets due to the unique nature of each of the company s reporting units 
the dcf approach requires the company to exercise judgment in determining future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future product sales  which are inherently difficult to predict 
these net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the dcf associated with the food products technology reporting unit is based on management s five year projection of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of apio and the industry categories in which apio operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the estimated fair value of the food products technology reporting units as of july  exceeded its book value by and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was million for the food products technology reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was million 
the difference of million was a result of increased produce sourcing costs due to weather related produce shortages which the company had no way of foreseeing 
the fair value of indefinite and finite lived intangible assets associated with our acquisition of lifecore on april   was determined using a dcf model based on management s five year projections of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of lifecore and the industry categories in which lifecore operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the trade name intangible asset was valued using the relief from royalty valuation method and the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of consideration paid  including the fair value of contingent consideration under the terms of the purchase agreement  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company updated its analysis of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill as of its annual impairment analysis date  concluding that the fair value of the hyaluronan based biomaterials reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  exceeded its book value by  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was million for the hyaluronan based biomaterials reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was million 
the difference of million is due to lifecore exceeding its planned net income by million and the change in working capital being much more favorable than planned 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had a valuation allowance of  against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies  when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
the company adopted accounting guidance using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard to i all stock based awards issued on or after may  and ii any outstanding stock based awards that were issued but not vested as of may  the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
upon the adoption of new accounting guidance  the company changed its method of calculating and recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation arrangements to the straight line  single option method 
compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock unit awards granted prior to may  will continue to be recognized using the straight line  multiple option method 
in addition  the new accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non public company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities 
the accounting guidance established a three tier hierarchy for fair value measurements  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which would require the company to develop its own assumptions 
as of may   the company held certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash equivalents  marketable securities  interest rate swap and liability for contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of lifecore 
the fair value of the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on observable inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets 
therefore  the company has categorized its cash equivalents and marketable securities as level the fair value of the company s interest rate swap is determined based on model inputs that can be observed in a liquid market and key inputs include yield curves and are categorized as level inputs 
as of may   the company recorded to other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets an unrealized loss of  net of taxes of  representing the cumulative change in the interest rate swap since inception 
if the interest rate swap is terminated or the debt borrowed is paid off prior to april   the amount of unrealized loss or gain included in other comprehensive income loss would be reclassified to earnings 
the company has no intentions of terminating the interest rate swap or prepaying the debt in the next twelve months 
the interest rate swap liability is included in other non current liabilities as of may  and may  the fair value of the company s liability for contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a level measurement 
the company determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in windset 
the fair value of the company s investment in windset utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models  including projected cash flows  growth rates and the discount rate  and is therefore considered level  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position 
furthermore  the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants 
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
the company has no other financial assets or liabilities for which fair value measurement has been adopted 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted pronouncements fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and the activity in level fair value measurements 
the amendment recommends a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
further  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
also  the amendment requires clarification in existing disclosures for disaggregation of fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the effective date is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted all the amended provisions of new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year and such adoption did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may  variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued new guidance which amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a vie 
additionally  the new guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the company adopted the new guidance on may  and such adoption did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may  revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued new guidance in relation to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
the company early adopted these standards as of may  there have been no materially modified agreements since the adoption of the standard 
the adoption did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the fiscal year ended may  recently issued pronouncements comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued new guidance that improves the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this standard require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either method  adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income oci to net income  in both net income and oci 
the standard does not change the current option for presenting components of oci gross or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which oci is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the standard does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in april  the fasb issued guidance on applying the milestone method of revenue recognition in arrangements with research and development activities 
these amendments are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  the company adoption of the provisions of this update is not expected to have a material impact on its revenue recognition in the company s fiscal year beginning on may  subsequent events in february  the fasb issued updates to the subsequent events guidance requiring an entity that is an sec filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date  in both issued and revised financial statements  through which the filer had evaluated subsequent events 
the adoption is not expected to have an impact on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption in the company s fiscal year beginning on may  business combinations in december  the fasb issued an update requiring a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period 
the disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period 
if comparative financial statements are presented  the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
these amendments affect any public entity as defined by us gaap that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis  and are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company does not expect the provisions of this update to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption in its fiscal year beginning on may  results of operations fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change apio value added apio packaging food technology apio export total apio ha   n m technology licensing total revenues apio value added apio s value added revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh cut and whole value added processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under apio s eat smart brand and various private labels 
in addition  value added revenues include the revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a produce cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
apio value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  were unchanged compared to the same period last year 
this was primarily due to increased unit sales volumes related to new product introductions which increased unit sales volumes by and from a larger percentage of apio value added revenues being generated from sales to club stores rather than retail grocery chains 
these increases in revenue were virtually completely offset by less promotional activity in apio s value added business which reduced unit sales volumes by and due to apio exiting business that would have resulted in less than acceptable gross profit margins which reduced unit sales volumes by another 
on a net basis  apio s value added unit sales volumes decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year apio packaging apio packaging revenues consist of apio s packaging technology business using its breatheway membrane technology 
the first commercial application included in apio packaging is our banana packaging technology and during fiscal year the addition of a second application for avocados 
the increase in apio packaging revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the sale of breatheway membranes for packaged avocados to chiquita 
apio export apio export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to asia by cal ex 
apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit 
the increase in revenues in apio s export business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in export sales volumes as a result of an increased supply of fruit to export and due to more favorable pricing of fruit in fiscal year compared to fiscal year hyaluronan based biomaterials ha lifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing ha 
lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas ophthalmic  which represented over of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year  orthopedic  which represented nearly of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year and veterinary other 
lifecore was acquired on april  from the acquisition date through may   lifecore has added new customers and has expanded its product offerings to existing customers 
technology licensing technology licensing revenues consist of revenues generated from the licensing agreements with monsanto  air products and nitta 
the increase in technology licensing revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was not significant to consolidated landec revenues 
gross profit in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change apio value added apio packaging food technology apio export total apio ha  n m technology licensing total gross profit general there are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix  customer mix  manufacturing costs  volume  sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory  to name a few 
many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors 
the company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these costs include the following raw materials including produce  casein  seeds and packaging  direct labor  overhead including indirect labor  depreciation  and facility related costs and shipping and shipping related costs 
the following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the decrease in gross profit for apio s value added specialty packaging vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to shortages of produce resulting from cold and wet weather in california during the company s third and fourth fiscal quarters which reduced gross profit by approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by a year over year mix change to greater sales of higher margin tray products from lower margin products and fewer promotions on bag products compared to the same period last year 
apio packaging the increase in gross profit for apio packaging for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was not significant to consolidated landec gross profit 
apio export apio s export business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
gross profit during the fiscal year ended may  was flat compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues was higher than the growth in gross profits because of an unfavorable product mix changes to lower margin products which resulted in a lower gross margin during fiscal year of compared to a gross margin of in fiscal year hyaluronan based biomaterials lifecore operates in the higher margin medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin of approximately 
for fiscal year  lifecore s overall gross margin was due to a favorable sales mix 
lifecore was acquired on april  technology licensing the increase in technology licensing gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior year was not significant to consolidated landec gross profit 
operating expenses in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change research and development apio ha  n m technology licensing total r d selling  general and administrative apio ha  n m technology licensing corporate total s  g a other operating expenses technology licensing corporate  n m total other operating expenses research and development landec s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses involved in product development and commercialization initiatives 
research and development efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breatheway membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas and other shelf life sensitive vegetables and fruit 
in the ha business  the research and development efforts primarily relate to technical development efforts to support customer specific product requests or process improvements  under which technical modifications are made to existing products or processes to meet customer specific needs and such work can also lead to new products or processes 
in the technology licensing business  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food and ha 
the increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the research and development expenses from lifecore and from an increase in scientific staff in our technology licensing business to support the development of new product applications 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same periods last year was primarily due to the selling  general and administrative expenses for lifecore  a  increase in the share based compensation expense as a result of option and rsu grants in may and a  increase in accounting and tax fees associated with the initial audit of lifecore and from several tax projects 
other operating expenses other operating expenses consists of impairment charges and transaction costs associated with the lifecore acquisition 
the million in fiscal year in technology licensing is from the write off of landec ag s goodwill 
the million amount in fiscal year in technology licensing is from the partial write down of the company s investment in aesthetic sciences corporation 
the million amount in fiscal year in corporate is for the transaction costs from the acquisition of lifecore on april  non operating income expense in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change dividend income n m interest income interest expense other income n m income taxes noncontrolling interest dividend income the increase in dividend income was due to dividends accrued from the million preferred stock investment in windset see note which yields a cash dividend of annually 
the  represents dividends for the period february  through may  interest income the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to having less cash to invest because of the cash used to acquire lifecore and purchase our minority investment in windset and from lower yields on investments due to declines in interest rates 
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the interest expense on the credit facility entered into on april  in connection with the acquisition of lifecore 
other income the other income is for the  increase in the fair market value of our windset investment see note to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by a  expense for the amortization of the discount on lifecore s earnout obligation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the decrease in the income tax expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal years is due to a decrease in taxable income partially offset by an increase in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal year up from in fiscal year the effective tax rates for fiscal year differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of percent as a result of several factors  including state taxes  non deductible stock based compensation expense  tax exempt interest and the goodwill impairment charge 
in addition to the above  the company was able to further reduce the effective tax rate for fiscal year as a result of being a recipient of a therapeutic drug credit award and the extension of the federal research and development credit see note to the consolidated financial statement for the material components of the company s effective tax rates 
noncontrolling interest the noncontrolling interest consists of the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp 
the decrease in the noncontrolling interest for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same periods last year was not significant 
fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change apio value added apio packaging food technology apio export total apio ha  n m technology licensing total revenues apio value added apio s value added revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh cut and whole value added processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under apio s eat smart brand and various private labels

if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms  if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months
