item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of part ii of this annual report on form k relating to liquidity and capital resources may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made 
the company disclaims any obligation  except as specifically required by law and the rules of the securities and exchange commission  to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in the company s expectations or in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based  or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed below and within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and related notes thereto 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a weak global economy and softening in the computer software market may result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates the profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the financial services markets and other markets in which it competes 
tighter credit and negative financial news resulting from the recent worldwide recession may continue to have an adverse affect on the market for computer software and result in significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
because the company s sales are primarily to major corporate customers  poor economic conditions may continue to soften the demand for computer software and services which may result in decreased revenues  lower revenue growth rates and reduced profitability 
in addition  a weak global economy may result in longer sales cycles  reduced  deferred or cancelled orders  or greater than anticipated uncollectible accounts receivables 
in a weakened economy  the company cannot be assured that it will be able to effectively promote future growth in its software and services revenues or maintain profitability 
the company s dependence on its principal products and its failure to develop enhanced or new products may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations in the year ended september   the monarch report analytics platform accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company is primarily dependent on its monarch report analytics platform products 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of any of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of new and enhanced versions of these products and development of new versions of these and other products and subsequent customer acceptance of such new and enhanced products 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in significant price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations the company s future operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter because of uncertainties and or risks associated with such matters as current economic conditions  technological change  competition  delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements and general market trends 
in addition  as the company focuses on increasing enterprise sales  the timing of significant orders may cause fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  the company has operated with minimal backlog of orders because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
as a result  net sales in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
further  any increases in sales under the company s subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term 
because the company s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s costs are fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company can give no assurance that it will not experience such variations in operating results in the future or that such variations will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on new product introductions and new product delays or defects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business growth in the company s business depends in substantial part on the continuing introduction of new products 
the length of product life cycles depends in part on end user demand for new or additional functionality in the company s products and its ability to update its products to meet such demands 
if the company fails to accurately anticipate the demand for  or encounters any significant delays in developing or introducing  new products or additional functionality in its products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business 
product life cycles can also be affected by suppliers of operating systems introducing new or changed functionality within their products 
the failure of the company to anticipate the introduction of additional functionality in products developed by such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s competitors may introduce products with more features and lower prices than the company s products 
such increase in competition could adversely affect the life cycles of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
software products  whether developed internally or licensed from third parties  may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential end users  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the market price of the company s stock has been and may continue to be volatile as seen recently with the turmoil in the financial markets  and is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating companies acquired by the company  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
finally  to maintain its stock listing with nasdaq  the company must be in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rules  including but not limited to  minimum bid price requirements 
if it is not able to maintain compliance with these rules  and if the company s common stock does not qualify for  or is subsequently delisted from  the nasdaq capital market  investors may have difficulty converting their investment into cash efficiently 
the price of the company s common stock and the ability of holders to sell such stock would be adversely affected 
a significant percentage of the company s total revenue is subject to risks associated with international sales in the years ended september  and  international sales accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its total revenue 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue will therefore be subject to risks associated with international sales  including further deterioration of international economic conditions  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  currency exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  possible effects of war and acts of terrorism  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse foreign tax consequences 
past and future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt the company s business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention historically  the company has acquired certain technology or businesses to supplement and expand its product offerings 
in the future  the company could acquire additional products  technologies or businesses  or enter into joint venture arrangements  for the purpose of complementing or expanding its business and to address the need to develop new products 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving and maintaining the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies business is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
there may be limitations on the effectiveness of the company s controls the company s management  including the chief executive officer and president and the chief financial officer  does not expect that its internal controls will prevent all errors and intentional misrepresentations 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and no assurance can be given that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or intentional conduct may occur and not be detected 
the company may be adversely impacted by rapid technological change the markets in which the company competes have undergone  and can be expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
the ability of the company to grow will depend on its ability to successfully update and improve its existing products and market and license new products to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and that can compete successfully with the existing and new products of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully anticipate and satisfy the changing demands of the personal computer software marketplace  that the company will be able to continue to enhance its product offerings  or that technological changes in hardware platforms or software operating systems  or the introduction of a new product by a competitor  will not render the company s products obsolete 
the company faces significant competition in the software industry the software market is highly competitive and characterized by continual change and improvement in technology 
several of the company s existing and potential competitors  including asg software solutions  ca technologies  bmc software and others  have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will have the resources required to compete successfully in the future 
the company s success is dependent on proprietary software technology the company s success is dependent upon proprietary software technology 
the company does not own patents on any such technology and relies principally on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its rights to such proprietary technology 
despite such precautions  there can be no assurance that such steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of such technology 
the company relies on software licensed from third parties a majority of the company s products incorporate third party proprietary technology which is generally licensed to the company on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
failure by such third parties to continue to develop technology for the company and license such technology to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company may not be able to hire and retain highly skilled employees  which could affect its ability to compete effectively because its business is technology based qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
the company s success depends  in large part  upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly technical personnel and product development and professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
the company s failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to the company s product development  professional services and direct sales teams may limit the rate at which the company can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
a change in key management could result in transition and attrition in the affected department 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec regulations as well as the listing standards of the nasdaq stock market  have created and are continuing to create uncertainty for public companies 
the company continually evaluates and monitors developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs incurred or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
the company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  the company has invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards 
this investment has and may continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if the company s efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against the company and it may be harmed 
the failure of indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results the company sells a significant portion of its products through distributors and resellers  none of which are under the direct control of the company 
the loss of major distributors or resellers of the company s products  or a significant decline in their sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has taken steps to terminate its arrangement with ingram micro  inc effective in march ingram accounted for  and of the company total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain qualified distributors or resellers or that any such distributors or resellers will be able to effectively sell the company s products  including the volume of products previously sold by ingram micro  inc the company seeks to select and retain distributors and resellers on the basis of their business credentials and their ability to add value through expertise in specific vertical markets or application programming expertise 
in addition  the company may rely on resellers to provide post sales service and support  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business 
failure to maintain an adequate sales returns reserve could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations revenue from the company s sale of all software products when separately sold is generally recognized at the time of shipment 
the company estimates and maintains reserves for potential future product returns from distributors based on its experience and history with the company s various distributors and resellers as well as by monitoring inventory levels at such companies 
while actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by management  future actual results could differ from the reserve for sales returns recorded  and this difference could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s subscription sales model for its enterprise products could result in decreased or delayed revenues and cash flows the company sells its enterprise products through the sale of perpetual licenses and through a subscription pricing model 
the subscription pricing model allows customers to use the company s products at a lower initial cost of software acquisition when compared to the more traditional perpetual license sale 
although the subscription sales model is designed to increase the number of enterprise solutions sold and also reduce dependency on short term sales by building a recurring revenue stream  it introduces increased risks for the company primarily associated with the timing of revenue recognition and reduced cash flows 
the subscription model delays revenue recognition when compared to the typical perpetual license sale and also  as the company allows termination of certain subscriptions with days notice  could result in decreased revenue for solutions sold under the model if the company experiences a high percentage of subscription cancellations following the first months of the subscription 
further  as amounts due from customers are invoiced over the life of the subscription  there are delayed cash flows from subscription sales when compared to perpetual license sales 
catastrophic events may adversely affect our business the company is a highly automated business and relies on its network infrastructure and enterprise applications  internal technology systems and website for development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major storm  earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  reputational harm  delays in the company s product development and loss of critical data and could affect its ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of its business

critical accounting policies in the preparation of financial statements and other financial data  management applies certain accounting policies to transactions that  depending on judgments made by management  can result in different outcomes 
in order for a reader to understand the following information regarding the financial performance and condition of the company  an understanding of those accounting policies is important 
certain of those policies are comparatively more important to the company s financial results and condition than others 
the policies that the company believes are most important for a reader s understanding of the financial information provided in this report are described below 
revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts and returns reserve the company sells its solutions directly to end users  through value added resellers and through distributors 
sales to distributors and resellers accounted for approximately and  of total sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
revenue from the sale of all software products when separately sold is generally recognized at the time of shipment  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and there are no significant obligations remaining 
both types of the company s software product offerings are off the shelf as such term is customarily defined 
the company s software products can be installed and used by customers on their own with little or no configuration required 
multi user licenses marketed by the company are sold as a right to use the number of licenses  and license fee revenue is recognized upon delivery of all software required to satisfy the number of licenses sold 
upon delivery  the licensing fee is payable without further delivery obligations to the company 
datawatch software products are generally sold in multiple element arrangements which may include software licenses  professional services and post contract customer support 
in such multiple element arrangements  the company applies the residual method in determining revenue to be allocated to the software license 
in applying the residual method  the company deducts from the sale proceeds the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the professional services and post contract customer support in determining the residual fair value of the software license 
the vsoe of fair value of the services and post contract customer support is based on the amounts charged for these elements when sold separately 
professional services include implementation  integration  training and consulting services with revenue recognized as the services are performed 
these services are generally delivered on a time and materials basis  are billed on a current basis as the work is performed  and do not involve modification or customization of the software or any other unusual acceptance clauses or terms 
post contract customer support is typically provided under a maintenance agreement which provides technical support and rights to unspecified software maintenance updates and bug fixes on a when and if available basis 
revenue from post contract customer support services is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of support generally one year 
such deferred amounts are recorded as part of deferred revenue in the company s consolidated balance sheets included herein 
the company also licenses its enterprise software using a subscription model 
at the time a customer enters into a binding agreement to purchase a subscription  the customer is invoiced for an initial day service period and an account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded 
beginning on the date the software is installed at the customer site and available for use by the customer  and provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition are met  the deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided 
the customer is then invoiced every days and revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the subscription 
the subscription arrangement includes software  maintenance and unspecified future upgrades including major version upgrades 
the subscription renewal rate is the same as the initial subscription rate 
subscriptions can be cancelled by the customer at any time by providing days written notice following the first year of the subscription term 
the company s software products are sold under warranty against certain defects in material and workmanship for a period of days from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a day money back guarantee on its monarch product sold directly to end users 
additionally  the company provides its distributors with stock balancing rights 
revenue from the sale of software products to distributors and resellers is recognized at the time of shipment providing all other criteria for revenue recognition as stated above are met and i the distributor or reseller is unconditionally obligated to pay for the products  including no contingency as to product resale  ii the distributor or reseller has independent economic substance apart from the company  iii the company is not obligated for future performance to bring about product resale  and iv the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
the company s experience and history with its distributors and resellers allows for reasonable estimates of future returns 
among other things  estimates of potential future returns are made based on the inventory levels at  and the returns history with  the various distributors and resellers  which the company monitors frequently 
once the estimates of potential future returns from all sources are made  the company determines if it has adequate returns reserves to cover anticipated returns and the returns reserve is adjusted as required 
adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases in revenue in the period of adjustment 
actual returns have historically been within the range estimated by the company 
the company s returns reserves were  and  as of september  and  respectively 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company records an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
income taxes the company has deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that expire at different times through and until at september   the company had us federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through  including  resulting from the mergence acquisition undertaken during which are subject to additional annual limitations as a result of the changes in mergence s ownership  and had approximately million in state tax loss carryforwards  which also expire at various dates through an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  is available to offset future regular federal taxes 
research and development credits of approximately  expire beginning in in addition  the company has the following foreign net operating loss carryforwards united kingdom losses of million with no expiration date  australia losses of million with no expiration date and germany losses of  with no expiration date 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
factors such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  changes in enacted tax rates and the period over which the company s deferred tax assets will be recoverable are considered in making these determinations 
management does not believe the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets at september  and management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and  if current economic conditions change or future results of operations are better than expected  future assessments may result in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
if this conclusion were reached  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets would be reduced resulting in a tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes 
total net deferred tax assets subject to the full valuation allowance were approximately million as of september  the company follows the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the comprehensive model addresses the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
in accordance with these requirements  the company first determines whether a tax authority would more likely than not sustain its tax position if it were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information 
for those tax positions that meet this threshold  the company measures the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that the company has a greater than chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
the company maintains a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of its uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis  but the evaluation of the company s tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because  in certain cases  tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
the actual outcome of the company s tax positions  if significantly different from its estimates  could materially impact the financial statements 
at october   the company had a cumulative tax liability of  related to foreign tax exposure 
during each of the fiscal years ended september  and  the company increased its tax liability by  resulting in a cumulative tax liability of  at september  these amounts have been recorded as an increase to other long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain software development costs as well as purchased software upon achieving technological feasibility of the related products 
software development costs incurred and software purchased prior to achieving technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
commencing upon initial product release  capitalized costs are amortized to cost of software licenses using the straight line method over the estimated life of the product which approximates the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  which is generally to months 
the net amount of capitalized software development costs and purchased software was approximately  and  at september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company did not capitalize any software development costs related to new products in development 
valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets intangible assets consist of internally developed software  patents and customer lists acquired through business combinations 
the values allocated to these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever an indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of the company s long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
no impairment charges were taken for intangible assets during fiscal year accounting for share based compensation the company recognizes share based compensation expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require that all share based awards  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value at date of grant 
the company recognizes the fair value of share based awards over the requisite service period of the individual awards  which generally equals the vesting period 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded share based compensation expense of approximately  in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
the company believes this approach results in a reasonable estimate of volatility 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   the company used an expected stock price volatility of based upon the historical volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the expected option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees including the reaction to vesting  realizable value and short time to maturity effect 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended september   the company used an expected option life assumption of years 
with regard to the forfeiture rate assumption  the company reviews historical voluntary turnover rates 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended september   the company used an annual estimated forfeiture rate of 
additional expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated  and a recovery of prior expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
the company also periodically grants awards of restricted stock units rsu to each of its non employee directors and some of its employees on a discretionary basis pursuant to its stock compensation plans 
each rsu entitles the holder to receive  at the end of each vesting period  a specified number of shares of the company s common stock
