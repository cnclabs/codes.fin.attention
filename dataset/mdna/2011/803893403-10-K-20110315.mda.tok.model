overview satcon technology corporation satcon or company is a leading clean energy technology provider of utility grade power conversion solutions for the renewable energy market 
we design and deliver advanced power conversion solutions that enable large scale producers of renewable energy to convert clean energy into grid connected  efficient and reliable electrical power 
our power conversion solutions boost total system power production through systems intelligence  advanced command and control capabilities  industrial grade engineering and total lifecycle performance optimization 
our power conversion solutions feature the widest range of power ratings in the industry 
we also offer system design services and solutions for management  monitoring  and performance measurement to maximize capital investment and improve overall quality and performance over the entire lifespan of an installation critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable reserves  inventory reserves  intangible assets  contract losses  warranty reserves and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our audit committee 

table of contents the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are typically shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments 
if the product requires installation to be performed by us  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
if the product requires specific customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse  unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
when appropriate  we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided 
the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is recognized on each element as described above 
on occasion we enter into fixed price contracts for which  revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
for the years ended december  and there have been no provisions for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts 
we expect revenue from the percentage of completion type contracts or from cost reimbursement contracts in future periods to be nominal 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed  product shipped or installation completed 
when an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes  the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties 
unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  and costs are determined based on the first in  first out method of accounting and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory within cost of product revenue based primarily on our historical usage  as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty we offer warranty coverage for our products for period of years after shipment 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are re evaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
warrant liabilities we determined the fair values of the investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the warrants 
an increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of warrants to increase  because the exercise prices of such instruments are fixed at per share  and result in a charge to our statement of operations 
a decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate 
table of contents and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
in addition  we are required to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the tax years through remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject  which are primarily in the united states  as carry forward attributes generated in years past may still be adjusted upon examination by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities if they are or will be used in a future period 
we are currently not under examination by the internal revenue service or any other jurisdiction for any tax years 
we did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements 
we would record any such interest and penalties as a component of interest expense 
we do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized benefits within months of the reporting date 
redeemable convertible series b preferred stock we initially accounted for our series b preferred stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible series b preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors  and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities 
we determined the initial value of the series b preferred stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
prior to its conversion in october  the series b preferred stock had been classified within the liability section of our balance sheet 
redeemable convertible series c preferred stock prior to the conversion of all the outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock in october  we initially accounted for the issuance of our series c preferred stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible series c preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors  and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities and classifying the series c preferred stock as temporary equity on the balance sheet between the captions for liabilities and permanent shareholder equity 
we determined the initial value of the series c preferred stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
the re pricing of the exercise price of the warrants issued in the first closing of the series c preferred stock financing from to  as described in note i to our notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on november  and a re issuance or new warrants on december  the difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the series c preferred stock on december  we treated this as a deemed dividend on the series c preferred stock 
as of december  we recorded  as a deemed dividend to the holders of the series c preferred stock  which included the beneficial conversion feature of  and  related to the accretion of the series c preferred stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the series c preferred stock may first exercise their redemption right 
prior to the conversion of the series c preferred stock in october  we were using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the 
table of contents series c preferred stock through november   at which time the value of the series c preferred stock would have been million  of its face value

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  all of which was unrestricted 
as of december   million was outstanding under our line of credit 
based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we believe that our current cash  and our asset based financing options  will be adequate to fund our operations through december  beyond  we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow  which we expect to improve as our product costs continue to decrease and as our unit volumes continue to grow 
we also expect to use our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments 
subsequent to year end we repaid all amounts outstanding on the line of credit 
we have availability under our line of credit of million as of march  our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses  or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line and subordinated debt 
if either of those events occur  we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position  which could include selling of certain assets  delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions in the credit facility with silicon valley bank 
such actions would likely require the consent of silicon valley bank and or the lender of our subordinated debt  and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required 
if additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution 
the terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially  adversely affect our results of operations 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products 
these costs have exceeded total revenue 
as a result  we have incurred losses in each of the past five years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
since inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt  public security offerings  borrowings under our lines of credit and capital equipment leases 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  this represents an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately million from the million on hand at december  cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss from continuing operations of approximately million offset by non cash items such as the change in the fair value of our warrants  depreciation and amortization  deferred revenue  increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory  non cash compensation and consulting expense  non cash interest expense and decreases in working capital 
cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended december  was million as compared to cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended december  and was a result of capital expenditures

in addition  in june we entered into a million subordinated debt agreement 
the future minimum principal and interest payments under the subordinated debt agreement and the future minimum rental payments as of december  are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities 
in addition  our ability to fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
to manage interest rage exposure our strategy is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments 
our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of twelve months 
currently  our short term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of days or less 
at december   our short term investments approximated market value 
at december  we had a revolving line of credit available to us of up to million  of which million was outstanding 
our revolving line of credit bears an interest rate of the bank prime rate plus per annum  which resulted in a rate of at december  the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of december  over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows interest expense increase interest rates increase by basis points interest rates increase by basis points foreign currency risk we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we  or any of our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than ours  or its  functional currency 
intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk 
during the year ended december   the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of million 
we have not historically used derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge such economic exposures 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by sales to foreign customers  which in many instances are denominated in the customers local currency  our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly that of the european union and to a lesser extent the canadian dollar  upon the translation of the earnings into the us dollar 
if the us dollar had been uniformly stronger by  or  compared to the actual average exchange rates used to translate the financial results of our foreign sales  our net product sales revenue would not have been materially impacted  as depicted by the table below approximate decrease in net revenue in millions if  during the year ended december   the us dollar was stronger by during the reporting currency of our canadian division was determined to be the us dollar
