overview we enable individuals to take charge of improving their health and quality of life at home  under medical supervision  by developing new capabilities in near patient diagnosis  monitoring and health management 
our global  leading products and services  as well as our new product development efforts  currently focus on cardiology  women s health  infectious disease  oncology and toxicology 
we are continuing to expand our product and service offerings in all of these categories 
as a global  leading supplier of near patient monitoring tools  as well as value added healthcare services  we are uniquely positioned to improve care and lower healthcare costs for both providers and patients 
our rapidly growing home coagulation monitoring business  which supports doctors and patients efforts to monitor warfarin therapy using our inratio blood coagulation monitoring system  continues to represent an early example of this 
we have also continued to introduce our new integrated health management technology platform  called apollo  to our customers since its launch on january  using a sophisticated data engine for acquiring and analyzing information  combined with a state of the art touch engine for communicating with individuals and their health partners  we expect apollo to benefit healthcare providers  health insurers and patients alike by enabling more efficient and effective health management programs 
we have continued to grow through strategic acquisitions 
our february acquisition of kroll laboratory specialists  inc  now renamed alere toxicology  as well as other small acquisitions during the year  expanded the range of toxicology testing products and services that we can offer government agencies  employers  health plans and healthcare professionals 
our acquisition of standard diagnostics brought us a comprehensive range of rapid diagnostic products  with particular strength in the infectious disease category 
this acquisition builds on our already significant presence in asia pacific through its distribution capabilities in south korea and india  and additionally provides us with a strong management team and established manufacturing facilities in each of those countries 
we also acquired a small health management provider in australia and expect to continue to expand our health management business outside the us through selective acquisitions 

table of contents during  we completed several technology based acquisitions that we hope will aid us in bringing future products or diagnostic platforms to market 
through the acquisition of two privately owned research and development operations  we have enhanced our capabilities in the area of rapid molecular diagnostic testing 
additionally  in november  we acquired adnagen  a small german company specializing in the development of cancer diagnostics through the detection and analysis of circulating tumor cells in order to determine the correct course of therapy for individual cancer patients 
we hope that this acquisition will assist us in developing a rapid molecular testing platform focused on oncology  allowing for truly personalized cancer care 
we continued to lay the groundwork during for future revenue and earnings growth by focusing our efforts on new product development and introductions 
we introduced our alere heart check system in europe and  while the european launch is in very early stages  early indicators are positive 
the alere heart check system provides a quantitative reading of bnp in minutes using a fingerstick sample with substantially equivalent performance to lab instruments 
the alere heart check system  while launched as a point of care device  is ultimately designed for home use and is intended to enable doctors to remotely monitor bnp levels of congestive heart failure patients and adjust their therapy accordingly 
additionally  during  we introduced our alere cd analyzer in additional countries in africa and asia pacific 
the alere cd analyzer is the first point of care platform which measures absolute cd counts in hiv patients with results in minutes  through single use  disposable fingerstick cartridges 
we also made headway during in sales of the epoc platform  and expect this trend to continue as we make progress in securing contracts through the relatively long sales process associated with integrated networks and large hospital systems 
the epoc enterprise point of care platform is a point of care analysis system which provides wireless bedside blood gas and electrolyte measurement testing solutions and complements our triage products in cardiology and emergency room settings 
utilizing easy to use  low cost disposable smart cards tm  the epoc system produces laboratory quality results in critical and acute care settings in about seconds 
we continue to build momentum for two novel biomarkers  ngal and placental growth factor plgf 
in  we introduced the triage ngal test outside the us  as the world s first point of care test for acute kidney injury aki and we expect us fda clearance for this product in in january  we launched triage plgf in europe 
plgf is a novel biomarker that aids in the early diagnosis of pre eclampsia pe  which is the leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality 
our efforts have focused on building awareness and acceptance of this marker outside of the us  while key clinical studies needed to gain regulatory clearance in the us and japan are expected to commence in financial highlights net revenue increased by million  or  to billion in  from billion in gross profit increased by million  or  to billion in  from billion in for the year ended december   we generated a net loss of billion  or per basic and diluted common share after preferred stock dividends  based on a net loss available to common stockholders of billion

the terms and conditions of our outstanding debt instruments also contain covenants which expressly restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and conduct other financings 
as of december   we had billion in outstanding indebtedness comprised of million of subordinated notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million under our first lien credit agreement  million under our second lien credit agreement and million of senior subordinated convertible notes 
the terms and conditions of our outstanding debt are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if the capital and credit markets experience volatility or the availability of funds is limited  we may incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and or other debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and or react to changing economic and business conditions 
our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted by unexpected costs associated with integrating the operations of newly acquired companies  executing our cost savings strategies and prosecuting and defending our existing lawsuits and or unforeseen lawsuits against us 
we also cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be realized 
in addition  we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts related to the substantial intellectual property portfolio we own 
we may also choose to further expand our research 
table of contents and development efforts and may pursue the acquisition of new products and technologies through licensing arrangements  business acquisitions  or otherwise 
we may also choose to make significant investment to pursue legal remedies against potential infringers of our intellectual property 
if we decide to engage in such activities  or if our operating results fail to meet our expectations  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may be available only on terms which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible securities  dilution to then existing stockholders may result 
after december   we repurchased in negotiated transactions  shares of our series b preferred stock which were convertible into approximately  shares of our common stock  at a cost of million  which we paid in cash 
following these repurchases  we have approximately million remaining from the initial million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in december in connection with the formation of spd in may  we entered into an option agreement with p g  pursuant to which p g has the right  for a period of days commencing on may   to require us to acquire all of p g s interest in spd at fair market value  and p g has the right  upon certain material breaches by us of our obligations to spd  to acquire all of our interest in spd at fair market value

as of december   we had an aggregate of million in outstanding capital lease obligations which are payable through income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of domestic nol and capital loss carryforwards and million of foreign nol and capital loss carryforwards  respectively  which either expire on various dates through or may be carried forward indefinitely 
these losses are available to reduce federal  state and foreign taxable income  if any  in future years 
these losses are also subject to review and possible adjustments by the applicable taxing authorities 
in addition  the domestic nol carryforward amount at december  included approximately million of pre acquisition losses at matria  qas  paradigmhealth  biosite  cholestech  redwood  hemosense  ischemia  inc and ostex international  inc effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations 
prior to adoption of this standard  the pre acquisition losses were applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non current intangible assets related to the acquisitions  prior to reducing our income tax expense 
upon adoption of the new accounting standard  the reduction of a valuation allowance is generally recorded to reduce our income tax expense 
furthermore  all domestic losses are subject to the internal revenue service code section limitation and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 
section imposes an annual limitation on the use of these losses to an amount equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to our nols and certain of our other deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainties that might affect the realization of such deferred tax assets  as these assets can only be realized via profitable operations

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by our management and our audit committee to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application depends on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
in addition  the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  include a comprehensive summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we primarily recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is derived from product sales 
we recognize revenue upon title transfer of the products to third party customers  less a reserve for estimated product returns and allowances 
determination of the reserve for estimated product returns and allowances is based on our management s analyses and judgments regarding certain conditions 
should future changes in conditions prove management s conclusions and judgments on previous analyses to be incorrect  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
additionally  we generate services revenue in connection with contracts with health plans both commercial and governmental and self insured employers  whereby we provide clinical expertise through fee based arrangements 
revenue for fee based arrangements is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk if our customers do not achieve certain financial cost savings or we do not achieve certain other clinical and operational metrics  over a period of time  typically one year 
revenue subject to refund is not recognized if i sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements or ii interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets 
if either of these two conditions exists  we record the amounts as other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  deferring recognition of the revenue until we establish that we are meeting the performance criteria 
if we do not meet the performance targets at the end of the contractual period we are obligated under the contract to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
our deferred revenue balance was million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
we also receive license and royalty revenue from agreements with third party licensees 
revenue from fixed fee license and royalty agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the obligation period of the related license agreements 
license and royalty fees that the licensees calculate based on their sales  which we have the right to audit under most of our agreements  are generally recognized upon receipt of the license or royalty payments  unless we are able to reasonably estimate the fees as they are earned 
license and royalty fees that are determinable prior to the receipt thereof are recognized in the period they are earned 
use of estimates for sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts certain sales arrangements require us to accept product returns 
from time to time  we also enter into sales incentive arrangements with our retail customers  which generally reduce the sale prices of our products 
as a result  we must establish allowances for potential future product returns and claims resulting from our sales incentive arrangements against product revenue recognized in any reporting period 
calculation of these 
table of contents allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances  our management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer and consumer demand and acceptance of our products 
when such analysis is not available and a right of return exists  we record revenue when the right of return is no longer applicable 
material differences in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any reporting period may result if changes in conditions arise that would require management to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
our total provision for sales returns and other allowances related to sales incentive arrangements amounted to million  million and million  or  and  respectively  of net product sales in  and  respectively  which have been recorded against product sales to derive our net product sales 
of these amounts  approximately million  million and million  for  and  respectively  represent allowances for future deductions which have been provided against our related accruals for such charges with the balance charged directly against net sales 
similarly  our management must make estimates regarding uncollectible accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms and patterns 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated current market value of the inventory  less cost to sell 
in addition  we periodically review the inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
this provision reduces the carrying value of our inventory and is calculated based primarily upon factors such as forecasts of our customers demands  shelf lives of our products in inventory  loss of customers and manufacturing lead times 
evaluating these factors  particularly forecasting our customers demands  requires management to make assumptions and estimates 
actual product and services revenue may prove our forecasts to be inaccurate  in which case we may have underestimated or overestimated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize the excess value as a charge to our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we would have over reported our cost of sales  or understated our earnings  at the time we recorded the excess and obsolete provision 
our inventory balance was million and million  net of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets are initially created as a result of business combinations or acquisitions of intellectual property 
the values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values calculated by accepted valuation methods 
such valuations require us to provide significant estimates and assumptions which are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
critical estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will 
table of contents continue to use the acquired brand and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets  as discussed below  may indicate impairment  which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
where we believe that property  plant and equipment and intangible assets have finite lives  we depreciate and amortize those assets over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  our management has historically examined the carrying value of our identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill  including their useful lives where we believe such assets have finite lives  when indicators of impairment are present 
in addition  we conduct an impairment review on the carrying values of all goodwill on at least an annual basis 
for all long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill  if an impairment loss is identified based on the fair value of the asset  as compared to the carrying value of the asset  such loss would be charged to expense in the period we identify the impairment 
furthermore  if our review of the carrying values of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives indicates impairment of such assets  we may determine that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate 
in that event  we will be required to record higher depreciation and amortization in future periods  which will reduce our earnings 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with asc  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests  if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for step  we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  or dcf  and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
assumptions used in the dcf require the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values  growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the forecasted cash flows are based on our most recent budget and for years beyond the budget  our estimates are based on assumed growth rates 
we believe our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the discount rates  which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections  used in the dcf are based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit 
the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we are required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date  allocating the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities 
the residual amount from performing this allocation represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded 
we conducted our annual impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of key assumptions which vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the discounted cash flow approach included discount rates ranging from to  projected compound average revenue growth rates of to and terminal value growth rates of 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  
table of contents we considered the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit  which among other factors considers the cost of common equity capital and the marginal cost of debt of market participants 
key assumptions which again vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the market approach were based on observed market multiples of enterprise value to revenue and ebitda for both comparable publicly traded companies and recent merger and acquisition transactions involving similar companies to estimate appropriate controlling basis multiples to apply to each of the reporting units 
based on the multiples implied by this market data  we selected multiples of revenue of to times and multiples of ebitda of to times 
in assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair values of the reporting units  management compared the results of the valuation analyses against our then current market capitalization to imply a control premium 
based on this analysis  the implied control premium was within the range of comparable industry transactions 
the step impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of our health management reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for the health management reporting unit 
we completed step  consistent with the procedures described above  and determined that a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of approximately billion was required 
the resulting goodwill impairment charge is reflected in operating income loss in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our business units 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible asset testing as of the time of testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding business plans  competitive environments or anticipated growth rates are not correct  we may be required to record goodwill and or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or earlier  if an indicator of an impairment is present before our next annual evaluation 
impairment charges related to goodwill have no impact on our cash balances or compliance with financial covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement 
valuation of other long lived tangible and intangible assets factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value and goodwill impairment identified during an impairment review 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the impairment test indicated there was an impairment of goodwill associated with our health management reporting unit  and thus  a potential impairment of our long lived tangible and intangible assets associated with the same reporting unit 
we conducted an analysis as prescribed under asc property  plant and equipment  utilizing an undiscounted cash flow model 
the analysis indicated there was no impairment of the long lived tangible or intangible assets associated with our health management reporting unit 
although we believe that the carrying value of our long lived tangible and intangible assets was realizable as of december   future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant 
table of contents date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected term is based on the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting date and the full contractual term  including data on experience to date 
as stock based compensation expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals and lives assigned to long lived and intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within our tax provision 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the future benefits  if any  from our deferred tax assets related primarily to our foreign businesses and certain us net operating losses  or nols  and tax credits 
included in this valuation allowance is million for deferred tax assets of acquired companies  the future benefits of which will be generally applied to reduce our income tax expense 
this is an increase of million from the valuation allowance of million as of december  the increase is primarily related to domestic state nols and domestic state credits 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we established reserves for tax uncertainties that reflect the use of the comprehensive model for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
we are currently undergoing routine tax examinations by us federal  various state and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
loss contingencies in the section of this annual report on form k titled part i  item  legal proceedings  we have reported on material legal proceedings  if any 
because of the nature of our business  we may be subject at any particular time to lawsuits or other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  and we expect that this will continue to be the case in the future 
we do not accrue for potential losses on legal proceedings where our company is the defendant when we are not able to reasonably estimate our potential liability  if any  due to uncertainty as to the nature  extent and validity of the claims against us  uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the damages or other relief sought by the plaintiff and the complexity of the issues involved 
our potential liability  if any  in a particular case 
table of contents may become reasonably estimable and probable as the case progresses  in which case we will begin accruing for the expected loss

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities
