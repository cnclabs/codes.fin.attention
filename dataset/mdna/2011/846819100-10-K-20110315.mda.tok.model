utilimaster  which we acquired on november   is a leading manufacturer of specialty vehicles made to customer specifications in the service and delivery market  including walk in vans and hi cube vans  as well as truck bodies 
our business strategy is to further diversify product lines and develop innovative design  engineering and manufacturing expertise in order to be the best value producer of custom vehicle products 
spartan chassis sells its custom chassis to three principal markets fire truck  motor home and other product sales which include defense and other specialty vehicles and aftermarket parts and assemblies apa 
our diversification across several sectors gives numerous opportunities while minimizing overall risk 
additionally  our business model provides the agility to quickly respond to market needs  take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size operations to ensure stability and growth 
we have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with its customers 
this is accomplished by striving to deliver premium custom vehicles  vehicle components  and services that inspire customer loyalty 
we believe that we can best carry out our long term business plan and obtain optimal financial flexibility by using a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities  as well as equity capital  as sources of expansion capital 
recent acquisition and divestiture consistent with our strategy to further diversify our business operations  we acquired utilimaster on november   as more fully described in note  acquisition activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
utilimaster is a leading manufacturer of specialty vehicles made to customer specifications in the service and delivery market  including walk in vans and hi cube vans  as well as truck bodies 
we expect the acquisition of utilimaster will further diversify our revenue stream into new markets that offer growth potential and are not directly dependent on government funding or consumer spending 
we believe the acquisition also allows us to gain entry into the north american service and delivery market  add fabrication and vehicle body expertise  benefit from utilimaster s strong brand  market share position  and solid customer base  and create opportunities to leverage future growth in our chassis business 
on september   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
we believe that our company s performance will be enhanced by redeploying our resources from road rescue to support our other businesses 
net loss for road rescue  reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the net loss for road rescue for includes a pre tax gain on the sale of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of road rescue of million 
executive overview revenues from continuing operations increased by to million  due mainly to our acquisition of utilimaster  which was acquired on november  excluding utilimaster  sales decreased or million from  mainly due to weakness in the market for fire apparatus  along with lower levels of aftermarket parts sales  especially as related to our mine resistant ambush protected vehicles mrap and other defense products 
in spite of the challenging economic conditions  we recorded net income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share due in large part to focused cost containment efforts 
cash flow remained strong and enabled us to reduce debt by million during while many of our markets were flat to down in compared to  the market for motor home chassis rebounded sharply  although it remains well below its peak 
we continued to invest in product innovation and long term strategic growth objectives with one time research and development charges of million in  which included our investment in two significant initiatives the reach next generation commercial van ngcv  which is being developed in alliance with isuzu  and new cab and chassis designs to support the emissions standards 
our company remains financially solid with a strong cash balance  low debt and an open line of credit 
we are well positioned to take advantage of long term opportunities as a result of our diversified business model 
we believe the major strength of our business model is market diversity and customization  with a foundation in emergency response as well as service and delivery vehicles 
the service and delivery vehicle market is an early cycle industry  complementary to the late cycle emergency response industry 
we intend to continue to pursue additional areas that build on our core competencies in order to further diversify our business 
our improved ability to react swiftly when challenges arise  as demonstrated by our recent aggressive cost realignment 
we are also able to respond nimbly when opportunities arise  as demonstrated with our past ramp up on defense initiatives 
we remain focused on keeping costs aligned with sales levels and are continuing efforts to identify cost reduction opportunities 
the relocation of our crimson aerials operations into a more efficiently laid out facility that will improve operating performance and allow expansion into the major apparatus refurbishment business 
the introduction of the foot legend aerial  which expands the legend product line and introduces a very cost competitive truck in the large foot segment of the aerial market 
crimson fire s introduction of the transformer as displayed at the april fire department instructors conference fdic  the largest emergency response show in north america 
the transformer is a revolutionary new product that allows for an added square feet of compartment storage space with the relocation of the pump house and a new integrated pump control system that increases flexibility for pump discharges 
the transformer also provides new vehicle packaging solutions needed for emission engines  while improving maneuverability with its shorter wheelbase 
the recently announced spartan force 
a new model fire truck cab and chassis that features a pre configured purpose built body  strategically priced as an affordable option to departments under strict budget constraints  while still providing the content and quality expected from a custom chassis 
increased aftermarket parts and assemblies capabilities for all of our markets 
the realization of synergies in connection with our acquisition of utilimaster on november   including the achievement of purchasing leverage for raw materials and other supplies and enhanced joint research and development efforts 
development of the reach ngcv in tandem with our alliance with isuzu 
this is a big part of our investment for growth into the service and delivery market  as significant levels of research and development spending on this project continues 
these new vehicles will offer quality and durability with improved functionality and fuel economy resulting in a product that is expected to have high acceptance in this market 
strategic fabrication at spartan chassis 
we believe that we can improve operating margins and throughput and reduce supply chain delays by implementing limited strategic fabrication activities at our charlotte facilities 
the growing strength of the spartan brands  including spartan chassis  crimson fire  and utilimaster 
although the overall economy continues to recover  we believe that the slow pace of recovery along with tightening budget environments for state and local governments will make challenging  for both sales and net earnings 
we expect that revenue from our fire truck chassis and aftermarket parts and assemblies businesses will decrease from  due to strained municipal budgets and declining aftermarket parts and assemblies sales related to our defense products 
these decreases are expected to be partially offset by gains in service and delivery vehicles as production of the reach ngcv begins in the latter half of and assembly of the isuzu n series gasoline trucks begins during the first quarter 
we expect the reach ngcv to have a positive but modest impact on our revenue and earnings due to the late year introduction and ramp up  with significant impact in and beyond 
in light of the difficult economic environment that we expect in  we will continue to focus on cost containment in order to maximize our net income  while continuing to invest in our future by supporting research and development for new product innovations and investing in information systems and infrastructure needed to maximize efficiencies and take advantage of future growth opportunities 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about our financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of our consolidated statements of income  as a percentage of revenues year ended december  of sales sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income other expense  net earnings before taxes on income taxes on income net earnings from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net earnings we acquired utilimaster on november  a key metric in measuring our success is our return on invested capital roic 
we define roic as operating income from continuing operations  less taxes on income from continuing operations  divided by total shareholders equity 
roic for the year ended december  was  a basis point decrease as compared to roic of in due to declines in our operating performance as discussed below 
during and  the company has undergone restructuring activities  pertaining to continuing operations  to help align expenses with current and future revenue expectations 
restructuring charges incurred in the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
excluding all restructuring costs incurred  adjusted operating income was and of sales while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the aforementioned adjusted non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures  adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings per share or operating income under gaap 
these adjusted measures have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income  in the future additional expenses may be incurred similar to the adjustments in this presentation 
this presentation of adjusted measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items 
these limitations are compensated by providing equal prominence of gaap results and using adjusted measures only as a supplement 
the following table reconciles operating income to adjusted operating income and earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  operating income add back restructuring charges adjusted operating income adjusted operating income as a percent of sales earnings per share from continuing operations diluted add back restructuring charges adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased by million or from million in to million in the increase was mainly due to the acquisition of utilimaster on november  excluding utilimaster  sales fell million or from million in to million in this decrease is mainly attributed to a million decrease in sales of aftermarket parts and assemblies  primarily due to lower sales of defense related service parts 
helping to offset the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies was a million increase in motor home revenues from million in to million in  reflecting improving market conditions for motor homes 
there were no significant changes associated with pricing on our products 
cost of products sold  excluding restructuring charges  increased by million or from million in to million in the main driver of this increase was the increased sales volume related to the utilimaster acquisition 
excluding utilimaster and restructuring charges  cost of products sold decreased by million or  largely reflecting the reduced sales levels 
cost of products sold as a percent of revenue increased by percentage points from of sales in to of sales in due to a change in the mix of products sold 
sales in included a larger percentage of higher margin products such as aftermarket parts and assemblies  as compared to which included a higher proportion of sales from lower margin service and delivery vehicles and motor home chassis 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from in to in due to the product mix change discussed above 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million in this increase is due to the acquisition of utilimaster in as a percent of sales  operating expenses decreased basis points from in to in excluding the impact of utilimaster  operating expenses decreased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating expense excluding utilimaster is a reflection of our continued focus on realigning our cost structure see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
while we have successfully reduced operating expenses in  we continue to emphasize product development  spending million on research and development for new product innovations including the reach ngcv that we are developing in partnership with isuzu  along with continued development on cab and chassis related to the emissions compliant engines 
income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in due to the decrease in income from continuing operations  along with a decrease in our effective tax rate 
our effective rate for decreased to compared to in  which was mainly due to higher research and development tax credits applied for in as compared with see note  taxes on income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding our income taxes 
net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased million or from million in to million in as a result of the factors discussed in the paragraphs above 
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations decreased by from in to in net loss from discontinued operations increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations in included charges to write down the assets of our road rescue  inc subsidiary to their estimated market values  and was partially offset by a million after tax gain on the sale of substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary  which was recorded during the third and fourth quarters of loss per diluted share from discontinued operations increased by from in to in due mainly to the charges incurred in to write down the assets of road rescue  inc  along with expenses incurred in related to the sale 
net earnings for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in on a per diluted share basis net earnings decreased by from in to in due to the factors discussed in the paragraphs above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales decreased significantly by million to million from million in the decrease was largely due to a million decrease in the specialty vehicles segment sales which was partially offset by a million sales increase from the november  acquisition of utilimaster 
the majority of the sales decrease in our specialty vehicles segment was driven by the reduction in our specialty vehicle sales volume  which decreased by million from million to million year over year 
this change was primarily due to the completion of orders shipped under the mine resistant ambush protected mrap program in this was a unique large defense contract that specifically affected sales levels beginning in and through see item a risk factors relating to government contracts for more details 
the decrease in specialty vehicles sales was partially offset by an increase in sales of fire truck bodies  which were up over the prior year 
the higher fire truck bodies sales driven by higher order intake at the end of  was in part due to the engine emissions change 
there were no significant changes associated with pricing on our products 
cost of products sold decreased as a percent of sales from to due primarily to sales mix 
sales mix included higher aftermarket parts and assemblies sales during which have lower overhead and labor costs associated with them  along with higher sales volumes in fire truck bodies which resulted in improved margins through increased efficiencies and overhead absorption 
these savings more than offset the additional million from restructuring charges incurred during gross profit as a percent of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the same time period in primarily due to higher volumes on the increased service parts and fire truck bodies sales noted above 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of this is primarily a result of the large drop in sales year over year 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses in were negatively impacted by a million legal settlement 
operating expense dollars decreased million or  from million to million due primarily to the realignment of the company s cost structure see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k in addition to lower compensation expense for incentive plans in the lower compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the lower financial results year over year  combined with lower staffing levels as part of cost realignment activities 
these savings were partially offset by one time charges of million related to restructuring activities and million related to acquisition activities see note  acquisition activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information 
the decrease in the company s income taxes to million in from million in is primarily due to decreased earnings before taxes in compared to the effective tax rate was in as compared to in the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a non deductible settlement 
see note  taxes on income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding income taxes 
net earnings from continuing operations decreased by million or per diluted share to million or per diluted share in from million or per diluted share in as a result of the factors discussed in the paragraphs above 
net loss from discontinued operations increased by million or per share to million or per diluted share in from million or per diluted share in net earnings decreased by million per diluted share to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in as a result of the factors discussed above 
the company s segments in and prior periods  we segregated our operations into three reportable business segments spartan chassis  the evteam  and utilimaster 
during the second quarter of  resulting from a change in our management structure and the processes employed for allocating resources across the company by our chief operating decision makers  we began reporting based on two newly defined reportable business segments specialty vehicles  which consists of our fire truck chassis  motor home chassis  defense vehicles  fire truck bodies and aftermarket parts and assemblies operations  and service and delivery vehicles  consisting of utilimaster 
the segment financials have been conformed to reflect the change in reportable segments for all periods presented 
for certain financial information related to each segment see note  business segments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
specialty vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales operating income segment assets sales in our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or from to aftermarket parts and assemblies sales drove the majority of the sales decrease  with a million or decrease from million in to million in the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales was mainly attributed to declining sales related to military products  particularly the mrap vehicles that were produced in and also contributing to the sales decrease was a decline in fire truck chassis sales of million or year over year  due to an increase in orders and sales in related to the emissions changes  along with a softening of the overall fire truck market due to tightening state and municipal budgets 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in motor home chassis sales  which increased by million or from million in to million in as the overall market for motor homes showed a marked improvement 
our backlog of orders for our specialty vehicles segment at year end decreased by million or to million in from million in while our backlog decreased in all of our specialty vehicles product lines  the main driver of the overall decrease was a million or decrease in backlog for our fire truck chassis to million in from million in this decrease in fire truck chassis backlog reflects the pull ahead orders received in in advance of the engine emissions change  as well as the softening of the overall fire truck market that we expect to continue into as a result of the tightening of state and municipal budgets 
there were no changes in pricing of our products that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing year over year 
operating income decreased by million or in to million or of sales compared to million or of sales in  due to the decline in revenues year over year  along with an unfavorable product sales mix in as compared to as aftermarket parts and assemblies  which carry higher margins made up a lesser proportion of revenues in our focus on cost containment  which led to a reduction in operating expenses of approximately from to helped reduce the impact of the lower revenue levels and unfavorable sales mix in service and delivery vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage sales operating loss segment assets represents one month of activity due to acquisition of utilimaster on november  sales at our service and delivery vehicles segment ended significantly higher in as encompassed only one month of operations following our acquisition of utilimaster on november  service and delivery vehicles sales represented of consolidated revenue for there were no changes in pricing of our products that had a significant impact on our financial statements when comparing year over year 
sales in our service and delivery vehicles segment for are expected to increase over levels as a result of recent contracts to install keyless entry pads and safe loading systems in large fleet customers vehicles  the reach ngcv which is expected to enter production during the second half of the year  and our expectation for improving market conditions as the service and delivery market tends to be an early cycle business 
operating income was negatively impacted by elevated levels of r d spending  including million related to the reach ngcv 
backlog for our service and delivery vehicles segment decreased by million or to million at december  from million in our backlog at december  included a large fleet order that was filled early in in addition  fleet customers of our service and delivery vehicles segment tend to place large orders on a periodic basis  which can cause larger shifts in timing and volume compared with our other product lines 
fourth quarter results historically  our sales levels have varied from quarter to quarter 
for a description of quarterly financial data  see note  quarterly financial data unaudited  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
we finished with a strong fourth quarter  with sales of million  an increase of million or over the third quarter of and substantially higher than the first and second quarters 
the sales increase in the fourth quarter of is mainly due to sales at our service and delivery vehicles segment  which were up million or more than from the third quarter of  which is attributed to strong fleet sales during the quarter 
offsetting this increase was a million or decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of in our specialty vehicles segment as compared with the prior quarter 
the decreases in specialty vehicles segment sales is due to declines in motor home chassis sales  which tend to be seasonal  along with declines in aftermarket parts and assemblies and specialty chassis  both of which were largely due to defense related sales declines  along with a decrease in fire truck chassis sales 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in fire truck body sales  which was due to a shift toward higher priced units in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of gross profit for the fourth quarter of decreased slightly from the third quarter  due mainly to a less favorable product mix for the fourth quarter  which more than offset the increase in sales volume 
as compared to the first two quarters of  gross profit in the fourth quarter was higher  owing to an increase in sales volume overall  as well as higher volumes in aftermarket parts and accessories  which tend to carry higher margins 
net earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of of million continued the higher trend started in the third quarter  as a result of the increased revenue and steady gross profit levels discussed above  as well as reduced sg a expense as compared with the first half of the year 
also impacting net earnings from continuing operations in the quarter were research and development tax credits that were recorded during the quarter  which helped to reduce our effective tax rate to for the fourth quarter 
sales during the fourth quarter of were slightly lower than the prior quarters of  after excluding the sales of utilimaster  which was acquired on november  sales were lower primarily due to the decrease in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales within the other product grouping of the specialty vehicles segment 
these declines were offset in part by increases in motor home sales which continued to show an upward trend when comparing the previous three quarters 
in addition  fire truck chassis and bodies both showed upward trends during the course of the year 
we believe that the engine emissions change positively impacted the sales increases 
gross profit was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of  showing trend lines down compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were lower volumes of specialty vehicle and aftermarket parts and assemblies sales in the latter half of the year 
in addition  there were depressed margins at utilimaster due to a one time inventory valuation charge of million incurred during december related to the adjustment of the acquired finished goods and work in process inventory to fair market value 
in addition to the items detailed above  net earnings from continuing operations during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by one time pre tax charges of million related to the company s acquisition of utilimaster  exclusive of the million noted above 
sales during the fourth quarter of were lower than the prior quarters in due to the higher specialty chassis sales in the first three quarters of  primarily as a result of military orders that were completed early in the fourth quarter 
additionally  motor home sales were down compared to prior quarters in this same year  due to the stress in the economic market 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by an increase in aftermarket parts and assemblies sales due to increased support of the military units in the field 
the fire truck chassis and bodies sales remained fairly consistent over all quarters of gross margin was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were higher aftermarket parts and assemblies sales during the quarter  which provide higher margins 
this is partially due to the fact that certain overhead related charges associated with aftermarket parts and assemblies are classified as operating expenses 
also contributing to increased margins in the quarter were improved production efficiencies for fire truck bodies 
net earnings from continuing operations during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by a million legal settlement related to the department of justice  in addition to the same variables noted above affecting sales and gross profit 
financial condition balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable increased million or from million at december  to million at december  accounts receivable days outstanding improved from days at december  to days at december   driven by higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of  along with a focused effort on improving our working capital 
inventory levels decreased by million or from million at december  to million at december  this decrease is the result of a focused effort to reduce inventory levels across all of our operations and better align our working capital with anticipated sales levels 
assets of discontinued operations of million at december  reflect the assets of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  which we divested in september the reduction in property  plant and equipment of million reflects depreciation of million  offset by million of capital acquisitions  including approximately million to support the reach ngcv  which is anticipated to begin production in the second half of accrued compensation and related taxes decreased million or  from million to million year over year due to lower compensation expense related to incentive plans 
the lower compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the lower financial results year over year  combined with lower staffing levels as part of our cost realignment activities 
deposits from customers decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  the lower level of deposits is mainly due to the reduction of deposits for pre emissions engines as products were delivered 
current portion of long term debt decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  long term debt decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  these decreases in debt were enabled by our strong cash flows from continuing operations  in addition to the approximately million net cash received from the sale of our road rescue  inc subsidiary 
see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding debt 
other current liabilities and accrued expenses increased million or to million at december  from million at december   due to an accrual for a payment on a supplier agreement along with increases in insurance and property tax accruals year over year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in item of this form k  are summarized in the following table year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities    discontinued operations    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to a balance of million as of december  these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance the company s foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
for the year ended december   cash generated by continuing operating activities was million driven by a decrease in inventories of approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in inventory was part of a focused effort by management to reduce inventory and better align working capital with the reduced sales activity for also impacting cash generated by continuing operating activities was a decrease in customer deposits and an increase in accounts receivable  as discussed above 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in item of this form k for the other various factors that represented the remaining fluctuation of cash from operations between the years 
cash provided by investing activities of million was driven by million in cash proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of our road rescue  inc subsidiary in september see note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for further information on this divestiture 
partially offsetting these cash proceeds was million utilized for purchases of property  plant and equipment during the year ended december   including approximately million for capital equipment related to the reach ngcv  which is expected to begin production in the second half of in we expect to incur cash outlays of million to million for capital expenditures and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of classic fire  llc  expected to be completed on april  see note  subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for further information on this pending acquisition 
for the year ended december   the million of cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by our acquisition of utilimaster in november cash used in financing activities of million during the year ended december  includes utilized to pay down our long term debt  much of which was originated to fund our acquisition of utilimaster in november in addition we utilized million in the payment of cash dividends 
cash used in discontinued operations of million in represents cash utilized by our road rescue  inc subsidiary 
see note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for further information on the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of our road rescue  inc subsidiary 
working capital our working capital is summarized in the following table as of december  current assets current liabilities working capital working capital decreased from to due to a million decrease in inventory  as discussed above  along with the september divestiture of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  which were classified as held for sale and included in current assets and current liabilities at december   on a retrospective basis 
the decreases in current assets were partially offset by a million decrease in deposits from customers  and the november  payment of million of long term debt classified as current at december  the decrease in working capital from to was nominal as the addition of utilimaster resulted in additional working capital of approximately million which was offset primarily by the reduction in accounts receivable balances 
restructuring activities during the years ended december  and  we undertook restructuring initiatives to align expenses to coincide with current revenue expectations 
the actions we took allowed us to maintain profitability despite the fall in sales volumes 
cost reduction measures included workforce reductions  plant and operation consolidations and overall improved cost management 
an increased focus on inventory and other balance sheet items also drove working capital levels down  particularly in light of the addition of utilimaster 
we recorded expense related to these restructuring activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note  restructuring charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information 
contingent obligation in connection with the acquisition of utilimaster on november   we incurred contingent obligations through in the form of certain performance based earn out payments  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
in accordance with accounting guidance  we recorded the estimated fair value of the future consideration on the acquisition date  resulting in a million balance at december  based upon the likelihood of the payments  discounted to the reporting date

critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement note  general and summary of accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of income  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidelines  including those of the sec 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions  revenue recognition occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications  have passed all of our quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery 
all sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we make certain assumptions regarding the risk of uncollectable open receivable accounts 
this risk factor is applied to the balance on accounts that are aged over days generally this reserve has an estimated range from 
the risk percentage applied to the aged accounts may change based on conditions such as general economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts from year to year 
however  generally our assumptions are consistent year over year and there has been little adjustment made to the percentages used 
in addition  in the event there are certain known risk factors with an open account  we may increase the allowance to include estimated losses on such specific account balances 
the specific reserves are identified by a periodic review of the aged accounts receivable 
if there is an account in question  credit checks are made and there is communication with the customer  along with other means to try to assess if a specific reserve is required 
the inclusion of the specific reserve has caused the greatest fluctuation in our allowance for doubtful accounts balance historically 
please see note  general and summary of accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k and appendix a included in this form k for further details and historical view of our allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  such assets are tested for impairment at least annually  and written down when and to the extent impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october of each year  or more frequently if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates  and then discounting the future cash flows at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  we consider current and projected future levels of income based on our plans for that business  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions  and market participant considerations 
when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting unit s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible asset  which consists of our utilimaster trade name  by comparing the estimated fair value of the trade name with its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our trade name based on estimates of future royalty payments that are avoided through our ownership of the trade name  discounted to their present value 
in determining the estimated fair value of the trade name  we consider current and projected future levels of revenue based on our plans for utilimaster  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and the amount of expected future net cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting units and trade name 
the goodwill of the specialty vehicles segment of million at december   related solely to crimson fire  inc  a reporting unit of that segment 
the estimated fair value of crimson fire  inc exceeded its associated book value by as of october   the most recent annual assessment date 
the goodwill of our service and delivery vehicles segment of million at december  related to our utilimaster  inc subsidiary  the sole reporting unit of that segment 
the estimated fair value of utilimaster  inc exceeded its associated book value by as of october  the acquired utilimaster trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
the estimated fair value of our utilimaster trade name exceeded its associated book value of million by as of october please refer to note  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further details on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the general economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  and other risk factors as detailed in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
warranties the company s policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale  and periodically adjust the warranty liability to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects actual historical warranty cost  which is accumulated on specific identifiable units 
from that point  there is a projection of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty agreements 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts and labor for field retrofit campaigns and recalls  which increase the reserve 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
over time  this method has been consistently applied and has proven to be an appropriate approach to estimating future costs to be incurred 
in  there were adjustments to the warranty reserve relating to military vehicles  where the company s specific warranty experience data had been limited to specific data for commercial vehicles in previous years 
therefore  in there was a change in estimate for warranty liability related to the military vehicles to more accurately reflect actual warranty claims made for these specific vehicles 
the impact from the change in estimate during was a million reduction in the liability 
see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding warranties

effect of inflation inflation affects us in two principal ways 
first  our revolving note payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  we attempt to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of our products 
however  we generally do not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into our contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as nine months  we have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets we serve are competitive in nature  and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
we strive to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present our primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this report  we do not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond our control 
all information provided in response to this item consists of forward looking statements 
reference is made to the section captioned forward looking statements before part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the limitations on our responsibility for such statements
