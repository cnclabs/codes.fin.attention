this section provides information necessary to evaluate our ability to generate cash and to meet existing and known future cash requirements over both the short and long term 
references to   and refer to the week period ended january   the week period ended january   and the week period ended december  overview the company we partner with our customers to help them manage the critical documents and processes they need to effectively run their operations and improve the way they communicate with and serve their customers  employees  and stakeholders 
we not only produce printed documents  but we also help companies migrate from paper based to digital processes by providing innovative tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
to accomplish this  we utilize our market expertise to provide products and services including printed documents and communications  labels  nationwide distribution services  consulting  and technology solutions 
we make a measurable difference for our customers by helping them achieve their desired business outcomes 
we assist them with reducing costs  transitioning to more efficient processes  effectively managing their risks  meeting their regulatory and industry requirements  and driving their business growth 
our operations include four reportable segments based upon the primary markets we serve healthcare  financial services  commercial markets  and industrial 
our business challenges advances in on demand technologies have accelerated the adoption of electronic distribution of documents and digital printing  therefore reducing the market for longer run traditional business forms  a legacy product offering of the company 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in recent years have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
we have taken substantial measures to transform our company to be leaders in our primary markets and believe our market expertise and attention to our customers have enabled us to stabilize our business in going forward  we believe our continued success is dependent upon addressing the following key challenges transformation of our portfolio of solutions future pension funding requirements and amortization of actuarial gains and losses expanding market share in core markets and globally investing in our employees 
transformation of our portfolio of solutions traditional business documents and information driven processes are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many printed documents and related services are being replaced or devalued with advances in digital technologies  causing steady declines in demand for a large portion of our legacy product line 
the same digital advances also introduce new opportunities with significant growth potential for us  such as print on demand services and solutions that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
these growth opportunities are particularly enhanced within our four market segments due to our extensive history and experience 
at the end of  we began the process of evolving into a market focused innovator 
in  we transformed from a product driven company to one focused on the key markets we serve  and we aligned management roles and resources to create an intense focus on customer needs within our four primary markets 
in  we continued our transformation and focused on providing and developing new solutions for growth and durability 
a key example is the optimization of our manufacturing footprint and implementation of new workflow and print technology in our print on demand centers 
we transformed five of our regional print centers into super centers  equipping each with high speed  high quality color printing  and in line finishing and bindery capabilities 
in addition  the regional centers and our three largest satellite facilities were upgraded with the latest high speed  monochrome printing equipment as well as wide format pr inters 
advances in production were complemented by new digital workflow technology  which was rolled out across our entire digital print network 
the software allows web based orders to move from customer desktops through the production process with minimal intervention 
it automatically routes orders to the print center most convenient to the customer  which dramatically improves fulfillment times and reduces freight costs for the customer 
these investments create a strategic advantage for us by allowing us to capitalize on growth opportunities in print on demand services 
during the year  we also obtained new patents related to our label and wristband solutions that will benefit each of our market segments 
the patents improve existing solutions by addressing safety  regulatory compliance  and efficiency needs of our customers 
in addition  we purchased the assets of fusion graphics  inc the assets consist primarily of patented in mold label products and intellectual property  including the grafilm in mold labeling system 
the acquisition is expected to allow us to serve a much broader group of customers worldwide and continue to develop new products within our industrial business unit 
building on these technologies  we launched our new grafilm roto in mold labeling product in the fourth quarter of we have also developed strategic relationships with outside partners and invested in additional talent to further drive growth and development of innovative solutions that address the needs of our core markets 
as a result of these investments  we expect to grow and develop many innovative solutions  specifically in the areas of patient identification and safety solutions  secure document solutions  marketing solutions  and industrial in mold labeling 
these solutions address important business needs and are positioned for growth 
we believe our extensive expertise within our markets combined with our continued focus on targeted solutions for those markets will differentiate us from our competitors and produce growth opportunities outside of traditional printed documents 
future pension funding and loss amortization during   and most recently in  our qualified pension plan became underfunded due to weak stock market returns and historically low long term interest rates 
the amortization of these asset losses plus other actuarial losses has resulted in significant pension loss amortization in recent years million in  million in  and million in we expect this trend to continue and that pension loss amortization will continue to materially impact our operating profit in future years 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates over the next three years  we project pension loss amortization to be million in  million in  and million in however  due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty regarding the assumptions used to determine these amounts  actual results could differ significantly from those expected 
the pension protection act of became effective in and increased the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
in response to the weak economic conditions  the pension relief act of pra was passed in the pra provides funding relief specifically for plan years by allowing plan sponsors to stretch out funding over a longer period of time for two of these years 
based upon the new requirements and current estimates  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  with minimum funding requirements in and estimated to be million and million 
we anticipate making contributions in excess of the minimum in in order to lower required minimum contributions in later years 
therefore  we are estimating that actual cash contributions will be approximately million in and and million in our estimates of minimum funding requireme nts are also dependent upon investment return and interest rate assumptions that have a high degree of variability and uncertainty  as evidenced in the recent economic climate 
unexpected gains or losses in asset values or changes in factors affecting interest rates could materially impact the actual required contributions 
in response to these challenges  in we modified our qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
as a result  participants in these plans ceased accruing additional pension benefits in july  and the final pension amounts will be based upon pay and service through june  the effect of these actions eliminated pension service costs for these plans for and beyond  resulting in annualized net savings of approximately million in retirement costs 
in addition  some variability in the actuarial gains and losses of these plans were eliminated as estimates of service periods and compensation levels are no longer required since plan benefits have been frozen 
in  we anticipate shifting our asset portfolio mix to a slightly more conservative allocation to better manage risks and volatility in future required contributions and asset gains and losses 
we expect to continue this trend in the future  with the ultimate goal being to reach funded status 
despite these changes  settlement of our pension obligations will still present uncertainty and variability in our financial results in future years  with the ultimate outcome determined by actual asset performance in our qualified plan  interest rates  and the level of our pension contributions 
expanding market share in core markets and globally in  we continued our turnaround plans to grow market share  optimize operations and earnings  and develop new solutions for growth and durability 
we achieved positive results  as we acquired new customers and expanded business with existing customers across all of our segments 
we continued to advance our market positions by developing key partnerships and alliances  providing us with new opportunities for growth targeted products and increased market share in our legacy print products 
additionally  we continued investing in system and infrastructure enhancements  including a refresh of our web based smartworks platform 
these enhancements provide advanced web based capabilities for our customers  reduce costs  and create operating efficiencies  all of which allow us opportunities to expand our market share through client service and reinvestment in solutions 
as demand for traditional print products is projected to decline approximately per year  the continued expansion of our market share is a key factor to our success 
we believe our current strategic plans will continue to drive further expansion of our market share in the us going forward 
however  since many of our customers have a global presence  we believe we must also increase our ability to provide international solutions 
we are currently evaluating and developing plans for this expansion 
investing in our employees success in meeting our revenue and margin objectives depends in large part on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our focus in  we continued to focus on our customers  creating cost and operational improvements and efficiencies  and cash flow 
as a result of aligning our organization around our key markets  implementing and progressing with our go to market strategy  and creating an internal structure for continuous cost and revenue improvement  we have made substantial progress in these areas 
building on this success  our priorities continue to center around our customers and our five points framework as follows customer loyalty innovation organizational excellence impatient for profit intense governance for return on investment 
customer loyalty we believe the key to our success is our customers 
our intense focus on our customers needs is intended to foster customer loyalty  and we have developed processes and tools to assist in building loyalty  extending our relationships  and measuring and ensuring customer satisfaction 
in  we improved our baseline customer loyalty scores and gained valuable insight to further improving our customer s experience with us 
we will continue to monitor our progress and sponsor additional market focused customer symposiums to further enhance our understanding of customer needs and how we can better serve them 
by focusing on customer loyalty  we are ensuring that we have a clear understanding of how our customers view us and can develop specific action plans regarding the advancement of the business 
innovation our future success will be dependent on our ability to deliver innovative products and services that meet anticipated needs and solutions specific to our customers 
as a result  each business unit has been tasked with innovation objectives 
we plan to leverage our patented intellectual property and integrate our core technology and material science capabilities into new research and development opportunities 
we also plan to continue to leverage third party insight to drive higher levels of performance 
organizational excellence our realignment around vertical markets has enabled us to focus our efforts on providing valuable solutions to markets where we are trusted industry leaders and have extensive understanding of document and information management needs 
in  we continued advancing our market focus  built structure around our marketing organizations for our four segments  continued refining our shared services capabilities  and optimized our customer service centers 
in  organizational excellence continues to be our goal  and we expect to continue refining our processes to ensure that each person and process in the company is aligned with our strategic goals 
impatient for profit our focus on customer loyalty  innovation  and organizational excellence is intended to drive decision making that enhances profit for the company in both the short and long term 
as part of this process  we will continue to critically evaluate costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive and most importantly  generate positive cash flow 
intense governance for return on investment we expect to continue to scrutinize investments in capital  hiring  and projects to ensure alignment with the above priorities 
building on the governance process we have put in place for this key area  we will also implement processes that promote periodic reviews of the success of our investments  ensuring returns on investments are realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available  and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below for the pension plan  fair value measurements  deferred taxes  inventories  and environmental liabilities generally do not affect segment results 
however  changes in revenue recognition could impact individual segment results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation and certain components of pension benefit costs is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long ter m investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and will continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our non qualified pension benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost 
we review the assumptions used to account for our pension obligations and benefit cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate used for pension obligations holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
net periodic pension benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets the discount rate was through march  and april through december due to settlements that occurred on march  as a result  pension expense was adjusted to reflect the updated discount rate at that time 
holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease pension cost by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase pension cost by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase pension benefit cost by million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  due to changes expected in the asset allocation 
we expect this rate to continue to decline in future years as we continue plans to minimize our risks and variability in asset gains and losses 
we currently have approximately million of actuarial losses  net of deferred tax benefit  related to our pension plans that will be amortized to expense in future years 
we expect amortization expense to trend higher in future periods based on current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates 
due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty in these assumptions  actual results could differ significantly 
goodwill during the second quarter of  we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill 
the test was performed at the reporting unit level using the two step approach required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the first step of the test required us to compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the assets assigned to those reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
to determine fair value  we followed an income approach utilizing a discounted future cash flow methodology 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units required us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions 
in addition  we made certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
though we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual financial results could be different due to unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
the following describes the key assumptions used in our fair value calculations revenue and cost assumptions using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we projected revenue for the remainder of through factory cost and revenue forecasts were from our three year strategy analysis which was performed based on both historical information and the company s current strategic plan 
a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream based on the three year cash flow 
we calculated three outcomes a most likely  a best case  and a worst case based on future cash flow projections 
all outcomes were weighted to arrive at an overall projected cash flow 
discount rate determination we used the industry weighted average cost of capital that reflects the weighted average return on debt and equity of our peer group from a market participant perspective 
the results of our test indicated that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired and no further testing was performed 
in addition to calculating a range of possible outcomes  we also performed a sensitivity analysis designed to understand the relative impact of the major assumptions used in our calculations 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or there was a variation in either the terminal value or the discount rate  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans  tax planning strategies  and other expectations about future outcomes 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
we review the potential future tax benefits of all deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
our review includes consideration of historical and projected future operating results  reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the eligible carryforward period of each deferred tax asset to determine whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
included in deferred tax assets at january  are unused us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million million in deferred tax assets  generally expiring from through based on the weight of available evidence  including the potential sources of taxable income  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these losses will be utilized 
as such  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for the tax benefit of these losses 
we have established valuation allowances for canadian capital loss carryforwards of approximately million million in deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized 
should future taxable income be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
inventories under the dollar value last in first out lifo inventory method  similar items of inventory are aggregated to form inventory pools 
increases and decreases in a pool are identified and measured in terms of the total dollar value of inventory in the pool 
the use of indices is an integral part of the dollar value lifo method 
using the link chain technique  a cumulative index is used to convert deflate year end inventories priced at current cost to base year cost and to convert inflate an increment stated at base year cost back to lifo cost 
under both techniques  indices are developed by pricing all inventory items twice 
in other words  inventory quantities on hand at the end of the current year are priced at current year current costs and at prior year current costs 
this ratio of costs is then used to adjust the cumulative index at the end of the preceding year to a new cumulative index 
the total curre nt cost of current year end inventories is next converted to total base year cost by means of the new cumulative index 
the net change in inventory is then determined by comparing the total inventory at base year cost at the beginning and the end of the current year 
lifo values are determined  by layer  by applying the applicable cumulative index to the increments stated at base year cost 
we evaluate the lifo calculation each quarter and record an adjustment  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our inventories and product mix and our merchandise mix 
we believe the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics producer price indices or other published indices 
should actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances at the end of any fiscal year differ materially from our interim estimates  changes could occur that would materially affect our consolidated statement of income for that year 
at january   a increase in our cumulative index percentage would have increased our lifo expense approximately million or approximately million after tax 
conversely  a decrease in our cumulative index percentage would have decreased our lifo expense by approximately million or approximately million after tax 
environmental remediation we are currently involved in the remediation of three environmental sites that are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards for environmental liabilities  we have recorded an estimate of the total costs to remediate these sites 
however  due to the lengthy nature in settling environmental obligations and the fact that final remedies have not been determined for two of the sites  determining total costs requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
areas requiring the most significant judgments and estimates include the extent and timing of final remediation actions and the estimation of our share of the final remedy 
due to the complexity of environmental issues  monitoring costs can extend for many years 
we must also estimate all costs related to the final remedy  which frequently involves complex procedures that can vary significantly from original plans depending on actua l conditions encountered on the site 
until final remediation approaches are approved and final agreements are reached among all prps  it is reasonably possible that one or more of these factors could change our estimates  however  we are unable to determine the impact at this time 
revenue recognition we enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as software  professional services  and ongoing maintenance and post contract customer support 
we account for the licensing of software arrangements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards for software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or servic es are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for   and segment operating results an analysis of revenue  cost of sales  gross margin  and operating income by segment 
consolidated summary the following summarizes our consolidated results for   and in addition  the table presents non gaap net income  which is a non gaap financial measure and represents net income excluding pension loss amortization  pension settlements  restructuring charges  and asset impairments 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe that this non gaap financial measure enhances the understanding of our results of operations due to the non operational nature of the excluded items and the significant and varying effec t they have on our reported results from period to period 
this presentation is consistent with the manner in which our board of directors establishes incentives and internally evaluates performance 
consolidated results change change revenue cost of sales gross margin gross margin of sales sg a expense pension curtailments and settlements restructuring and asset impairment environmental remediation other expense  net income loss from continuing operations before taxes income tax expense benefit rate income loss from continuing operations non gaap net income income loss from continuing operations adjustments pension loss amortization pension settlement losses restructuring and asset impairment income tax effect of adjustments at statutory tax rates non gaap net income includes impairment recorded in other income in  the company s revenue was under pressure from several aspects 
volatile economic conditions led to weaker pricing in an already over supplied and competitive industry as our customers were forced to seek cost savings in their own operations to remain viable 
adoption of digital technologies also continued to erode revenues from traditional print as expected within the industry  but did so at an accelerated rate as customers transitioned to available digital technologies as a means to further reduce costs 
additionally  a portion of our revenues are derived from industrial manufacturing customers who were particularly affected by the downturn in the economy 
the declining consumer demand in this market translated to lower unit sales as manufacturing customers reduced their production in response 
during  we executed our plans to grow market share  transform our product portfolio  and optimize earnings 
we achieved positive results as we acquired new customers and expanded business with existing customers across all of our segments 
we continued to advance our market positions by developing key partnerships and alliances  providing us new opportunities for growth targeted products and increased market share in our traditional print products 
we remained focused on transforming our product portfolios within all of our segments and recently launched new solutions 
economic conditions also showed improvement across our markets  which corresponded to increased order levels 
however  customers continued to focus on cost containment  resulting in pressure on price 
additionally  cost reduction initiatives implemented by our customers were the primary driver for declined use of certain legacy print products  as technology w as utilized to reduce or eliminate the need for printed products 
we continued cost improvement efforts through our structured internal cost improvement process which positively impacted year to date earnings 
we optimized our manufacturing footprint and continued to transform our product portfolio by implementing new workflow and print technology in our centers 
additionally  we continued investing in system and infrastructure enhancements  including a refresh of our web based smartworks platform 
as a result of these efforts  we stabilized revenue  improved our cost structure  and enhanced our capabilities and operations 
excluding the extra week of revenue in of approximately million  the revenue decline was only million or in  compared to a revenue decline of million or in the gross margin percentages improved in both years despite the declines in revenue  and we returned to positive net income in adjusted operating income was lower in as compared with due to the reinvestments in our infrastructure 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales due to units  price  and mix for and includes weeks 
revenue change cost of sales change units price mix revenue the acquisition of new customers  expansion of new business with existing customers  and an upward trend in order levels due to improved economic conditions drove improvement in our unit sales during these positive trends resulted in stabilized unit levels as the year progressed 
however  due to the significant erosion in volume that occurred during  units remained at slightly lower levels 
excluding the extra week of revenue in  the unit decline in was only 
revenue increased in growth targeted products such as marketing solutions  technology solutions  and industrial labels  however  revenue declines in our traditional print products continued to offset these gains 
declines in pricing in were driven by intense price competition and customer efforts to minimize costs  particularly in our commercial markets segment which operates in highly competitive market conditions 
we expect customers across all of our segments to remain focused on costs as a slow recovery in the economy continues 
while pricing on the supply side was stable in  we began experiencing increased material costs during we have successfully passed through these costs  which offset pricing pressures during the year 
therefore  despite continued competitive pressures  the overall impact of supply side price volatility was neutral 
price competition and a slow economy may delay or hinder our ability to fully recover these costs in future periods 
in  lower units accounted for a decline of approximately in consolidated revenues 
the unit decline was lessened by the extra week in our fiscal year that contributed approximately million and by higher revenue from new customer contracts 
because of our intense customer focus  we extended our services or increased our customer base across all of our segments and substantially maintained our existing customer base during the year 
pricing increased for the pass through of our material costs at a lower rate in  as our material prices stabilized during the year 
combined with increased levels of pricing concessions  overall pricing in declined 
cost of sales and gross margin as shown in the table  the decline in cost of sales in was driven primarily by units and price 
units declined due to the overall decrease in sales volume 
we estimate that the reduction in production costs through our restructuring actions  workforce reductions  and cost reduction initiatives taken during accounted for substantially all of the decline in price 
in addition  as we continued to actively reduce our inventories  some of our lifo inventory layers were liquidated contributing to a favorable lifo adjustment in cost of sales of approximately million 
cost reductions were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix 
due to increased opportunities in certain marketing solutions resulting  product mix shifted from some lower cost internally produced products to other higher cost products that are primarily outsourced 
the gross margin percentage in remained consistent with  despite the decline in revenue 
we expect to continue to realize additional production cost savings through our internal cost improvement processes 
in  cost of sales decreased  primarily driven by the decline in units from lower sales volume 
we initiated restructuring actions in and to create operating efficiencies and to reduce production costs and continued to realize savings from these actions of approximately  allowing us to maintain a steady gross margin percentage as compared with despite declines in sales volume 
we also experienced a favorable lifo adjustment of approximately million  or 
these savings were offset slightly by increases in material prices 
selling  general and administrative expense selling and sales support research and development general and administrative expense depreciation amortization of pension net actuarial losses other pension and postretirement expense total selling  general and administrative expense selling and sales support decreased million in and million in in  our cost reduction initiatives reduced expenses approximately million  primarily in compensation related expenses  communication service costs  and facility costs 
reductions in communication service costs were enabled in large part by the increased infrastructure investments reported in general and administrative expenses 
product management costs on key priority solutions  new deal support costs in client satisfaction  and business development costs were higher by approximately million as we moved forward with planned investments related to our go to market strategy 
the decrease in selling and sales support in as compared with was primarily a result of prior restructuring actions  lower incentive compensation due to reduced revenue  and lower travel related expenses 
our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives have resulted in steady declines in general and administrative expenses 
however  planned investments and increased compensation and related expenses outpaced these savings in investments in system infrastructure projects accounted for an increase of approximately million  of which approximately million was focused on advancing our client facing technology through smartworks 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due to lower compensation and related expenses  despite a week fiscal year in  and reductions in healthcare  travel and professional services expenses 
amortization of pension net actuarial losses increased in as expected due to significant net actuarial losses recorded in recent years that are required to be amortized in future periods 
amortization trended lower in primarily as a result of the settlements that occurred in  which are more fully discussed under pension curtailments and settlements 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates over the next three years  we project pension loss amortization to be million in  million in  and million in primarily as a result of plan modifications  other pension and postretirement costs declined in and due to the decrease in the expected rate of return assumption used for our qualified plan in  we expect pension costs to increase approximately million in we expect this rate to continue to decline in future years as we continue plans to minimize our risks and variability in asset gains and losses 
pension curtailments and settlements a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial losses at the date of the settlement 
we recorded non cash settlement charges of million in as a result of employees retiring and electing lump sum payments of their benefits related to our qualified  non qualified and supplemental executive retirement plans 
restructuring and other exit costs the company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies  reduce costs  and maintain a strong financial condition 
we recorded million  million  and million of restructuring and other exit costs in   and related to these savings initiatives 
we intend to continue to critically evaluate operations and costs and may initiate additional cost reducing initiatives or restructurings in the future 
plans in  we launched a company wide review of business practices and growth acceleration opportunities designed around the priorities of client satisfaction  cost reduction  and increased market coverage 
as a result  we implemented a restructuring plan and numerous organizational improvements to simplify business  move closer to the customer  grow revenue  and improve overall efficiency of our business 
during the latter part of and throughout  we have optimized our manufacturing footprint by investing in regional print on demand centers  scaling down local print on demand centers  closing certain production and distribution centers  improving our supply chain  and simplifying processes 
proactively addressed the movement to digital technologies and managed working capital more effectively by moving to more on demand based production  which has lowered our inventory and warehousing requirements repositioned and refined our go to market organization to capture revenue growth in core markets invested in system enhancements making it easier to serve customers employed strategic procurement processes and systems that leverage vendor relationships company wide 
we expect to continue implementation through  however  the majority of our plans were completed in when fully implemented  we expect to achieve cost savings between and million  on an annual run rate basis compared with the fourth quarter of  and are currently on track to realize all of these savings 
we expect to have involuntary termination costs of million for severance and outplacement services  contract termination costs of million for leased facilities  and other associated costs of million  primarily for fees to the third party that assisted with the development and implementation of our plan and for costs to relocate equipment and inventory 
plans in  we initiated several actions in order to create efficiencies and reduce costs 
we closed two print centers and one distribution center and integrated two other print centers with distribution warehouses 
this move was in response to a changing product mix away from traditional short run offset to increased print on demand and allowed us to reduce operating expenses by leveraging more cross functional roles in production and distribution 
we also redesigned our client support infrastructure to more of a centralized model 
we transitioned customer transactional and administrative functions from our field sales offices to one of three client satisfaction centers 
the overall benefit of the change is an optimized client support model along with significant annualized cost savings 
lastly  we eliminated approximately positions throughout the company in response to revenue declines  soft industry demand for some traditional printed products  and weak economic conditions 
all of the actions related to these plans are complete  with the majority of associated costs incurred in we do not expect any additional costs related to this restructuring plan  and we have realized substantially all of the projected savings expected 
asset impairments as a result of the restructuring plan  we conducted an extensive review of our property  plant  and equipment to determine if any assets were impaired 
the majority of assets reviewed were determined not to be impaired at this time  however  the remaining useful lives were adjusted to reflect updated expectations regarding the use and disposition of the assets 
changes to our restructuring plans could affect the ultimate use of these assets and result in impairment charges in future periods 
environmental remediation we currently participate in the remediation of two environmental sites for which final remedies have not yet been determined pasco site and valleycrest site 
prior to  our expenses related to these matters had not been significant 
however  in  we recorded noncash charges of million for estimated costs for environmental remediation 
of this amount  million related to the valleycrest landfill site 
we had participated with other potentially responsible parties of this site from through in  gm stepped into the company s position under the site participation agreement and agreed to indemnify the company against certain future liability in connection with the site 
therefore  we did not previously record a liability for potential remediation costs 
in  we were notified that in connection with gm s bankruptcy filing  gm did not plan to continue contributions to the site  incl uding its contractual obligation to indemnify the company for future liability 
due to this development  we recorded an estimate of our potential liability for remediation costs 
determining the amount of these costs required significant estimates  as we were in the early stages of developing a remediation plan with other potentially responsible parties  and final potentially responsible parties and their respective shares were unknown 
during  we obtained updated information regarding currently proposed remediation and our expected share of the remediation for these sites 
as a result  we updated the estimates of our total costs to remediate these sites  which resulted in a net noncash credit of million 
of this amount  the pasco site accounted for a credit of million  and the valleycrest site accounted for a charge of million 
as we are still in the early stages of developing a remediation plan with other potentially responsible parties for the valleycrest site  estimates of total projected costs are difficult to determine 
additionally  since the final potentially responsible parties and their respective shares of the remediation costs have not been determined at this time for either site  uncertainty exists as to what our final share of the total costs may be 
therefore  we could experience increased costs in future periods as the remediation processes progress  although we are unable to estimate the amounts at this time 
other income expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared with million and million in and the increase in resulted from higher interest rates paid under our new revolving credit facility secured early in the decrease in was primarily the result of lower debt balances and declining interest rates during income taxes the effective tax rate used to calculate our tax benefit or expense was   and for   and the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows statutory federal income tax rate state and local income taxes change in cash surrender value meals entertainment increase in unrecognized tax benefits adjustment to prior year tax accruals foreign statutory rate differential permanent and other items effective tax rate an increase in our effective rate for state and local income taxes in resulted from state tax liabilities derived from a tax base other than net income 
unrealized gains and losses in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held in a rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan are not includable in taxable income and therefore impacted our statutory and effective tax rates as shown in the table 
the increase in the effective rate in for unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to permanent differences related to the deductibility of executive compensation 
during  our mexican operations became profitable and fully utilized its nol carryforward 
we previously recorded a full reserve for these carryforwards  therefore  the usage of the loss carryforward reduced foreign income tax expense and resulted in the increase in foreign statutory rate differential in segment operating results management evaluates the results of its segments on the basis of operating income excluding restructuring charges  asset impairments  pension loss amortization  pension settlements  lifo adjustment  environmental remediation  and other miscellaneous corporate items

healthcare our healthcare segment serves hospitals and other providers of healthcare and related services 
this market is undergoing fundamental change as advancing technologies and the focus on patient safety and cost efficiencies are transforming how patient information is obtained and maintained throughout the patient care process 
these factors  combined with legislative actions in the us  are leading to a shift from printed patient documents and records to electronic medical records  steadily reducing demand for most traditional print products while increasing demands for digital document solutions and safety products 
poor economic conditions  particularly during  have also negatively impacted customers in this market leading to delays in capital projects  increased pricing pressures  and reduced demand 
since reorganizing around our markets in  we have continued to build on our extensive expertise in healthcare and address the needs of our customers in this changing market by focusing on solutions that ease the transition to electronic medical records  enhance patient care and safety  and reduce overall costs 
we have also taken efforts to increase our market share by extending existing solutions to current customers  securing additional gpo agreements  and creating strategic partnerships 
as a result of our market focus  we acquired new customers through our gpo agreement with novation and expanded our offerings to existing customers in revenue from some growth targeted solutions also increased 
patient information solutions revenue increased approximately and marketing and training solutions increased approximately as compared with despite this expansion however  healthcare revenue declined million or in compared with the lack of an extra week in as compared with contributed to million or of the decline 
additionally  administrative and clinical forms revenue  which currently accounts for approximately half of our revenue  continued to erode at a faster pace than our expansion rate  accounting for approximately of the revenue decline 
growth in our wristband solutions that was expected to partially offset these declines in was not realized due in part to limitations under our existing gpo agreements 
in  healthcare revenue declined million or as compared with  with the extra week of revenue in lessening the overall revenue decline realized 
the largest declines were in our administrative and clinical forms  which were offset in part by increases in our patient communications  wristbands  and secure prescriptions 
weak economic conditions were a leading factor in this decline  as our customers focused on cost containment  sought price concessions  and delayed or reduced order levels 
the proliferation of technology also negatively affected revenue and accounted for a significant portion of the overall revenue decline as some customers utilized technology to produce or eliminate the need for some of the products we provide 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales due to units and price for and includes weeks 
changes in product mix did not materially contribute to the changes in revenue and cost of sales 
revenue change cost of sales change units price compared to revenue during  units increased as we continued efforts to retain and expand our customer base by pursuing new opportunities provided by the novation contract secured late in and by expanding sales in growth targeted solutions 
however  these increases were offset by declines in our administrative and clinical forms due to adoption of digital technologies and lower than expected rates of expansion in label and wristband products 
additionally  of the unit decline related to the lack of an additional week in as compared with the decrease in pricing in is primarily the result of an increase in discounts related to new customers acquired as a result of new gpo agreements  as well as other new customers 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased in due to units from lower sales volume 
material prices increased approximately  however  lower production expenses realized from our cost reduction initiatives more than offset these costs 
as a result  the gross margin percentage for remained consistent with despite lower revenue 
operating income operating income was down million in compared with the decline resulted from lower sales volume and higher sg a costs 
compensation related selling expenses declined substantially in from sales optimization initiatives implemented as a result of our structured cost improvement processes 
however  these savings were offset by planned investments in technology sales and product management costs 
compared to revenue throughout  we saw our existing customers restrict spending and delay capital projects which negatively impacted units 
unit declines began improving in the second half of as a result of increases in our customer base  increased sales within our existing customer base for certain growth targeted products  and higher customer retention rates 
we attributed these positive trends to a more focused sales effort as a result of our vertical market strategy 
pricing on the supply side stabilized during  leading to less price increases passed on to customers as the year progressed 
at the same time  price pressures from our customers continued to intensify as they focused on cost reductions 
as part of our supplier agreements with gpos  we provide specified discounts to customers that are members of these organizations 
accordingly  pricing with various member customers decreased in all of these factors resulted in an overall decline in pricing for cost of sales cost of sales declined in primarily related to the decline in units as a result of lower sales volume 
the net price decrease consisted of a decrease due to lower production costs realized from our cost reduction initiatives offset by an increase of resulting from increases in our material costs 
the gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent in compared with due in large part to success in our cost containment initiatives 
operating income operating income declined million in compared with despite declines in volume  the percentage of operating income to revenue was consistent with as a result of reductions in sg a expenses attributable to our cost reduction actions taken in and outlook we are currently the only document management company to have agreements with the five largest gpos 
during  we continued our focus on increasing market share by signing new gpo agreements that will secure our existing revenue base and increase opportunities to extend our market share in traditional product lines 
additionally  some of the new agreements contain provisions that create new opportunities for expanding our growth targeted patient identification solutions 
we also entered into strategic partnerships that will allow us to expand our patient identification solutions in the us and the united kingdom 
we expect demand for administrative forms to continue to decline approximately per year 
however  with continued focus on our customer needs and commitment to developing innovative solutions  we expect increased revenue for the healthcare segment in  with double digit increases in patient information solutions 
financial services our financial services segment operates in a market where advancing technologies and changing regulatory requirements continue to transform the products and services desired by our customers 
the unstable economic conditions in and have also particularly impacted financial services customers leading to consolidations within the industry  intense customer focus on cost reductions  and highly competitive conditions 
these factors have also led to an increase in the adoption of digital technologies further impacting demand and prices for traditional print products 
during  we utilized our extensive experience to continue to develop our product portfolio and address the changing needs of this market 
we expanded sales to existing customers in marketing solutions and also began to expand our customer base 
however  although the economy in general improved in  financial services institutions continued to struggle as economic conditions within this market still remain weak 
as a result  excluding the extra week of revenue of million in  financial services revenue declined million or in compared with expansion of solutions to existing customers and acquisition of new customers increased revenue approximately 
however  these gains were outpaced by declines primarily driven by weak economic conditions  continued technological erosion in traditional product sales  and fewer one time orders in as compared with in  revenue declined million or compared with  despite the extra week of revenue in we estimate that weak economic conditions accounted for approximately of this decline due to bank consolidations  reduced demand  and pricing concessions 
declines were most significant in our specialized print solutions  customer communication solutions  and digital print solutions  while revenue increased in our marketing solutions 
financial services customers aggressively sought price reductions and also in sourced products as a means for eliminating costs 
the remainder of the revenue decline was primarily attributable to the continued adoption of technology 
we believe weak economic conditions were a major factor  as customers focused on costs reductions and considered existing technologies as a way to create efficiencies or reduce costs during this time 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales due to units  price  and mix for and includes weeks 
revenue change cost of sales change units price mix compared to revenue although we increased our customer base slightly and expanded sales to existing customers  units were lower in the lack of an extra week in as compared with resulted in a decline in units 
we also continued to see the effects of the significant erosion in volume with a few customers that occurred during  although the rate of decline was lessened in the last half of the year by growth from new customers as we began to see positive effects from our go to market strategy 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased due to units as a result of lower sales volume in as compared with the decrease attributable to price was primarily driven by our internal cost reduction initiatives and restructuring plans 
these reductions were partially offset by increased costs related to product mix resulting from our go to market strategy for marketing solutions 
some of these solutions are lower margin products that are primarily outsourced at a higher cost than internally produced products 
as a result  the gross margin percentage in improved only slightly as compared with operating income operating income decreased by million in compared with  due primarily to planned increases in selling and administrative expenses related to business development activities and improvements in our infrastructure during the first half of increased costs were offset somewhat by lower commissions on reduced revenue and cost savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives taken in and compared to revenue units declined in primarily as a result of a depressed economy and the continued technological erosion of revenue in our traditional print products 
pricing remained positive in due to price increases for the pass through of material costs 
however  as our material pricing stabilized in  pricing concessions to our customers trended higher  partially offsetting gains from the pass through of our material costs 
cost of sales cost of sales declined in as compared with primarily due to units 
we realized production cost savings  largely in compensation and supply chain costs  of approximately due to our cost reduction initiatives in these savings were offset slightly by an increase in material costs of approximately  resulting in a net decrease in pricing 
as a result  the gross margin percentage increased from in to in operating income as a percentage of revenue  operating income improved slightly in the improvement reflects the realized savings in cost of sales and sg a expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions 
outlook our strategy is to continue addressing the needs of the financial services market for revenue growth  security and regulatory compliance  and improved operations efficiencies 
to do so  we are utilizing our extensive experience within the financial services market  enterprise print management expertise  document security capabilities  and national manufacturing and warehousing footprint to provide new  innovative solutions 
while we project that declines in the demand for traditional print products may continue at a rate of approximately  we expect to continue to expand our market share and grow our marketing  digital print  and customer communications solutions to offset these declines 
commercial markets our commercial markets segment also operates in a market being affected by digital advances 
customer adoption of digital technologies has reduced demand in traditional print products creating excess capacity and increased price competition  while at the same time creating new opportunities for print on demand and digital based products 
additionally  products sold in this segment are heavily weighted toward customer spending on transactional documents  training  advertising  and payroll services 
therefore  a strong correlation exists between the demand for most of our products and the economic conditions within the market and unemployment rates 
during  economic conditions improved  and we continued to focus on our customers needs and the development of new solutions 
these efforts resulted in more stabilized revenue as we extended solutions to existing customers and began expanding our customer base 
however  intense price competition and continued technological erosion in our traditional print products led to a revenue decline of million or  excluding the extra week of revenue in of approximately million 
in  revenue for our commercial markets segment declined million or compared with  with the extra week of revenue lessening the overall decline from year to year 
we attribute weak economic conditions to approximately half of the overall decline 
throughout much of  downward pressures on demand steadily increased in response to the downturn in the economy and the resulting high unemployment rates and customer focus on cost reduction 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales due to units  price  and mix for and includes weeks 
revenue change cost of sales change units price mix compared to revenue units increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions and a small expansion in our customer base 
however  this increase was offset by price declines 
intense competition within the industry resulted in higher discounts on new business  as well as with existing customers 
except for forms  labels  and secure documents  revenue increased across all of our products  with increases in marketing solutions being most substantial 
cost of sales cost of sales increased due to units as a result of increased sales volume 
additionally  costs were higher by due to a shift in product mix from some internally produced products to higher cost outsourced products 
these increases were more than offset by lower production costs of approximately resulting from our workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives 
despite the overall improvement in cost of sales  the gross margin percentage declined in as compared with  as pricing concessions in revenue outpaced the cost savings 
operating loss operating loss for was consistent with despite lower gross margin and increased administrative expenses related to planned investments in infrastructure in this was a result of lower selling expenses  primarily due to workforce reductions 
compared to revenue unit declines in were driven primarily by the downturn in the economy and further erosion of demand for traditional print products due to an accelerated rate of adoption of digital technologies 
we attribute the increase in adoption of digital technologies to our customers increased focus on cost reductions prompting consideration of existing technologies as a way to create efficiencies and reduce or eliminate costs 
units declined at a lower rate during the second half of primarily due to increases in our customer base and increased sales in some growth targeted products 
pricing steadily declined in due to the weak economic conditions and lower material price increases passed on to our customers 
cost of sales costs of sales declined in compared with  primarily the result of unit declines due to the lower sales volume 
additionally  production costs  primarily consisting of compensation and supply chain costs  were reduced by as part of our workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives taken in and these decreases were offset by an approximate increase in paper costs 
a large portion of the unit declines in were in products with higher gross margin percentages which contributed to the decline in the overall gross margin percentage for the year 
operating income operating income declined from operating income of million in to an operating loss of million in the decline in operating income resulted from the reduction in gross margin offset by sg a savings of approximately million 
the sg a savings were realized primarily in compensation costs as part of our workforce reduction and other cost reduction initiatives completed in late and early outlook through focusing our efforts on solutions specific to our customers needs and investing in new talent to support our go to market strategy  we stabilized revenue in we expect to continue our efforts in by expanding in growth targeted areas such as marketing solutions and customer communication solutions 
this expansion is expected to offset projected declines in demand of approximately for certain specialized print solutions 
these declines are being driven by the continued advancement and use of digital technologies  which we expect may reduce the use of some of our products and services 
industrial during  our industrial segment realized double digit revenue growth of million or  even though included an extra week of revenue of approximately million 
throughout the year  we gained momentum in advancing growth targeted products and increasing market share in printed production parts  while economic conditions also improved from the downturn in during the second quarter of  we acquired selected assets of fusion graphics  inc which is expected to enable us to further expand our in mold product line and result in increased revenues long term 
building on the fusion graphics purchase  we also launched a new in mold labeling product  grafilm roto late in this product is expected to meet manufacturer s labeling needs for large plastic products such as storage tanks  kayaks and children s playground equipment 
this segment was particularly affected by the downturn in the economy in  as primary customers are manufacturers of products directly affected by discretionary spending levels of consumers and products supporting the housing industry 
as consumer demand retracted in  manufacturers scaled back their production significantly 
the reduction in demand for our products led to revenue declines of million in despite the extra week in revenue in as compared with although outpaced by the economic declines  revenue from new business contracts continued to increase during the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales due to units and price for and includes weeks 
changes in mix did not materially affect revenue and cost of sales 
revenue change cost of sales change units price compared to revenue the acquisition of new customers and expanded product sales to existing customers contributed significantly to the increase in units during  accounting for approximately of the increase 
improved economic conditions also resulted in increased order levels for many of our customers  which further increased units during pricing increased during primarily due to the pass through of material price increases 
we expect this trend to continue in cost of sales cost of sales increased in primarily due to increased units as a result of higher sales volume 
as volume increased throughout the year  cost absorption rates improved  particularly in our in mold product line 
we incurred higher material costs of approximately resulting from supplier price increases during however  we successfully offset a portion of these increases with reduced production costs of approximately resulting from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
due to these cost improvements  the gross margin percentage increased from in to in operating income improvements in gross margin drove the increase in operating income in although  higher administrative costs and increases in selling expenses during offset some of these gains 
administrative costs increased as part of planned investments in infrastructure and increased costs related to the acquisition of fusion graphics 
selling expenses increased due to planned investments in business development activities associated with implementing our go to market strategy and higher commissions due to the increase in revenue in compared to revenue the unit declines in were primarily the result of reduced demand for our products caused by the slowdown in the economy 
for the year  we experienced overall declines in all of our major product offerings 
in the second half of  we saw a reduction in the number and length of our customer s temporary plant shutdowns 
this trend resulted in a minor increase in order levels later in  which helped to slightly lessen the overall unit decline for the year 
pricing concessions increased and our material prices stabilized in as a result of the weakened economy 
however  overall pricing increased as we more diligently passed through prior year material price increases 
cost of sales cost of sales declined primarily as a result of the significant unit declines in costs increased approximately due to material prices 
we continued to realize savings from our cost initiatives taken in of approximately  however  the savings were offset by increased start up costs associated with our dayton in mold label plant of approximately 
as a result  the gross margin percentage declined for operating income operating income was down million from an operating profit of million in to an operating loss of million in the decrease in gross margin contributed to a decline of million which was offset by decreased sg a expenses of approximately million 
this decrease was primarily related to reduced selling and administrative expenses as a result of our cost reduction actions taken in and outlook our intense focus on our customers needs and continued development of innovative products led to targeted investments in new talent and capabilities in we are continuing our path of innovation in with the development of a new robotics solution  as the use of in mold labels generally requires robotics 
this solution will assist potential customers of in mold labeling who would like to begin to use in mold labeling for their product decoration but do not use robotics or automation in their current molding process 
these investments  combined with growing customer acceptance for label automation and continued focus on our customers needs  position this segment for continued growth in  particularly with our in mold product line 
total revenue from in mold label products in was approximately million compared to million in we expect revenue from this product line to continue trending higher  with total revenue projected to be approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
because our credit facility is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million subject to limitations related to receivables  inventories  and letters of credit  we take the measure of cash flow performance prior to borrowing or repayment of the credit facility 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow and capital structure as the change in net debt credit facility less cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized in the following table  followed by an analysis of the items affecting these elements cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items working capital restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan other net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures acquisition proceeds from sale of equipment net cash used in investing activities net change in borrowings under credit facility principal payments on long term debt dividends paid other net cash used in financing activities net effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash memo add back credit facility borrowed paid cash flow on a net debt basis includes deferred compensation and non qualified pension payments and changes in other non current assets and liabilities 
operating activities cash provided by operations in decreased compared with primarily due to a decline in net income adjusted for non cash items 
this decrease was partially offset by lower restructuring payments and cash received from the deferred compensation trust of approximately million 
in  cash provided by operations declined as compared with due to higher restructuring spending  increased payouts for our non qualified and deferred compensation plans  and lower operating profit due to the decline in sales volume 
restructuring payments were higher in due to restructuring plans initiated during the third quarter of contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million versus million in and million in we have elected to take advantage of the funding relief provisions of the pension relief act of for our plan year 
based upon these provisions and current estimates  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  with minimum funding requirements in and estimated to be million and million 
we anticipate making contributions in excess of the minimum in in order to lower required minimum contributions in later years 
therefore  we are estimating that actual cash contributions will be approximately million in and and million in deferred compensation balances paid to employees and payments of supplementary pension benefits were significantly higher in due to employees retiring and electing lump sum payments of their benefits during those years 
investing activities in and  we continued to limit our capital spending primarily to projects with higher returns on invested capital and those required to maintain operations  resulting in lower capital expenditures 
in  we made strategic investments in our infrastructure and product portfolio  although total capital expenditures in were consistent with part of our investments were in the form of operating and capital lease agreements totaling approximately million for advanced digital workflow equipment integral to developing our product portfolio going forward 
payments under these arrangements will be required over months 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect to continue to scrutinize capital projects and limit spending to projects required for operations and those with higher returns on invested capital 
in the second quarter of  we purchased selected assets  primarily patents  of fusion graphics  inc for approximately million 
the purchase represents an important part of transforming our product portfolio specifically related to our in mold product line of our industrial segment 
we expect to continue considering other acquisition opportunities that further expand and improve our product portfolio 
financing activities in and  borrowings increased under our revolving credit facility 
savings from our cost reduction initiatives  lower dividend payments  and reduced capital expenditures allowed us to substantially absorb the lower operating profit and increased payments under our restructuring plans and retirement arrangements 
improved working capital management  cost savings  and relatively low capital expenditures provided available cash to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million during dividend payments to shareholders were lower in and compared with  as our board of directors elected to reduce the quarterly dividend from to per share beginning in the second quarter of this decision was made after giving consideration to the economic environment and the company s strategy  equity position  and near term capital needs 
the amount of subsequent dividend payments will be determined on a quarter by quarter basis 
it is our board s opinion that capital preservation and prudent investments in pursuit of our strategy best serves the company s long term interests 
our shareholders equity ended the year at approximately million 
under ohio law  a company cannot declare a dividend in excess of its surplus the difference between total shareholders equity and the par value of outstanding shares 
additionally  under ohio law  dividend payments in excess of earned surplus  defined as the sum of retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income or losses  are considered a return of capital 
further reductions in the level of shareholders equity could limit our ability to declare dividends in the future or could result in future dividends being classified as a return of capital 
capital structure credit facility less cash and cash equivalents net debt capitalized lease obligation loan payable total debt equity total capital total debt total capital total debt total capital on a gaap basis net debt increased in due to decreases in cash reserves and an increase in borrowings on our credit facility 
net debt in remained relatively consistent with  despite lower operating profit due to the weak economy and higher restructuring costs 
on march   we entered into a new million four year senior secured revolving credit facility with five banks 
the credit facility replaced our existing million revolving credit facility that would have matured in may as a result  the credit facility was classified as a long term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the credit facility is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  and certain other assets 
the credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below of aggregate commitments or million  whichever is greater 
the credit facility provides for the payment of interest on amounts borrowed under london interbank offered rate libor contracts and base rate loans 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus to based on our level of liquidity 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate plus to based upon our level of liquidity 
we are also required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
such fee is payable at an annual rate of basis points if the unused portion is equal to or less than of the aggregate commitment or basis points if the unused portion is greater than of the aggregate commitment 
at year end  we had million available under the credit facility 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  dividends  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
we believe our major long term cash requirements consist of investing in our growth initiatives aimed at transforming our product portfolio and our pension funding 
while we have taken steps to enable us to adequately fund these items  actual amounts required may be higher than estimated due to the uncertainty in determining the exact amounts needed 
in our judgment  our strong balance sheet could support additional debt financing
