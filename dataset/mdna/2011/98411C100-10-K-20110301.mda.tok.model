item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates that utilize the body s natural nutrient transport mechanisms to improve the therapeutic benefits of existing drugs 
our innovative product candidates  which we refer to as transported prodrugs  are created by modifying the chemical structure of currently marketed drugs  referred to as parent drugs  and are designed to correct limitations in the oral absorption  distribution and or metabolism of the parent drug 
we intend to focus our development and commercialization efforts on potential treatments of diseases with significant unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on central nervous system  or cns  disorders 
each of our product candidates is an orally available  patented or patentable new chemical entity that addresses large potential markets 
our lead product candidate  gabapentin enacarbil previously known as xp  is licensed to astellas pharma inc in japan and five asian countries and to glaxo group limited  or gsk  in the united states 
astellas has filed a new drug application  or nda  with the pharmaceuticals and medical device agency  or pmda  for approval of gabapentin enacarbil as a treatment for restless legs syndrome in japan 
restless legs syndrome is a neurological condition that causes an irresistible urge to move the legs 
in november  the us food and drug administration  or fda  accepted for review gsk s nda resubmission for approval to market gabapentin enacarbil  known in the united states by the trade name horizant gabapentin enacarbil extended release tablets  for the treatment of moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome  or rls 
the fda has designated the horizant nda resubmission as a class response and set a new prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date of april  gsk is also evaluating horizant for the potential treatment of post herpetic neuralgia  or phn  a chronic type of neuropathic pain that can follow the resolution of shingles  and horizant has successfully completed several phase clinical trials for the management of phn in the united states 
in addition  gsk evaluated horizant for the potential treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy  or dpn  and as a potential prophylactic therapy for migraine headaches 
horizant did not show statistically significant separation from placebo in the primary endpoints of these trials 
gsk remains responsible for the development of horizant for rls and phn in the united states  any further potential development of horizant for other indications  including phn to the extent that a product label would reflect a superiority claim  would be conducted by us 
we are evaluating our second product candidate  arbaclofen placarbil  or ap and previously known as xp  as a potential treatment for patients with spasticity 
we have successfully completed a phase clinical trial of ap as a potential treatment of spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury  and in september  we announced our plans to move ap into phase development as a potential treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis  or ms  patients 
based on discussions with the fda  we intend to conduct a multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ap as a treatment for spasticity in ms patients 
patients who complete this study would have the option to enter an extension study to evaluate the safety of ap in ms patients 
favorable results from these studies and preclinical and clinical pharmacology studies could lead to the filing of an nda with the fda under section b seeking approval of ap for the treatment of spasticity 
the section b application would enable us to reference published literature and the fda s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for baclofen  a drug that has been approved by the fda for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from ms 
we intend to initiate this phase clinical program in the first half of we are also evaluating ap for the potential adjunctive treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd  in patients who do not experience complete relief of gerd symptoms while being treated with proton pump inhibitors  or ppis 
we are conducting a multi dose  randomized  placebo controlled phase b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ap in approximately patients with gerd who are incomplete responders to ppis 
we have completed enrollment in this trial and anticipate reporting top line results in the first quarter of we are evaluating our third product candidate  xp  for the potential treatment of patients with parkinson s disease and are conducting a randomized  cross over phase clinical trial of xp in 
table of contents parkinson s disease patients with motor fluctuations that is designed to compare the efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics of individual patient optimized doses of a new bi layer tablet of xp carbidopa to patient optimized doses of sinemet l dopa carbidopa 
we anticipate reporting top line results in the second half of we have entered into development and commercialization agreements with astellas and gsk 
in december  we entered into a collaboration with astellas for the development and commercialization of gabapentin enacarbil  also known as asp  pursuant to which we licensed to astellas exclusive rights to develop and commercialize gabapentin enacarbil in japan  korea  the philippines  indonesia  thailand and taiwan 
in february  we entered into an exclusive collaboration with gsk to develop and commercialize gabapentin enacarbil  also known as gsk  worldwide  excluding the astellas territory 
in november  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with gsk  pursuant to which we reacquired all rights to gabapentin enacarbil outside of the united states previously granted to gsk which excludes the astellas territory and obtained the right to pursue development of horizant for i the potential treatment of dpn  ii the potential treatment of phn  to the extent that a product label would reflect a superiority claim over a currently approved drug  and iii any additional indications in the united states 
gsk remains responsible for seeking approval of the nda for rls in the united states  further development and regulatory matters with respect to horizant for the potential treatment of phn and commercialization of horizant in the united states for all indications 
we plan to enter into additional agreements with pharmaceutical companies when access to a primary care physician sales force is necessary to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates in the united states  for the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside the united states  or to develop and commercialize product candidates that fall outside our therapeutic areas of interest 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to each of our critical accounting areas 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we have current collaboration agreements with astellas and gsk and a terminated collaboration agreement with xanodyne pharmaceuticals  inc  each of which contains multiple elements 
we account for these agreements in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements and collaborative arrangements topics of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or the codification 
we considered a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period that we remain obligated to perform services 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given agreement 

table of contents we account for our current revenue activities as follows up front  licensing type fees 
to date  these types of fees have been classified within the collaboration agreements as license fees  access fees  rights fees and initial licensing fees  and each of them was non refundable and payable in connection with the execution of the contract 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and we defer the revenue with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
milestones 
we assess milestones on an individual basis and recognize revenue from these milestones when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination  or progress towards the culmination  of an earnings process and iii the milestone payment is non refundable 
milestones that are received after all substantive deliverables have occurred are considered to be bonus payments and are recognized when earned  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria are met 
where separate milestones do not meet these criteria  we use a performance based model  with revenue recognition following delivery of effort as compared to an estimate of total expected effort 
profit and loss sharing 
this represents our share of the profits and losses from the co promotion of horizant with gsk 
amounts are recognized in the period in which the related activities occur  and their financial statement classification is based on our assessment that these activities constitute part of our ongoing central operations 
our current collaboration agreements also include potential payments for product royalties and detail reimbursements 
to date  we have not received revenues from these activities 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date by any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 

table of contents fair value measurements we account for the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification 
the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  continue to be valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
as defined in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we apply the market approach valuation technique for fair value measurements on a recurring basis and attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are valued at level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
stock based compensation the provisions of the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification establish accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
in accordance with the topic  for stock options  awards and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight line attribution method over the vesting period 
restricted stock units are measured at the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting using the straight line attribution approach 
the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived  exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
both the expected stock price volatility and the weighted average expected life assumptions were determined using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with the equity based payments to non employees topic of the codification  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  with third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced  and with consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and amortization and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 

table of contents our current portfolio of proprietary product candidates includes the product candidates summarized in the table below 
the table summarizes those product candidates development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the our success depends substantially on our most advanced product candidates  which are still under development 
if we or our collaborative partners are unable to bring any or all of these product candidates to market  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be reduced  if we or our partners are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals  we or our partners will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired and our business will not be successful  we depend on collaborations to complete the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
these collaborations may place the development of our product candidates outside our control  may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us  if we do not establish collaborations for our product candidates  we will have to alter our development and commercialization plans  if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  if third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed  if we are required to obtain alternate third party manufacturers  it could delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates  and use of third party manufacturers may increase the risk that we or our partners will not have adequate supplies of our product candidates sections of risk factors 
product candidate description phase of development estimated completion of current phase related r d expenses year ended december  in thousands preclinical and clinical development gabapentin enacarbil rls restless legs syndrome nda resubmission filed in the united states nda filed in japan pdufa date of april  second half of ap spasticity phase completed  gerd phase xp parkinson s disease phase    other total preclinical and clinical development research total research and development

other constitutes preclinical and clinical development costs for our product candidates that are not directly allocated to gabapentin enacarbil  ap or xp for the year ended december   other expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million and office and facilities overhead costs of million 
for the year ended december   research expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million and office and facilities overhead costs of million 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be critical to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our collaboration revenue consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaborations with astellas and xanodyne 
our agreement with xanodyne terminated in july our net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments and the recognition of our share of pre launch operating losses resulting from our election to co promote horizant in the united states with gsk 
in connection with the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with gsk in november  our share of pre launch operating losses is forgiven up to a maximum of million

revenues in resulted from our collaborations with astellas  gsk and xanodyne 

table of contents the decrease in net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the receipt and recognition of a significant portion of the million milestone payments from gsk related to the fda s acceptance for review of the horizant nda in as a result of our amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk in november  our share of losses from the joint profit and loss is forgiven up to a maximum of million leading to the reversal in of the million loss recognized in the decrease in net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities in compared to was the result of a million decrease in revenues recognized from up front license and milestone payments under our gsk agreement and the recognition of a million charge representing our share of pre launch operating losses of horizant in as a result of our election of the co promotion option 
the decrease in collaboration revenue in compared to was the result of an million decrease in revenues recognized under our astellas agreement from milestone payments related to the fda s acceptance for review of the nda for horizant in the united states and the acceptance of filing of the nda for gabapentin enacarbil with the pmda in japan 
the decrease in collaboration revenue in compared to was the result of an million decrease in revenues recognized under our xanodyne agreement  partially offset by an million increase in revenues recognized under our astellas agreement from milestone payments related to the fda s acceptance for review of the nda for horizant in the united states and the acceptance of filing of the nda for gabapentin enacarbil with the pmda in japan 
we expect revenues to fluctuate in the future primarily depending upon the potential further development and commercialization of horizant gabapentin enacarbil  the timing of milestone related activities under our astellas and gsk collaborations and the extent to which we enter into new  or modify existing  collaborative agreements

the decrease in research and development expenses for compared to was principally due to the following decreased net costs for horizant gabapentin enacarbil of million primarily due to decreased clinical costs  
table of contents decreased net costs for ap of million primarily due to decreased clinical costs  and decreased net costs for our other development programs of million primarily due to decreased toxicology and manufacturing costs  partially offset by increased net costs for xp of million primarily due to increased toxicology costs  and increased personnel costs of million primarily due to increased non cash stock based compensation of million 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain relatively constant with levels 
the timing and amount of expenses incurred will primarily depend upon the extent of current or future clinical trials for ap and xp  as well as the related expenses associated with our development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product candidate manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consisted principally of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  information technology  legal  sales  marketing and human resources functions

we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain relatively constant with levels 
the timing and amount of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred will primarily depend upon the nda approval process for the horizant nda and  assuming such approval  the timing and costs associated with establishing our sales force in support of the potential commercialization of horizant for rls  which we have up to three years to deploy following the potential approval of horizant in the united states under the amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk 
restructuring charges as a result of the implementation of our march restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our workforce  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charges consisted primarily of million of leave of absence pay  severance and healthcare benefits  million of non cash stock based compensation and million of property and equipment write offs 
we do not expect to incur additional charges in relation to the march restructuring plan  and we have made all cash payments in association with this restructuring plan

at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including corporate debt securities  investments backed by us government sponsored agencies  us treasury securities and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation  and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities in and primarily reflected our net loss  partially offset by non cash stock based compensation

we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated milestone payments  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of we have based our estimate of cash sufficiency on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect 
further  our operating plan may change  and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned 
we have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than potential milestones receivable under our collaborations 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the receipt of fda approval for horizant and the timing and success of further studies and trials necessary to secure this approval  if any  the extent of product development funding under our current collaborative arrangements  the cost of manufacturing clinical  and establishing commercial  supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the timing of any milestone payments under our collaborative arrangements  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  including rights related to horizant that we obtained pursuant to our amended and restated collaboration agreement with gsk  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  if any  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish or modify  the timing and amount of our share of operating losses from our gsk collaboration  the timing  receipt and amount of sales  profit sharing or royalties  if any  from our potential products  the cost and expenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any unforeseen litigation  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that complement our business  although we have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 

table of contents if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are  or anticipate that we may be  unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may terminate or delay clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  we may delay our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates or we may curtail significant drug development programs that are designed to identify new product candidates 
in addition  at any time upon advance notice to gsk  we may exercise the right to revert to a net sales royalty based compensation structure and forego the right to co promote horizant in the united states 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings  dilution to our stockholders would result

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu  topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu applies to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that are currently within the scope of the revenue arrangements multiple element arrangements topic of the codification 
asu provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist and how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
asu requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price 
asu eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and also significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified in  fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
as a result  asu will be applied by us on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in april  the fasb eitf reached a consensus on asu topic  milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
asu will be effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
as a result  asu will be applied by us on a prospective basis for milestones achieved starting in the first quarter of fiscal  including the revised clinical and regulatory milestone payments that we are eligible to receive as a result of the amended and restated agreement with gsk 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of asu on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we contract for the conduct of certain manufacturing activities with a contract manufacturer in europe 
we made payments in the aggregate amount of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  to this european contract manufacturer 
we are subject to exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in connection with agreements with this european contract manufacturer 
to date  the effect of the exposure to these fluctuations in foreign exchange rates has not been material  and we do not expect it to be material in the foreseeable future 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
