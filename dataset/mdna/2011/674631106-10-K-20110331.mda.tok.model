item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained herein as item overview we are principally engaged in the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance and maintenance products for boats  recreational vehicles  automobiles and home care under the star brite and other trademarks within the united states of america and canada 
in addition  we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services of these and other products 
we sell our products through notional retailers and to notional and regional distributors who  in turn  sell our products to specialized retail outlets 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition and collectability of accounts receivable 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  the title of goods pass to the customer  and collectability of the related receivable is probable 
for customers for whom the company manages the inventory at the customer location  revenue is recognized when the products are sold to a third party 
in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience  specific customer collection issues that we have identified and reviews of agings of trade receivables based on contractual terms 
we generally do not require collateral on trade accounts receivable 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  at december  and approximately  at december   which was approximately and  respectively  of gross accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur  additional allowances may be required or bad debt expense may increase 

table of contents the downturn in economic conditions over the recent past has underscored the difficult of estimates with regard to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the bankruptcy of a major customer in caused us to incur a bad debt expense of  although we have recovered  and recorded a bad debt recovery in inventories inventories are primarily composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was  and  at december  and december  respectively  which was and of gross inventories at those respective dates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
for the company  the differences are attributable to differing methods of reflecting depreciation and stock based compensation for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the likelihood of a material change in the company expected realization of these assets is dependent on  among other factors  future taxable income and tax settlements 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities  which could be material 

table of contents we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  in which case we would be required to apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized 
we currently do not apply a valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future  valuation allowances may be required 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal and state tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of our income tax returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which could affect our financial results 
trademarks  trade names and patents we acquired the rights to the star brite trademark and related products for the united states and canada in conjunction with our original public offering during march for  the cost of these intangible assets was amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years through december  effective january  and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets now codified in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we determined that these intangible assets have indefinite lives and therefore  we no longer recognize amortization expense 
in addition  our owned joint venture  odorstar technology  llc  owns patents we use in our business 
the company amortizes these patents over their remaining life of years on a straight line basis 
we review the carrying values of the trademarks and patents periodically for possible impairment 
the company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions 
all impairment charge would be recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change  distribution losses  or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired

during the year ended december   the company continued to focus on programs to effectively manage trade accounts receivable 
net trade accounts receivable aggregated approximately  at december  and  at december  while accounts receivable increased  this increase was modest in light of the increase in net sales 
we believe that the comparatively lower increase in accounts receivable is a result of the company s credit policy and collection efforts designed to limit its financial exposure 
inventory was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  or in the increase in inventory reflects management determination to address rising petroleum prices and an anticipated increase in sales during the first half accounts payable at december  decreased to approximately  from  in  a decrease of  the decrease reflects increased cash flow provided by operations  excluding accounts payable and other accrued liabilities

in  we obtained financing in connection with the purchase and expansion of our alabama facility  through industrial development bonds idbs issued through the city of montgomery  alabama 
the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand the facility to accommodate our future needs 
in july  we completed a second idb financing  aggregating million  through the city of montgomery  alabama 
the transaction funded an approximately  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as machinery and equipment purchases for the facility 

table of contents in order to market the idbs at favorable rates  we obtained  from regions bank  an irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under the terms of the letters of credit  regions bank is obligated to pay the bondholders if there is a default by the company 
the letters of credit are renewable annually 
under the letters of credit  we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
the letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
in the first quarter of  both idb s were tendered as a result of the volatility and uncertainties in the financial markets 
at december   the bonds had not been remarketed 
however  on march   the company received notification from its bond remarketing agent that idbs having an approximate aggregate balance of  were sold to various bondholders 
as a result of the remarketing  the interest rate was approximately percent per annum  subject to weekly adjustment  based on prevailing trends in the tax exempt interest market 
on december   the interest rate on the idbs was and the aggregate outstanding principal balance was  on march  the company paid in full the series idbs 
principal and interest on the series idbs are payable quarterly

we do not engage in currency hedging and address currency risk as a pricing issue 
in the year ended december  the company recorded approximately  in foreign currency translation adjustments increasing shareholders equity by  as a result of the strengthening of the canadian dollar in relationship to the us dollar 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times  new product introductions have required us to increase our overall inventory and have resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of reduced inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices 
the nature of our business does not enable us to pass through the price increases to our national retailers and distributors  as promptly as we experience increases in raw material costs 
at december  and through the date of this report  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
we believe that funds provided through operations and our existing sources of financing will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months
