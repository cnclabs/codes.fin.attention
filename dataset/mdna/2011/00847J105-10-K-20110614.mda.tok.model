critical accounting policies  estimates assumptions md a is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies  litigation  and supplier incentives 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company s most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  and promotion of its products 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
no significant adjustments to the company s accounting policies were made in fiscal specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenue from the sale of products ie  server  storage  and point of sale hardware  and software and services 
revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when 
table of contents the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue for estimated discounts  sales incentives  estimated customer returns  and other allowances 
discounts are offered based on the volume of products and services purchased by customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold 
revenues are recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies 
revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled 
a majority of the company s hardware sales involves shipment directly from its suppliers to the end user customers 
in such transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer  and bears credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods 
as the principal contact with the customer  the company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold when it is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in certain limited instances  as shipping terms dictate  revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination 
the company offers proprietary software as well as remarketed software for sale to its customers 
a majority of the company s software sales do not require significant production  modification  or customization at the time of shipment physically or electronically to the customer 
substantially all of the company s software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
as such  revenue from both proprietary and remarketed software sales is recognized when the software has been shipped 
for software delivered electronically  delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software based on the us eastern time zone time stamp 
the company also offers proprietary and third party services to its customers 
proprietary services generally include consulting  installation  integration  training  and maintenance 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized evenly over the coverage period of the underlying agreement 
many of the company s software arrangements include consulting services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
when the arrangements qualify as service transactions  consulting revenues from these arrangements are accounted for separately from the software revenues 
the significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments  and the impact of milestones or other customer acceptance criteria on revenue realization 
if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for consulting services  the revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
for certain long term proprietary service contracts with fixed or not to exceed fee arrangements  the company estimates proportional performance using the hours incurred as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project consistent with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accordingly  revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the proportion of the work performed on the contract 
if there is no sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  the revenues are recognized when final customer acceptance is received 
adjustments to contract price and estimated service hours are made periodically  and losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
the aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs is shown as a current asset 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software and consulting services  then the software revenues are recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting 
contract accounting is applied to arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect the collection of revenues  significant modification or customization of the software  or provisions that tie the payment for the software to the performance of consulting services 
in addition to proprietary services  the company offers third party service contracts to its customers 
in such instances  the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the company bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer 
since the company is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions  the company reports revenue only in the amount of the commission equal to the selling price less the cost of sale received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk  as well as historical trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  net of related reserves 
the cost of inventory is computed using a weighted average method 
the company s inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is expensed in the period such determination is made to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
the company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions  defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
no tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold 
the company s income taxes are described further in note to consolidated financial statements titled  income taxes 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
goodwill is also subject to testing as necessary  if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of certain events indicate potential impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  identified intangibles  and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
the fair value of goodwill and long lived assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model and observed earnings and revenue trading multiples of identified peer companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
the company s goodwill and long lived assets are described further in note to consolidated financial statements titled  goodwill and intangible assets 
restructuring charges 
the company recognizes restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of the company s business  or the manner in which that business is conducted  is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties  and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable 
the company s restructuring reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities that will no longer be used in continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the asset impairments is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a credit adjusted risk free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
valuation of accounts payable 
the company s accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed by vendors for amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the company and confirmation of the claim by our vendors 
historically  the company s estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by vendors 
supplier programs 
the company receives funds from suppliers for product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in 
table of contents accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
share based compensation 
the company has a stock incentive plan under which it may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  time vested restricted shares  restricted share units  performance vested restricted shares  and performance shares 
shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares 
the company also has an employee stock purchase plan 
the company records compensation expense related to stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  and performance shares granted to certain employees and non employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
the fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of the company s common shares on the grant date 
the fair value of stock option and stock settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the black sholes merton option pricing model  which includes assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  dividend yield  life of the award  and the volatility of the company s common shares 
additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share based compensation awards is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements titled  share based compensation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance addressing the diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations

this guidance also expands the required supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted

in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable elements  which is effective for the company on april  for new revenue arrangements or material modifications to existing arrangements

this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands the required disclosures related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable elements 
entities may elect to adopt the guidance through either prospective application for revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  after the effective date  or through retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented 
early adoption is permitted 
the company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or related disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements that include software elements  which is effective for the company on april  the guidance changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software elements and non software elements as follows the tangible product element is always excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance even when sold together with the software element  the software element of the tangible product element is also excluded from the software revenue guidance when the software and non software elements function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  and undelivered elements in a revenue arrangement related to the non software element are also excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance 
entities must select the same transition method and same period for the adoption of both this guidance and the guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable elements 
the company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or related disclosures 
management continually evaluates the potential impact  if any  of all recent accounting pronouncements on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or related disclosures and  if significant  makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements
