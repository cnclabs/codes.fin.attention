item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies estimates of fair value and comparison of financial condition at december  and december  sources of funds general 
our sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  payment of principal and interest on loans  interest earned on or maturation of other investment securities and funds provided from operations 
deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts to both consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
our deposits consist of savings and checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  now and demand accounts and certificates of deposit 
we solicit deposits primarily in our market areas and rely on competitive pricing policies  marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in addition  we solicit brokered deposits when terms and rates are more favorable than those in the markets we serve 
at december   we had million in brokered deposits  of which million were money market deposits from a broker dealer  and million were in certificates of deposit in t he certificate of deposit account registry service or cdars 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
we have become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows  as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
we try to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset and liability management  liquidity and profitability objectives  subject to competitive factors 
based on our experience  we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds 
despite this stability  our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has be en and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions 
under regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  we are required to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against our transaction accounts  primarily checking and now accounts 
at december   heritagebank was in compliance with these federal requirements and  as a result  would have been deemed to be in compliance with a similar reserve requirement under georgia law

although deposits are our primary source of funds  we may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread  when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they meet our asset liability management goals 
since converting from a credit union in  our borrowings have consisted of advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
see item notes and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may obtain advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta upon the security of certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities 
these advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate  range of maturities and call features  and all long term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing 
at december   we had million in federal home loan bank advances outstanding and the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
we have the ability to borrow from securities broker dealers and customers by pledging investments 
these arrangements are known as securities sold under repurchase agreements 
these borrowings can be done on an overnight  short term or long term basis 
as of december   we had million borrowed under long term agreements with broker dealers and million borrowed under overnight agreements with customers 
we also have the ability to borrow up to million from correspondent banks  pursuant to renewable lines of credit 
in addition  we also borrow from chattahoochee bank of georgia on an overnight basis  depending on their liquidity needs 
at december   we had approximately  in federal funds purchased from that bank compared with million at december  heritagebank is authorized to borrow from the federal reserve bank of atlanta discount window after it has exhausted other reasonable alternative sources of funds  including federal home loan bank advances

this activity is conducted in accordance with applicable provisions of federal and state insurance and securities laws 
in  heritage acquired of the outstanding shares of chattahoochee bank of georgia  a de novo bank in gainesville  georgia  for approximately million 
this investment provides us with the opportunity to further expand outside of southwest georgia 
we also participate in loans generated by chattahoochee bank of georgia that exceed its legal lending limits  allowing us to generate loan volume and exposure to the northeast georgia market without incurring building and personnel costs

management considers its employee relations to be good 
how we are regulated set forth below is a brief description of material information regarding certain laws and regulations that are and will be applicable to heritage and heritagebank 
legislation is introduced from time to time in the united states congress and georgia general assembly that may affect our operations 
in addition  the regulations governing heritage and heritagebank may be amended from time to time by the georgia department of banking and finance  the fdic  the office of thrift supervision  the board of governors of the federal reserve system or the sec  as appropriate 
in addition  the regulations governing heritage and heritagebank may be amended from time to time 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act that was enacted on july   provides  among other things  for new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions and their holding companies  including heritage and heritagebank 
in addi tion  beginning in  all financial institution holding companies  including heritage  will be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  including imposing federal capital requirements similar to those imposed by georgia and may result in additional restrictions on investments and other holding company activities 
the law also creates a new consumer financial protection bureau that will have the authority to promulgate rules intended to protect consumers in the financial products and services market 
the creation of this independent bureau could result in new regulatory requirements and raise the cost of regulatory compliance 
in addition  new regulations mandated by the law could require changes in regulatory capital requirements  loan loss provisioning practices  and compensation practices and require holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their financial institution subsidiaries 
effective july   financial institutions ma y pay interest on demand deposits  which could increase our interest expense 
we cannot determine the full impact of the new law on our business and operations at this time 
any legislative or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
the georgia department of banking and finance  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the office of thrift supervision  as appropriate  have or will have extensive enforcement authority over heritage and heritagebank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action  including misleading or untimely reports filed with the federal deposit insurance corporation 
except under certain circumstances  public disclo sure of formal enforcement actions by the federal deposit insurance corporation and office of thrift supervision is required by law 
heritagebank of the south 
heritagebank  as a georgia savings bank is subject to regulation and periodic examination by the georgia department of banking and finance and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
this regulation extends to all aspects of its operations 
heritagebank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to heritage 
see regulatory capital requirements and limitations on dividends and other capital distributions 
state and federal laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lendin g authority and activities of georgia savings banks 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also insures the deposits of heritagebank to the maximum extent permitted by law 
this regulation of heritagebank is intended for the protection of depositors and the insurance of accounts fund and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders 
georgia regulation 
heritagebank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the georgia department of banking and finance 
the georgia department of banking and finance regularly examines heritagebank  often jointly with the federal deposit insurance corporation 
as a georgia savings bank  heritagebank is required to have no more than of its assets in commercial real estate and business loans 
heritagebank is in compliance with this requirement 
our lending and investment authority and other activities are governed by georgia law and regulations and policies of the georgia department of banking and finance 
we are subject to a s tatutory lending limit for aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain common interests 
that limit is of our statutory capital base  except for loans fully secured by good collateral or ample security  which includes real estate with an independent appraisal  in which case that limit is increased to 
our statutory capital base consists of our stock  paid in capital and surplus  capital debt and appropriated retained earnings  which is that portion of our retained earnings designated by the board of directors as not available for dividends  reduced by intangible assets 
we have not appropriated any retained earnings 
georgia law limits our ability to invest in real estate  including a limit on fixed assets of of our statutory capital base  except for temporary grants of authority to exceed that limit granted by the georgia department of banking and finance 
we are in compliance with limitations on our fixed assets as of december  insurance of accounts and regulation by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the federal deposit insurance corporation regularly examines heritagebank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any deficiencies that it may find in operations 
heritagebank generally must notify or obtain the approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation if it or any of its subsidiaries intend to engage in activities not authorized for national banks 
the federal deposit insurance corporation has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation  asset quality  earnings standards  inte rnal controls and audit systems  interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits 
any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan 
heritagebank s deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation  and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
effective july   the basic deposit insurance is  as insurer  the federal deposit insurance corporation imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by insured institutions 
our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended december  were approximately  those premiums have increased in recent years and may continue to increase due to strains on the fdic deposit insurance fund due to the cost of large bank failures and the increase in the number of troubled banks 
in accordance with the requirements in the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the federal deposit insurance corporation has issued new regulations setting deposit insurance premium assessments effective april  and payable at the end of september the new premiums are based on an institution total assets minus its tier capital instead of its deposits 
the intent of the proposal at this time is not to substantially change the level of premiums paid notwithstanding the use of assets as the calculation base instead of deposits 
under this proposal  the bank s premiums would be based on its same assignment under one of four risk categories based on capital  supervisory ratings and other factors  however  the premium rates for those risk categories would be revised to maintain similar premium levels under the new calculation as currently exist 
as a result of the decline in the reserve ratio the ratio of the net worth of the deposit insurance fund to estimated insured deposits and concerns about the expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the deposit insurance fund  the federal deposit insurance corporation required each insured institution to prepay on december   the estimated amount of its quarterly assessment for the fourth quarter of and all quarters through the end of in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter which was due on december  
the prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance 
for purposes of calculating the prepaid amount  assessments were measured at the institution  s assessment rate as of september   with a uniform increase of basis points effective january   and were based on the institution s assessment base for the third quarter of  with growth assumed quarterly at an annual rate of 
if events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount  institutions will pay excess assessments in cash  or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on january   as applicable 
collection of the prepayment does not preclude the federal deposit insurance corporation from changing assessment rates or revising the risk based assessment in the future 
the rule includes a process for exemption from the prepayment for institutions whose safety and soundness would be affected adversely 
the federal deposit insurance corporation estimates that the reserve ratio will reach the designated reserve ratio of by as req uired by statute 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that it determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against heritagebank and may terminate our deposit insurance it if determines we have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
heritage financial group  inc as the holding company of a georgia savings bank  heritage is subject to regulation and examination by the georgia department of banking and finance 
this state regulation includes the imposition of capital requirements and limits on dividend payments 
see regulatory capital requirements and limitations on dividends and other capital distributions 
heritagebank elected to be treated as a savings association for holding company purposes  so heritage also is subject to regulation and examination by the office of thrift supervision 
regulation by the office of thrift supervision 
heritage is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision 
applicable federal law and regulations limit the activities of heritage and require the approval of the office of thrift supervision for any acquisition or divestiture of a subsidiary  including another financial institution or holding company thereof 
generally  transactions between heritagebank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the institution as transactions with non affiliates  and certain of these transactions  such as loans to an affiliate  are restricted to a percentage of heritagebank capital 
in addition  heritagebank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire the securities of most affiliates 
heritage is an affiliate of heritagebank 
under federal law  if heritagebank fails the qualified thrift lender test  heritage must obtain the approval of the office of thrift supervision prior to continuing  directly or through other subsidiaries  any business activity other than those approved for multiple savings association holding companies or their subsidiaries 
in addition  within one year of such failure  heritage must register as  and will become subject to  the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies 
the qualified thrift lender test requires a savings institution to have at least of its portfolio assets  as defined by regulation  in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every months on a rolling basis 
as an alternative  the savings institution may maintain of its assets in those assets s pecified in section a of the internal revenue code 
under either test  such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments 
at december   heritagebank met the test 
georgia regulation 
the georgia department of banking and finance has supervisory and examination authority over heritage 
under this authority  there are limits on the amount of debt that can be incurred by the holding companies  and they must file periodic reports and annual registration forms 
regulatory capital requirements 
our federal and state regulators impose minimum capital requirements on us and the other entities they regulate 
they also may impose higher capital requirements on an individualized basis if they believe the financial institution or holding company is subject to excessive risk 
regulatory capital requirements for heritagebank of the south 
heritagebank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital under regulations of the federal deposit insurance corporation and polices of the georgia department of banking and finance 
these regulations established two capital standards  a leverage capital requirement and a risk based capital requirement 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also may impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case by case basis based on the particular circumstances or risk profile of the institution 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources for information on the bank s compliance with these capital requirements 
the capital standards generally require tier capital equal to at least of adjusted total 
tier capital generally consists of equity capital  with certain adjustments  including deducting most intangibles 
the federal deposit insurance corporation also requires heritagebank to have tier capital of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet items  will be multiplied by a risk weight  ranging from to  based on the risk inherent in the type of asset 
total capital consists of tier capital  as defined above  and tier capital  which consists of certain permanent and maturing capital instruments that do not qualify as tie r capital and of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
tier capital may be used to satisfy these risk based requirements only to the extent of tier capital 
the federal deposit insurance corporation is authorized to require heritagebank to maintain an additional amount of total capital to account for concentration of credit risk  level of interest rate risk  equity investments in non financial companies and the risk of non traditional activities 
the federal deposit insurance corporation is authorized and  under certain circumstances  required to take certain actions against savings banks that fail to meet their capital requirements 
the federal deposit insurance corporation is generally required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized institution  which is an institution with less than either a leverage capital ratio  a tier risked based capital ratio or an total risk based capital ratio 
any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the federal deposit insurance corporation may not increase its assets  acquire another institution  establish a branch or engage in any new activities  and generally may not make capital distributions 
the federal deposit ins urance corporation is authorized to impose the additional restrictions 
any institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or has tier risk based or leverage capital ratios of less than or a total risk based capital ratio of less than is considered significantly undercapitalized and must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and operating restrictions that may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution 
an institution with tangible equity to total assets of less than is critically undercapitalized and becomes subject to further mandatory restrictions on it 
the federal deposit insurance corporation generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsou nd practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
the imposition by the federal deposit insurance corporation of any of these measures on heritagebank may have a substantial adverse effect on its operations and profitability 
the imposition by the federal deposit insurance corporation of any of these measures on heritagebank may have a substantial adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
georgia imposes a capital requirement based on the leverage capital requirement of the federal deposit insurance corporation 
a georgia savings bank must have at least a leverage capital ratio  though the department of banking and finance can impose a higher requirement for the specific circumstances and risks of the institution 
many banks are required to have a ratio to address these specific circumstances and risks  and any bank with a less than leverage capital ratio must submit a two year capital plan with the georgia department of banking and finance 
regulatory capital requirements for heritage financial group  inc heritage is required to maintain a certain level of capital under a policy of the georgia department of banking and finance that imposes a tier capital to total assets capital ratio of  or higher for holding companies engaged in more risky  non financial businesses 
this level is based on the capital requirement imposed on bank holding companies by the board of governors of the federal reserve systems and is similar to the tier leverage ratio imposed on heritagebank 
if heritage fails to meet this requirement  it must file a capital plan and fo cus on reducing its more risky operations  and it may be subject to an enforcement action  including a capital directive 
limitations on dividends and other capital distributions unless it meets certain financial criteria  heritagebank must obtain the prior written approval of the georgia department of banking and finance before paying any dividend to heritage 
those financial criteria are having classified assets of no more than of tier capital plus an allowance for loan losses at the time of its last examination  paid no more than of last calendar year net income in dividends in the current calendar year  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least 
georgia prohibits heritage from paying a dividend if its debt to equity ratio is or more or if it is not meeting its capital requirement 
in and  heritagebank requested and received approval from the georgia department of banking and finance to pay dividends in excess of of last calen dar year net income 
dividends paid by heritagebank were million in and million in no dividends were paid by heritagebank in as a subsidiary financial institution of a savings association holding company  any distributions of capital by heritagebank  including dividends and stock redemptions or repurchases  are subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision 
heritagebank must file a notice or application with the office of thrift supervision before making any capital distribution 
generally  after filing a notice with the office of thrift supervision  heritagebank may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to of net income for the year to date plus retained net income for the two preceding years  so long as it is well capitalized after the distribution 
however  if it proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its current minimum capital requirements or will not follo wing the proposed capital distribution or that will exceed these net income limitations  it must obtain office of thrift supervision approval prior to making such distribution 
the office of thrift supervision may object to any distribution based on safety and soundness concerns 
because heritagebank failed to make these filings in to  the office of thrift supervision has directed the company to obtain the approval of the office of thrift supervision before declaring any dividends 
we expect this requirement will apply to heritage until it is rescinded by the office of thrift supervision 
federal taxation heritage and heritagebank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations  with some exceptions discussed below 
the following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to heritage or heritagebank 
prior to june  heritagebank was a federal credit union and was not generally subject to corporate income tax 
heritage will file a consolidated federal income tax return with heritagebank commencing with the first taxable year after completion of the offering 
accordingly  it is anticipated that any cash distributions made by heritage to its stockholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a nontaxable return of capital to stockholders for federal and state tax purposes 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  heritagebank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on december for filing its federal income tax return 
minimum tax 
the internal revenue code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences  called alternative minimum taxable income 
the alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount 
net operating losses can offset no more than of alternative minimum taxable income 
certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
heritagebank was subject to the alternative minimum tax in and has approximately  available as credits for carryover 
net operating loss carryovers 
a financial institution may carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding taxable years 
this provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after august  at december   heritagebank had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
corporate dividends received deduction 
because it files a consolidated return with its wholly owned subsidiary  heritagebank  dividends from heritagebank are not included as income to heritage 
the corporate dividends received deduction is or  in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return  depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend 
corporations that own less than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct of dividends received or accrued on their behalf 
state taxation heritage and heritagebank are subject to georgia and florida corporate income tax  which is assessed at the rate of 
for this purpose  taxable income generally means federal taxable income subject to certain modifications provided for in georgia and florida law 
heritage and heritagebank also are subject to georgia business occupation taxes computed on gross receipts after deducting exempt income and interest paid on deposits and other liabilities 
the tax rates assessed vary from one municipality to another 
the total occupation taxes paid in was approximately  item a 
risk factors the united states economy remains weak and unemployment levels are high 
a prolonged economic downturn  especially one affecting our geographic market area  will adversely affect our business and financial results 
the united states experienced a severe economic recession in and and continued economic stagnation in while economic growth has resumed recently  the rate of growth has been slow and unemployment remains at very high levels and is not expected to improve greatly in the near future 
furthermore  our primary market areas in southern georgia and northern and central florida have experienced continued deterioration in economic growth and employment than the rest of the country 
loan portfolio quality has deteriorated at many financial institutions reflecting  in part  the weak us economy and high unemployment 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
the continuing re al estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction  residential and commercial mortgage loans for many lenders 
stock prices for financial institutions and their holding companies have declined substantially  and it is significantly more difficult for those entities to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets 
continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
moreover  continued declines in the stock market in general  or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically  could adversely affect our stock performance 
the recent economic recession has been severe in our primary market areas of southern georgia and north central florida  and  if those local economic conditions continue to deteriorate  our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted adversely as borrowers ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing loans decreases 
substantially all of our loans are located in southern georgia and north central florida 
our financial results may be affected adversely by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including decreases in real estate values  changes in interest rates that may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events 
continued decreases in real estate values in our primary market areas could affect adversely the value of real property used as collateral for our mortgage loans 
as a result  the market value of the real estate underlying these loans may not  at any given time  be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
in the event that we are required to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loan  we may not recover funds in an amount equal to the remaining loan balance 
consequently  we would sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher provision for loan loss expense  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
in addition  adverse changes in the georgia or florida economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would also have an adverse impact on earnings 
unemployment levels in our georgia and florida market areas are higher than the national levels 
according to data published by the bureau of labor statistics of the united states department of labor for december  the national unemployment rate for the united states was compared to an average of for our georgia market areas and an average of for our florida market areas 
our two florida market areas are expected to experience significantly smaller average population growth than they have experienced for the last decade 
from to  these market areas experienced average population growth of  but they are expected to experience average population on growth of only over the next five years 
see business market area 
our expansion efforts  particularly through new and acquired branches  may not be successful if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
a key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand our branch network into communities within or adjacent to georgia and florida markets in which we currently conduct business 
in  we expanded our branch network outside of southwest georgia for the first time with two branches in ocala  florida 
in december  we acquired a branch in lake city  florida in a private transaction and two branch offices in southeast georgia in an fdic assisted transaction 
in may  we acquired four branches in southeast georgia and one in southwest georgia in another private transaction 
in july  we opened a de novo banking office in valdosta  georgia 
in february  we acquired four branches east of savannah  georgia in an fdic assisted transaction 
 we intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business 
operating branches outside of our original southwest georgia market and beyond our current market areas  may subject us to additional risk  including the local risks related to the new market areas  management of employees from a distance  additional credit risks  logistical operational issues and management time constraints 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities  and  if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future  including fdic assisted transactions  branch acquisitions  or other business growth initiatives or undertakings 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities  that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities  if undertaken  will be successful 
while we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch net work will be profitable 
in addition  if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired  that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have engaged in two fdic assisted transactions and may engage in more such transactions in the future  which could present additional risks to our financial condition and earnings 
we have engaged in two fdic assisted acquisitions 
these acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks  even though the fdic might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution 
as is typical in the acquisition of a failed financial institution  many of the loans acquired in these acquisitions were non performing and had poor documentation  including a lack of current financial information on borrowers and of current evidence of collateral value 
in december  we acquired a failed bank in southeast georgia in an fdic assisted transaction  including million in loans 
this fdic assisted transaction did not involve a loss share agreement pursuant to which the fdic covers portions of the losses incurred or the assets acquired 
we did  however  receive a million purchase discount paid by the fdic 
the acquired loans had an average term of years  mostly on longer amortization schedules and payments due less frequently than on a monthly basis 
these loans are carried on our books at fair value  based on an estimate of future cash flows  which we review and evaluate quarterly and  under gaap 
because of the condition and terms of these loans  the actual amount recognized by us on these assets could di ffer materially from this fair value  and we also anticipate incurring foreclosure and collection expenses on certain of these loans over the next five years  which will increase our non interest expense 
therefore  we may incur losses on this acquired loan portfolio 
in february  we acquired another financial instituion in east georgia with approximately million in loans 
we entered into a loss share agreement under which the fdic will reimburse for of the losses on covered loans and other real estate owned 
this loss share agreement requires that we follow specific servicing and reporting procedures 
failure to properly follow these procedures or other breach of the loss share agreement by heritagebank could result in the loss of the fdic reimbursement of losses on covered loans and other real estate owned  which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the current economic environment  we expect to be presented with more opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks through fdic assisted transactions 
however  these acquisitions are structured in a manner that does not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition  including preparing for integration of an acquired institution 
therefore  we may face additional risks  including  the loss of customers  strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to ove rcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability 
moreover  even though we are inclined to participate in an fdic assisted transaction  we can offer no assurances that we would be successful in acquiring the financial institution or assets that we are seeking 
changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher than anticipated loan charge offs on assets acquired in fdic assisted transactions 
the fluctuations in national  regional and local economic conditions  including those related to local residential  commercial real estate and construction markets  may increase the level of charge offs that we make to our loan portfolio  and  consequently  reduce our net income  and may also increase the level of charge offs on the loan portfolios that we have acquired such acquisitions and correspondingly reduce our net income 
these fluctuations are not predictable  cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur 
although we have entered into a loss share agreement with the fdic providing that a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in connection with our february fdic assisted transaction will be borne by the fdic  we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios 
additionally  the loss share agreements have limited terms  therefore  any charge off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursable by the fdic and will negatively impact our net income 
purchased loans carry a greater level of risk than loans originated by us 
as of december   million or of our loan portfolio consisted of loans purchased by us through bank and branch acquisitions 
in addition  in february  we acquired an additional million in loans through our fdic assisted transactions 
these purchased loans include residential mortgage  commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans 
although we have performed due diligence on these loans  they were not originated by us  and therefore may not conform to the same underwriting standards as loans originated by us 
in addition  these customers are not known to us  and we do not have a history of performance with these customers 
these loans may have delinquency or charge off levels above those for loans originated by us 
our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our percentage of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans to small and mid sized businesses in our primary market areas  which are the types of businesses that have a heightened vulnerability to local economic conditions 
over the last several years  we have increased this type of lending from of our portfolio at december   in order to improve the yield on our assets 
at december   our loan portfolio included million of commercial real estate loans and million of commercial business compared to million and million  respectively  at december  as a result  we have experienced an increase in non performing commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
see item business ass et quality non performing assets 
the credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one to four family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrowers business and the real estate securing the loans as collateral  which can be significantly affected by economic conditions 
additionally  commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans 
if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired  then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan  which could require us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  as a result of our increasing emphasis on this type of lending  a large portion of our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios is relatively unseasoned 
as a result  we may not have enough payment history upon which to judge future collectibility or to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio 
these loans may have delinquency or charge off levels above our historical experience  which could adversely affect our future performance 
several of our commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or business loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to any one to four family residential mortgage loan 
finally  if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan  our holding period for the collateral  if any  typically is longer than for one to four family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral 
since we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans  it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses due to the increased risk characteristics associated with these types o f loans 
any increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings 
any delinquent payments or the failure to repay these loans would hurt our earnings 
our consumer loan portfolio possesses increased risk 
our consumer loans accounted for approximately million  or  of our total loan portfolio as of december   of which million consisted of automobile loans and million consisted of home equity lines of credit 
generally  we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one to four family  owner occupied residential properties  particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets  such as automobiles 
in these cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance 
because our indirect automobile loans  which totaled million at december   were originated through a third party and not directly by us  they present greater risks than other types of lending activities 
as a result of this portfolio of consumer loans  it may become necessary to increase the level of our provision for loan losses  which could hurt our profits 
our business may be affected adversely by credit risk associated with residential property 
as of december   residential mortgage loans  including home equity loans and lines of credit  totaled million  or  of total loans 
this type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations  making loss levels difficult to predict 
the decline in residential real estate values resulting from the downturn in local housing markets has reduced the value of the real estate collateral securing the majority of our loans and has increased the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans 
in addition  borrowers seeking to sell their homes may find that they cannot sell their properties for an amount equal to or greater than the unpaid principal balan ce of their loans 
continued declines in both the volume of real estate sales and sales prices  coupled with high levels and increases in unemployment  may result in higher loan delinquencies or problem assets  a decline in demand for our products and services or a decrease in our deposits 
these potential negative events may cause us to incur losses  which would adversely affect our capital and liquidity and could damage our financial condition and business operations 
these declines may have a greater impact on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions that have more diversified loan portfolios 
we are subject to credit risks in connection with the concentration of adjustable rate loans in our portfolio 
adjustable rate loans made up of our loan portfolio at december  borrowers with adjustable rate loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the loan to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin 
any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate loans  increasing the possibility of default 
borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by refinancing their loans may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably lower interest rates 
in addition  declining housing prices may prevent refinancing or a sale of the home  because borrowers have insufficient equity in their homes 
these events  alone or in combination  may contribute to higher delinquency rates and negatively impact our earnings 
if our non performing assets increase  our earnings will suffer 
at december   our non performing assets which consist of non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  non perfoming troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed real estate assets totaled million  which was a increase of million or over non performing assets at december  our non performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
we do not record interest income on non accrual loans or real estate owned 
we must reserve for estimated credit losses  which are established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses  and from time to time  if appropriate  we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values 
additionally  there are legal fees associat ed with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs including taxes  insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned 
further  the resolution of non performing assets requires the active involvement of management  potentially distracting them from the overall supervision of our operations and other income producing activities 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience  and we evaluate economic conditions 
management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios  new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  resulting in additions to our allowance 
additio ns to our allowance decrease our net income 
our allowance for loan losses was of gross loans and of non performing loans at december   compared to of gross loans and of non performing loans at december  our allowance for loan losses  excluding purchased loans  was of gross loans and of non performing loans at december  our emphasis on originating commercial and one to four family real estate and commercial business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses 
as we continue to increase our originations of these loans  increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary  resulting in decreased earnings 
our regulators and external auditor periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review 
these increases in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income 
heritagebank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the georgia department of banking and finance and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank s operations  reclassify assets  determine the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change 
any change in these regulations and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impac t on our operations 
in addition  heritage is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the georgia department of banking and finance and the office of thrift supervision 
the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act provides for the creation of a consumer protection division at the board of governors of the federal reserve system that will have broad authority to issue regulations governing the services and products we provide consumers 
this additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely impact our operations 
that legislation also contains provisions that  over time  could result in higher regulatory capital requirements and loan loss provisions for heritage and heritagebank and may increase interest expense due to the ability in july to pay interest on all demand deposits 
in addition  there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrower s are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
recent regulatory changes impose limits on our ability to charge overdraft fees  which may decrease our non interest income as compared to more recent prior periods 
the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations  or changes in policy  affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards 
see how we are regulated 
in this recent economic downturn  federal and state banking regulators have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory agencies  such as the georgia department of banking and finance and the federal deposit insurance corporation  govern the activities in which heritagebank may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors 
in addition  new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations 
new laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our l oans and investments  the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
for example  recent legislative proposals require changes to our overdraft protection programs that decrease the amount of fees we receive for these services 
for the year ended december   overdraft protection and nonsufficient fund fees totaled million 
further  legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected significantly by changes in interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
because interest bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income 
changes in interest rates also may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
also  increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets  which would limit the funds we have available to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives  and may res ult in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates 
changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
at december   the fair value of our portfolio of available for sale securities totaled million 
gross unrealized gains on these securities totaled million  while gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled million  resulting in a net unrealized loss of million at december  at december   the company s internal simulation model indicated that our net portfolio value would decrease by if there was an instantaneous parallel basis point increase in market interest rates 
see the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability management 
our strategies to modify our interest rate risk profile may be difficult to implement 
our asset liability management strategies are designed to decrease our interest rate risk sensitivity 
one such strategy is increasing the amount of adjustable rate and or short term assets 
heritagebank offers adjustable rate loan products as a means to achieve this strategy 
the availability of lower rates on fixed rate loans would generally create a decrease in borrower demand for adjustable rate assets 
additionally  these adjustable rate assets may prepay 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans  compared to at december  we also are managing our liabilities to moderate our interest rate risk sensitivity 
customer demand is primarily for short term certificates of deposit 
using short term liabilities to fund long term  fixed rate assets will increase the interest rate sensitivity of any financial institution 
we are utilizing federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements to mitigate the impact of customer demand by lengthening the maturities of these advances or entering into longer term repurchase agreements  depending on liquidity or investment opportunities 
federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements are entered into as liquidity is needed or to fund assets that provide for a spread considered sufficient by management 
if we are unable to originate adjustable rate assets at favorable rates or fund loan originations or securities purchases with long term advances or structured borrowings  we may have difficulty executing this asset liability management strategy and or it may result in a reduction in profitability 
a tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
a tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth  our earnings capability and capital levels negatively 
we rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands 
our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts  including brokered deposits  as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio 
borrowings  especially from the federal home loan bank and repurchase agreements  also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other so urces could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically  or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated 
our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets  negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations or continued deterioration in credit markets 
our securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value  potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and or earnings 
fluctuations in market value may be caused by decreases in interest rates  lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand 
our securities portfolio is evaluated for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis 
if this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities  a potential loss to earnings may occur 
changes in interest rates can have an adverse effect on our financial condition  as our available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
we increase or decrea se our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available for sale securities  net of taxes 
at december   the change in net unrealized losses on securities available for sale from the level at december  was an increase of million 
higher federal deposit insurance corporation insurance premiums and special assessments will adversely affect our earnings 
in accordance with the dodd frank act  the federal deposit insurance corporation has adopted a new deposit insurance premium assessment system to be effective april   in which assessments are calculated based on all liabilities  not just deposits at assessment rates that are intended to keep current levels of assessments substantially the same 
to the extent we increase our non deposit liabilities or are determined to bear certain additional risk to the deposit insurance fund 
future increases in our assessment rate or levels or any special assessments would decrease our earnings 
strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with numerous commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  securities brokers and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
because of the many recent bank failures in georgia and florida  a number of new competitors that have acquired failed banks have entered our primary market areas 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggre ssively than we do 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and cause e xisting and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  financial condition and results of operations 
the ownership interest of management and employees could enable insiders to prevent a merger that may provide stockholders a premium for their shares 
our directors and executive officers own  shares  or  of the company s common stock and options for an additional  shares 
in addition  our employee stock ownership plan owns of the outstanding shares of heritage common stock 
we intend to ask stockholders to approve a new stock option and restricted stock plan for up to  shares at our annual meeting 
additional stock options and shares of common stock may be granted to our directors and employees if this stock based incentive plan is adopted 
this may result in management  directors and employees controlling a significant percentage of shares of heritage common stock 
if these individuals were to act together  they could have significant influence over the outcome of any stockholder vote 
th is voting power may discourage a potential sale of heritage that its public stockholders may desire 
the implementation of the stock based incentive plan may dilute your ownership interest 
we intend to adopt a new stock based incentive plan following the offering  subject to receipt of stockholder approval 
historically  the overwhelming majority of stock based benefit plans adopted by savings institutions and their holding companies following mutual to stock conversions have been approved by stockholders 
this stock based incentive plan may be funded either through open market purchases or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock of heritage 
while our intention is to fund this plan through open market purchases  stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest in the event  newly issued shares of our common stock are used to fund stock options and shares of restricted common stock under the new plan 
additional expenses from the compensation and benefit expenses associated with the implementation of any new stock based incentive benefit plan will affect our profitability adversely 
if the new stock based incentive plan is implemented  our non interest expenses are likely to increase as we will recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses related to the shares granted to employees  executives and directors under our stock based incentive plan 
we cannot predict the actual amount of these new stock related compensation and benefit expenses because applicable accounting practices require that expenses be based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future  however  we expect them to be material 
in addition  we will recognize expense for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants accounts ie  as the loan used to acquire these shares is repaid  and we will recognize expens e for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 
various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve 
our board of directors has no current intention to sell control of heritage 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  federal regulations  georgia and maryland law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of heritage without the consent of our board of directors 
you may want a takeover attempt to succeed because  for example  a potential acquiror could offer a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock

high low dividends paid per share fourth quarter through third quarter through second quarter first quarter fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter all dividends paid by the predecessor were paid to all stockholders  except heritage mhc  which waived the dividend 
the company intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis at a reduced amount per share from that paid by its predecessor 
the dividend rate and the continued payment of dividends also will depend on a number of factors  including our capital requirements  our financial condition and results of operations  tax considerations  statutory and regulatory limitations  and general economic conditions 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay dividends or that they will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 
the company set a new quarterly dividend rate for following the completion of the conversion and offering in the fourth quarter of the company expects to pay out dividends equivalent to the total amount paid in previous quarters 
on february   the company declared a cash dividend of per share 
the company s ability to pay dividends will depend on net proceeds of the offering retained by us and earnings thereon  as well as dividends from heritagebank 
under the rules of the office of thrift supervision  the company will not be permitted to pay dividends on its common stock if its stockholders equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion 
similarly  heritagebank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the company  its sole stockholder  if heritagebank s stockholder s equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion 
in addition  heritagebank will not be permitted to make a capital distribution if  after making such distribution  capital w ould be below regulatory capital guidelines or if it does not receive office of thrift supervision authorization to pay the dividend 
georgia law and regulations imposes limits on dividend payments by heritagebank and certain levels of dividends require the prior approval of the georgia department of banking and finance 
maryland law generally limits dividends by heritage to an amount equal to the excess of our capital surplus over payments that would be owed upon dissolution to stockholders whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the dividend  and to an amount that would not make us insolvent 
the office of thrift supervision has directed heritage to obtain the agency s approval before declaring or paying any cash dividend by submitting days notice 
we expect this requirement will apply to heritage until it is rescinded by the office of thrift supervision 
finally  pursuant to office of thrift supervision regulations  during the three year period following the conversion  we will not take any action to declare an extraordinary dividend to stockholders that would be treated by r ecipients as a tax free return of capital for federal income tax purposes

the company completed the public offering on november  it sold  shares of common stock for per share  and its employee stock ownership plan purchased  of those shares with the proceeds of a loan from the company 
the company also issued  shares in a stock exchange based on exchange ratio for each outstanding share of heritage financial g roup 
the company received net proceeds of million in the public offering  of which was contributed to the heritage bank and million of which was lent to the esop for its purchase of shares in the offering 
at december   the company had  outstanding shares 
its stock trades on the nasdaq global market under the symbol hbos 
the principal business of heritage is operating its wholly owned subsidiary  heritagebank 
on an unconsolidated basis  heritage has no significant assets  other than of the outstanding common stock of heritagebank  the liquid assets it acquired with the net proceeds it retained from the offering and the loan to the employee stock ownership plan and certain liquid assets  and it has no significant liabilities 
heritage uses staff and offices of heritagebank and pays heritagebank for these services 
if heritage expands or changes its business in the future  it may hire its own employees 
in the future  we may pursue other business activities  including mergers and acquisitions  investment alternatives and diversification of operations 
there are  however  no current understandings or agreements for these activities 
heritagebank was originally chartered in as a federal credit union  serving the marine corps logistic base in albany  georgia 
over the years  it evolved into a full service  multi branch community credit union in dougherty  lee  mitchell and worth counties in georgia 
it was converted from a federal credit union charter to a federal mutual savings bank in july the objective of that charter conversion was to better serve customers and the local community though the broader lending ability of a savings bank and to expand our customer base beyond the limited field of membership permitted for credit unions 
in february  heritagebank converted to stock form in a reorganization into a two tier mutual holding company structure  which was eliminated in the second step conversion 
on january   heritagebank converted to a georgia chartered stock savings bank  because that charter best suited our continued efforts to grow and expand our commercial business 
it now operates from locations in southern georgia and north central florida 
the principal business of heritagebank consists of attracting retail and commercial deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in permanent loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences  multi family residences and commercial property and a variety of consumer and commercial business loans 
revenues from this business are derived principally from interest on loans and securities and fee income 
heritagebank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms  which generally include savings accounts  money market deposit and term certificate accounts and checking accounts 
it solicits deposits in our market areas and  to a lesser extent  from brokered deposits 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting of savings and checking accounts  money market accounts  time deposits  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings 
our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  transaction fees  bank owned life insurance  and commissions from investment services 
n oninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing  advertising  professional fees and other costs 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
heritagebank is subject to extensive regulation by the georgia department of banking and finance and the fdic 
as the holding company of heritagebank  the company is subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision 
in july  this regulatory oversight will transfer to the board of governors of the federal reserve 
critical accounting policies we have established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by us represent critical accounting policies 
for more information on heritage s accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses in the loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
since its transition from a credit union  heritagebank has recorded income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by heritage in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review of the positions we have taken by taxing authorities could result in adjustments to our financial statements 
estimates of fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of heritage s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  goodwill  other real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned typically are determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value also are required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
heritage reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit

evolution of business strategy our current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized and profitable commercial and retail financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of our customers 
we strive to be the primary financial institution in the market areas we serve 
we offer a broad range of products and services while stressing personalized and efficient customer service and convenient access to these products and services 
we intend to continue to operate as a commercial and consumer lender 
we have structured operations around a branch system that is staffed with knowledgeable and well trained employees 
subject to capital requirements and our ability to grow in a reasonable and prudent manner  we may open or acquire additional branches as opportunities arise 
in addition to our branch system  we continue to expand electronic services for our customers 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a higher level of customer service 
expansion efforts 
a key element of our business strategy is increasing our presence and growing the heritage brand in the markets we currently serve and expanding our operations beyond our original southwest georgia market by entering new markets in other parts of southern georgia  north central florida and other adjacent communities that present attractive opportunities for expansion consistent with our capital availability 
this expansion of our market beyond southwest georgia began in  when we commenced operating a branch in ocala  florida 
we have pursued this expansion program through both prudent  disciplined internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
because many of the financial institutions in our market areas are experiencing financial difficulties  these opportunities have increased in recent months 
as those troubled banks have closed or curtailed their lending activities  shrink their assets or sold branches to improve their capital levels  we have experienced increased loan demand and branch acquisition opportunities  we have hired highly regarded and experienced lending officers and commercial bankers  and we have expanded into new market areas that are contiguous to our existing market areas 
these recent activities reflect our ability to take advantage of these expansion opportunities 
in early december  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of the tattnall bank in southeast georgia through an fdic assisted transaction 
in that acquisition of the tattnall bank with its two branch offices in reidsville and collins  georgia  we obtained million in loans and assumed million in deposits 
in addition  we purchased million in fixed assets 
this fdic assisted transaction did not involve a loss share agreement pursuant to which the fdic covers portions of the losses incurred or the assets acquired 
we did  however  receive a million purchase discount paid by the fdic 
as is typical in the acquisition of a failed financial institution  many of the loans acquired were non performing and had poor documentation  including a lack of current financial information on borrowers and of current evidence of collateral value 
in addition  these loans had an average term of years  mostly on longer amortization schedules and payments due less frequently than on a monthly basis 
these loans are carried on our books at fair value  based on an estimate of future cash flows  which we review and evaluate quarterly and  under gaap  is subject to a one year lookback to finalize our initial valuation 
because of the condition and terms of these loans  the actual amount recognized by us on these assets could differ materially from this fair value  and we also anticipate incurring foreclosure and collection expenses on certain of these loans over the next five years  which will increase our non interest expense 
therefore  we may incur losses on this acquired loan portfolio 
in  after completion of our final valuation of this acquisition  we recorded a bar gain purchase gain of approximately million 
in late december  we acquired a branch from atlantic coast bank in lake city  florida 
in that branch acquisition  we obtained million in performing loans and assumed million in deposits 
in addition  we purchased approximately  in fixed assets 
we paid a deposit premium of approximately  or for all deposits acquired 
on may   we acquired five branches from the park avenue bank  two in statesboro and one each in baxley  hazlehurst and adel  georgia 
this increased our footprint in southwest and southeast georgia 
in that acquisition  we acquired approximately million in loans and assumed million in deposits 
in addition  we purchased approximately million in fixed assets 
we paid a deposit premium of approximately million  or for all non certificate deposits acquired
