these companies are sometimes collectively referred to as the insurance group  and ihc and its subsidiaries including the insurance group are sometimes collectively referred to as the company 
ihc s health insurance products serve niche sectors of the commercial market through multiple classes of business and varied distribution channels 
medical stop loss is marketed to large employer groups that self insure their medical risks  in the company s average case size was covered lives 
the small group major medical product is purchased by employers with between two and covered lives 
with regard to those persons in the growing individual market  ihc s products offer major medical coverage for individuals and families and persons with short term medical needs  and limited medical and scheduled benefit plans through select distribution partners 
standard security life s limited medical product is primarily purchased by hourly workers and others who are generally not eligible for coverage under their employer s group medical plan 
the dental and vision products are marketed to large and small groups as well as individuals 
ihc is beginning to sell health and life products for the senior market with select distribution partners 
with respect to ihc s life and disability business  madison national life has historically sold almost all of this business through one distribution source specializing in serving school districts and municipalities 
while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning and decision making  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as the primary goal in all decisions as to whether or not to increase our retention in a core line  expand into new products  acquire an entity or a block of business  or otherwise change our business model 
management assessment of trends in healthcare and morbidity  with respect to medical stop loss  fully insured medical  disability and dbl  mortality rates with respect to life insurance  and changes in market conditions in general play a significant role in determining the rates charged  deductibles and attachment points quoted  and the percentage of business retained 
ihc also seeks transactions that permit it to leverage its vertically integrated organizational structure by generating fee income from production and administrative operating companies as well as risk income for its car riers and profit commissions 
management has always focused on managing costs of its operations and providing its insureds with the best cost containment tools available

the company had been working with a software developer on this project for a number of years in order to improve the company s administrative efficiency as it sought in prior years to quickly expand its premiums under management 
during testing of the software  it was determined that the system was not capable of administering the company s lines of business as is and it would take a substantial additional investment to implement 
as a result of our decision to reduce the speed of our expansion in this segment  the company determined not to continue to expend capital on this software

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company consolidated financial statements and this management discussion and analysis 
insurance premium revenue recognition and policy charges life traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  primarily term and whole life insurance products 
premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due 
annuities and interest sensitive life contracts  such as universal life and interest sensitive whole life  are contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed 
premiums from these policies are reported as funds on deposit 
policy charges consist of fees assessed against the policyholder for cost of insurance mortality risk  policy administration and early surrender 
these revenues are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
policies that do not subject the company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are considered investment contracts 
deposits received from such contracts are reported as other policyholder funds 
policy charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the policyholder account for maintenance  administration and surrender of the policy prior to contractually specified dates  and are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
health premiums for short duration medical insurance contracts are intended to cover expected claim costs resulting from insured events that occur during a fixed period of short duration 
the company has the ability to cancel the annual contract or to revise the premium rates at the beginning of each annual contract period to cover future insured events 
insurance premiums from annual health contracts are collected monthly and are recognized as revenue evenly as insurance protection is provided 
premiums related to long term and short term disability contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal  other fees  and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment function for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
loss reserves differ for short duration and long duration insurance policies  including annuities 
reserves are based on approved actuarial methods  but necessarily include assumptions about expenses  mortality  morbidity  lapse rates and future yield on related investments 
all of the company s short duration contracts are generated from its accident and health business  and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
life for traditional life insurance products  the company computes insurance reserves primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality  and withdrawals 
these methods are widely used in the life insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates that could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
policyholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products  such as universal life  interest sensitive life and annuities 
policyholder funds are comprised primarily of deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the policyholder less surrenders and withdrawals  mortality charges and administrative expenses 
interest credited interest credited to policyholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest sensitive life policies and investment policies 
amounts charged to operations including interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances are reported as insurance benefits  claims and reserves life and annuity 
credit rates for certain annuities and interest sensitive life policies are adjusted periodically by the company to reflect current market conditions  subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates 
health the company believes that its recorded insurance reserves are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate liability 
the company primarily uses its own loss development experience  but will also supplement that with data from its outside actuaries  reinsurers and industry loss experience as warranted 
to illustrate the impact that loss ratios have on the company s loss reserves and related expenses  each hypothetical change in the loss ratio for the health business ie  the ratio of insurance benefits  claims and settlement expenses to earned health premiums for the year ended december   would increase reserves in the case of a higher ratio or decrease reserves in the case of a lower ratio by approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
depending on the circumst ances surrounding a change in the loss ratio  other pre tax amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations could also be affected  such as amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense 
the company s health reserves by segment are as follows in thousands december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual accident and health and other december  claim policy total health reserves claims reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability individual accident and health and other medical stop loss all of the company s medical stop loss policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
the two primary assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity materi al effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is set using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years which deviated by  and net loss ratio points  respectively 
after the recorded reserve increase  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for the underwriting year at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected net loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims  and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
group disability the company s group disability segment is comprised of long term disability ltd and disability benefits law dbl 
the two primary assumptions on which group disability reserves are based are i morbidity levels  and ii recovery rates 
if morbidity levels increase  for example due to an epidemic or a recessionary environment  the company would increase reserves because there would be more new claims than expected 
in regard to the assumed recovery rate  if disabled lives recover more quickly than anticipated then the existing claims reserves would be reduced  if less quickly  the existing claims reserves would be increased 
advancements in medical treatments could affect future recovery  termination  and mortality rates 
with respect to ltd only  other assumptions are i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in offsets  iii advancements in medical treatments  and iv cost of living 
changes in market interest rates could change reserve assumptions since the payout period could be as long as years 
changes in offsets such as social security benefits  retirement plans and state disability plans also impact reserving 
as a result of the forgoing assumptions  it is possible that the historical trend may not be an accurate predictor of the future development of the block 
as with most long term insurance reserves that require judgment  the reserving process is subject to uncertainty and volatility and fluctuations may not be indicative of the claim development overall 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its primary assumptions would have a material effect 
individual accident and health and other this segment is a combination of closed lines of business as well as certain small existing lines 
while the assumptions used in setting reserves vary between these different lines of business  the assumptions would generally relate to the following i the rate of disability  ii the morbidity rates on specific diseases  and iii accident rates 
the reported reserves are based on management s best estimate for each line within this segment 
general uncertainties that surround all insurance reserving methodologies would apply 
however  since the company has so few policies of this type  volatility may occur due to the small number of claims 
deferred acquisition costs costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment type contracts are deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
these costs are principally broker fees  agent commissions  and the purchase prices of the acquired blocks of insurance policies and investment type contracts 
dac is amortized to expense and reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
all dac within a particular product type is amortized on the same basis using the following methods for traditional life insurance and other premium paying policies amortization of dac is charged to expense over the related premium revenue recognition period 
assumptions used in the amortization of dac are determined based upon the conditions as of the date of policy issue or assumption and are not generally revised during the life of the policy 
for long duration type contracts  such as annuities and universal life business  amortization of dac is charged to expense over the life of the underlying contracts based on the present value of the estimated gross profits egps expected to be realized 
egps consist of margins based on expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  and other revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its egps to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
if the company determines that the current assumptions underlying the egps are no longer the best estimate for the future due to changes in actual versus expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  or other revenues and expenses  the future egps are updated using the new assumptions and prospective unlocking occurs 
these updated egps are utilized for future amortization calc ulations 
the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted through a current charge or credit to the consolidated statement of operations 
internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts determined to result in a replacement contract that is substantially changed from the original contract  will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original contract  resulting in a release of the unamortized deferred acquisition costs  unearned revenue  and deferred sales inducements associated with the replaced contract 
investments the company has classified all of its investments as either available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations  using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operat ions 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices when available 
in some cases  we use quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets and or model derived valuations where inputs are observable in active markets 
when there are limited or inactive trading markets  we use industry standard pricing methodologies  including discounted cash flow models  whose inputs are based on management assumptions and available current market information 
further  we retain independent pricing vendors to assist in valuing certain instruments 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method 
the company reviews its investment securities regularly and determines whether other than temporary impairments have occurred 
the factors considered by management in its regular review include  but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the company intent to sell  or be required to sell  the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  subordinated credit support  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  current expected cash flows  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including the effect of changes in market interest rates 
for fixed maturities  if the company intends to sell a security  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the security s amortized cost basis  the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statement of operations 
if a decline in fair value of a debt security is judged by management to be other than temporary  and i the company does not intend to sell the security  and ii it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the security s amortized cost  the company assesses whether the present value of the cash flows to be collected from the security is less than its amortized cost basis 
to the exten t that the present value of the cash flows generated by a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis  a credit loss exists 
for any such security  the impairment is bifurcated into a the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss  and b the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statement of operations  establishing a new cost basis for the security 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
equity securities may experience other than temporary impairment in the future based on the prospects for full recovery in value in a reasonable period of time and the company s ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
if a decline in fair value is judged by management to be other than temporary  or management does not have the intent and ability to hold a security  a loss is recognized by a charge to total other than temporary impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the purpose of other than temporary impairment evaluations  preferred stocks with maturities are treated in a manner similar to debt securities 
declines in the creditworthiness of the issuer of debt securities with both debt and equity like features require the use of the equity model in analyzing the security for other than temporary impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill carrying amounts are evaluated for impairment  at least annually  at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to an operating segment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  we used an income approach  applying a discounted cash flow method which included a residual value 
based on historical experience  we make assumptions as to i expected future performance and future economic conditions  ii projected operating earnings  iii projected new and renewal business as well as profit margins on such business  and iv a discount rate that incorporated an appropriate risk level for the reporting unit 
any impairment of goodwill would be charged to expense 
no impairment charge for goodwill was required in or at december   the company wrote off million of goodwill in connection with an other than temporary impairment loss related to its then equity method investment in amic 
during  the company obtained a controlling interest in amic 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the item of this report for further information 
other intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing 
any impairment write down of other intangible assets would be charged to expense 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses include the write off of million of previously capitalized software 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the item of this report for further information regarding the impairment loss in no impairment charges for intangible assets were required in or at december   the company s market capitalization was less than its book value indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
as a result  the company assessed the factors contributing to the performance of ihc stock in the company does not believe that an impairment of goodwill exists at this time 
if we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
deferred income taxes the provision for deferred income taxes is based on the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to temporary differences between amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recognized for the portion of deferred tax assets that  in management judgment  is not likely to be realized 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has certain tax planning strategies that were used in determining that a valuation allowance was not necessary on its deferred taxes 
results of operations results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  information by business segment for the year ended december  and is as follows equity benefits  amortization selling  december  net income fee and claims of deferred general premiums investment from other and acquisition and in thousands earned income amic income reserves costs administrative total medical stop loss fully insured group disability  life  annuities and dbl individual life  annuities and other corporate sub total net realized investment gains other than temporary impairment losses interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations equity benefits  amortization selling  december  net income fee and claims of deferred general premiums investment from other and acquisition and in thousands earned income amic income reserves costs administrative total medical stop loss fully insured group disability  life  annuities and dbl individual life  annuities and other corporate sub total net realized investment losses other than temporary impairment losses interest expense loss from continuing operations before income tax benefits income tax benefits loss from continuing operations acquisition of amic on march   ihc acquired a controlling interest in amic as a result of the purchase of amic common stock in the open market 
in determining the bargain purchase gain with regard to the acquisition of the controlling interest in amic  ihc first recognized a gain of million as a result of re measuring its equity interest in amic to its fair value of million immediately before the acquisition based on the closing market price of amic common stock 
then  upon the acquisition of a controlling interest on march   the company consolidated the net assets of amic 
accordingly  the company determined the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from amic on such date 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the sum of i the fair value of the consideration paid  ii the fair value of ihc s equity investment prior to the acquisition  and iii the fair value of the noncontrolling interests in amic  resulting in a bargain purchase gain of million 
the total gain  amounting to million pre tax  is included in gain on bargain purchase of amic on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
this gain is a result of the quoted market price of amic being significantly less than the fair value of the net assets of amic 
this disparity is due to the low trading volume in amic shares  and a discount on the shares traded due to a lack of control by minority shareholders 
the fair value of the noncontrolling interests in amic was based on the closing market price of amic s common stock 
prior to obtaining control  ihc recorded its investment in amic using the equity method 
ihc recorded changes in its investment in amic in the equity income from amic line in the consolidated statements of operations 
upon achieving control  on march   amic s income and expense amounts became consolidated with ihc s results 
accordingly  the individual line items on the consolidated statement of operations for reflect approximately ten months of the operations of amic with no corresponding amounts for premiums earned premiums earned in include million of earned premiums related to the consolidation of amic with no comparable amounts in excluding these amounts  earned premiums in decreased by million compared to the decrease is primarily due to i a million decrease in the medical stop loss segment primarily due to reduced production from the termination of certain non owned managing general underwriters and market conditions  and ii a million decrease in the group disability  life  annuities and dbl segment primarily resulting from a million decrease in group term life business  a million net decrease in point of service and other lines of this segment  offset by an increase of million in the ltd line due to new business written  partially offset by iii a million increase in premiums earned in the fully insured health segment comprised primarily of a million increase in dental premiums and a million increase in small group premiums as a result of both increased production and increased retention  and a million net increase in other lines of this segment due to increased production  principally in the limited medical and vision lines  offset by a million decrease in student accident premiums as a result of the cancellation of a producer of this product  and iv a 
million increase in premiums earned in the individual life  annuities and other segment 
net investment income total net investment income decreased million 
the overall annualized investment yields were and approximately and  on a tax advantaged basis for and  respectively 
the annualized investment yields on bonds  equities and short term investments were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income is due to a decrease in yields and the shorter duration of our portfolio 
ihc has approximately million in highly rated shorter duration securities earning on average 
a portfolio that is shorter in duration enables us  if we deem prudent  the flexibility to reinvest in higher yielding longer term securities in an increasing interest rate environment 
net realized investment gains and other than temporary impairment losses  net net realized investment gains decreased million in these amounts include gains and losses from sales of fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale  trading securities and other investments 
decisions to sell securities are based on management ongoing evaluation of investment opportunities and economic and market conditions  thus creating fluctuations in gains and losses from period to period 
net realized investment gains in were reduced by an additional loss of million resulting from discussions in the fourth quarter of with the trustee in bankruptcy pertaining to the resolution of claims related to the non affiliate broker dealer that managed the trading accounts of the company in the million pre tax loss consisted of i the reversal of 
million of anticipated sipc recoveries initially recorded by a subsidiary of ihc  ii the reversal of 
million of anticipated sipc recoveries initially recorded by amic  and iii an additional million of withdrawals by ihc and amic deemed subject to return 
a settlement agreement was entered into with the trustee in the first quarter of and payment by the company is expected to be made on or before july   see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the item of this report for more information about net realized investment gains and losses 
other than temporary impairment losses in consist of million of credit losses resulting from expected cash flows of debt securities that are less than the debt securities amortized cost and 
million resulting from the company s intent to sell certain municipal debt securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
other than temporary impairment losses in consist of million related to an other than temporary impairment of the company s investment in amic due to the length of time  and the magnitude of the amount by which the quoted market price of amic was below ihc s carrying value and 
million resulting from the company s intent to sell certain securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases

the company had been working with a software developer on this project for a number of years in order to improve the company s administrative efficiency as it sought in prior years to quickly expand its premiums under management 
the software was delivered to the company in the fourth quarter of during testing of the software  it was determined that the system was not capable of administering the company s lines of business as is and it would take a substantial additional investment to implement 
as the company is not willing to incur the additional investment to make the software functional  the carrying value was fully written off 
income taxes income tax expense increased million to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  from a tax benefit of million for the year ended the effective tax rate was for the year ended compared to for the year ended in  the effective tax rate is the result of i tax expense on pre tax income generated by the life companies  ii tax benefits derived from tax exempt interest and dividend received deductions as a result of the company investments in both state and political subdivisions and preferred securities  and iii tax benefits on pre tax losses from the non life businesses which have higher effective rates due to state tax benefits

liquidity insurance group the insurance group normally provides cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed maturities  and iii earnings on investments 
such cash flow is partially used to fund liabilities for insurance policy benefits 
these liabilities represent long term and short term obligations 
corporate corporate derives its funds principally from i dividends from the insurance group  ii management fees from its subsidiaries  and iii investment income from corporate liquidity 
regulatory constraints historically have not affected the company consolidated liquidity  although state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by the insurance group 
the insurance group declared and paid  and  of dividends to corporate in and  respectively 
no dividends were declared or paid by the insurance group to corporate in corporate utilizes cash primarily for the payment of general overhead expenses  common stock dividends  common stock repurchases and debt repayment 
cash flows as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million 
net cash used by operating activities of discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million 
the company has million of insurance reserves that it expects to ultimately pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could utilize the cash received from maturities and repayments of its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with the company insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows 
for the year ended december   cash received from the maturities and other repayments of fixed maturities was million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily the result of net cash received from other investments and policy block acquisitions 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and primarily includes dividends paid  the repurchases of common stock and repayment of debt among other items 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including working capital requirements and capital investments 
balance sheet total investments  net of amounts due from brokers  increased million to million during the year ended december  from million at december  largely due to million of investments acquired through the acquisition of amic and million in pre tax unrealized gains on available for sale securities 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  all of such reinsurance receivables are either due from highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  in  the company entered into an assumption reinsurance agreement related to its discontinued credit business which resulted in a decrease in unearned premium reserves and a corresponding decrease in amounts due from reinsurers 
other assets increased million primarily due intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of amic and other subsidiaries  partially offset by a decrease in tax assets 
asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations  which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
although the company gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled million at december   approximately of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average aa 
the company marks all of its available for sale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
these investments tend to carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately or million of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in non investment grade fixed maturities primarily mortgage securities investments in such securities have different risks than investmen t grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the increase in non investment grade securities is primarily due to the downgrades in credit ratings of certain alt a mortgage securities 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturity investments at december  at december   the company had  invested in whole loan cmos backed by alt a mortgages 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in the company s mortgage security portfolio has no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the unrealized losses for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads from preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets since the time of their acquisition 
some of these financial institutions have exposure to sub prime mortgages 
approximately of fixed maturities  primarily municipal obligations  in our investment portfolio are insured by financial guaranty insurance companies 
the purpose of this insurance is to increase the credit quality of the fixed maturities and their credit ratings 
if the obligations of these financial guarantors ceased to be valuable  either through a credit rating downgrade or default  these debt securities would likely receive lower credit ratings by the rating agencies that would reflect the creditworthiness of the various obligors as if the fixed maturities were uninsured 
the following table summarizes the credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio as rated  and as rated if the fixed maturities were uninsured  at december  as rated bond ratings as rated if uninsured aaa aa a bbb total investment grade bb or lower total fixed maturities changes in interest rates  credit spreads  and investment quality ratings may cause the market value of the company s investments to fluctuate 
the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will have to sell debt securities in unrealized loss positions that are not other than temporarily impaired before recovery 
in the event that the company s liquidity needs require the sale of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate  liquidity or credit spread environments  the company may realize investment losses 
the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments  as discussed in note g vi of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
for the years ended december  and the company recorded losses of million and 
million  respectively  for other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of securities with fair values less than of their amortized cost at december  by the length of time the fair values of those securities were below of their amortized cost in thousands greater than greater than months  months  less than less than less than greater than months months months months total fixed maturities equity securities total the unrealized losses on all available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  in  the company experienced million of unrealized gains which  net of deferred taxes million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs million  increased stockholders equity by million reflecting net unrealized gains of 
million at december  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities  further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry  a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace  a continuation or wors ening of the current economic recession  or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as other than temporary in future periods and the company may incur additional write downs 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
all goodwill carrying amounts are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is equivalent to an operating segment 
goodwill was allocated to each reporting unit or operating segment at the time of acquisition 
at december   total goodwill was million  of which million was attributable to the fully insured health segment and million to the medical stop loss segment 
based upon the goodwill impairment testing performed at december   the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charge was required 
fair value exceeded carrying value by at least in both the fully insured health and the medical stop loss segments 
in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  we used an income approach  applying a discounted cash flow method which included a residual value 
based on historical experience  we made assumptions as to i expected future performance and future economic conditions  ii projected operating earnings  iii projected new and renewal business as well as profit margins on such business  and iv a discount rate that incorporated an appropriate risk level for the reporting unit 
management uses a significant amount of judgment in estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the key assumptions underlying the fair value process are subject to uncertainty and change 
the following represent some of the potential risks that could impact these assumptions and the related expected future cash flows i increased competition  ii an adverse change in the insurance industry and overall business climate  iii changes in state and federal regulations  iv rating agency downgrades of our insurance companies  and v a sustained and significant decrease in our share price and market capitalization 
as a result of the global economic crisis that began in  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
due to this significant decline  our market capitalization as of december  was significantly below the sum of our reporting units fair values 
if we experien ce a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows  or other indicators of impairment exist  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results 
health reserves the following table summarizes the prior year net favorable amount incurred in according to the year to which it relates  together with the opening reserve balance net of reinsurance recoverable to which it relates in thousands reserves at prior year amount january  incurred in total reserves and prior total the following sections describe  for each segment  the unfavorable favorable development experienced in  together with the key assumptions and changes therein affecting the reserve estimates 
medical stop loss the company experienced net unfavorable development of million in the medical stop loss segment 
the deficiency was the result of on going analysis of recent loss development trends primarily attributable to the increased frequency of claims and the severity of primary claims 
group disability the group disability segment had a favorable development of million 
this amount consists of a favorable development of million on the reserves due to dbl million and ltd million and a net unfavorable development of 
million for all other years primarily due to ltd 
due to the long term nature of ltd  in establishing loss reserves the company must make estimates for case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves ibnr  and reserves for loss adjustment expenses lae 
case reserves generally equal the actuarial present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the ibnr reserve is established based upon historical trends of existing incurred claims that were reported after the balance sheet date 
the lae reserve is calculated based on an actuarial expense study 
since the ltd block of policies is relatively small  with the potential for very large claims on individual policies  results can vary from year to year 
if a small number of claimants with large claim reserves were to recover or several very large claims were incurred  the results could distort the company s r eserve estimates from year to year 
however  there were no individual factors in that caused the favorable development in ltd 
with respect to dbl  reserves for the most recent quarter of earned premium are established using a net loss ratio methodology 
the net loss ratio is determined by applying the completed prior four quarters of historical net loss ratios to the last quarter of earned premium 
reserves associated with the premium earned prior to the last quarter are established using a completion factor methodology 
the completion factors are developed using the historical payment patterns for dbl 
the favorable development in the dbl line is due to lower than expected claims 
there were normal fluctuations to the company experience factor 
the ibnr factors were updated to reflect the current experience 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to individual accident and health and other the individual accident and health and other segment had unfavorable development of 
million 
the company experienced 
million unfavorable variance related to reserves on our blanket accident and sickness product that is sold to volunteer fire districts  primarily due to the severity of a few claims related to that treaty year 
capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in november  december and march  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively  through pooled trust preferred issuances by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in august  the outstanding line of credit was cancelled and converted into an amortizing term loan 
at december  the outstanding balance of the term loan was million

ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations  including liabilities for insurance reserves  funds on deposit  debt and operating lease obligations 
however  ihc does not believe that its cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon ihc s future needs 
although some outflows are fixed  others depend on future events 
the chart below reflects the maturity distribution of ihc s contractual obligations at december  in thousands junior funds subordinated interest insurance on debt debt on debt leases reserves deposit total and thereafter totals outlook the company remained highly liquid in with a shorter duration portfolio 
as a result  the yields on our investment portfolio were  and continue to remain  lower than in prior years and investment income may continue to be depressed for the balance of the year 
ihc has approximately million in highly rated shorter maturity securities earning on average  our portfolio as a whole is rated  on average  aa 
the low duration of our portfolio enables us  if we deem prudent  the flexibility to reinvest in much higher yielding longer term securities  which would significantly increase investment income 
a low duration portfolio such as ours also mitigates the adverse impact of potential inflation 
ihc will continue to monitor the financial markets and invest accordingly 
in march  ihc acquired control of amic through the purchase of additional shares of amic common stock in the open market  at december   ihc owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of amic 
the acquisition furthers our goal of creating efficiencies by integrating the back office operations of our mgus and marketing companies 
subsequent to year end  through march   the company has acquired an additional  shares of amic common stock  increasing its ownership to 
the company will consider acquiring additional shares of amic stock in the market and or in private transactions as opportunities arise 
for  we will continue to emphasize preparing for health care reform by proactively adjusting our mix of fully insured health products and distribution strategies to take advantage of changing market demands  while continuing to increase the efficiency of our fully insured administrative companies 
increasing the efficiency of our medical stop loss operations and seeking to acquire additional medical stop loss business to increase our premiums in a controlled underwriting environment 
we have determined that the results of mgus in which we have ownership generally outperform those of ones we do not own by a substantial margin  which is why we have reduced our block to focus primarily on business written by owned mgus 
closely monitoring the experience in our group disability  life annuities and dbl business 
we will continue to focus on our strategic objectives  including expanding our distribution network 
however  the success of a portion of our fully insured health business may be affected by the passage of the patient protection and affordable care and education reconciliation act of signed by president obama in march  and its subsequent interpretations by state and federal regulators and its possible revision by the newly elected congress 
the national association of insurance commissioners has now issued its proposed regulations 
the regulations proposed to date including those mandating minimum loss ratios seem to have validated our strategy of pursuing niche lines of business across many states utilizing multiple carriers 
we have begun a comprehensive review of all the options for ihc and we are continuing a thorough evaluation of our options for those health insurance products that may be affected 
although the law will generally require insurers to operate with a lower expense structure for major medical plans in the small employer and individual markets  the law appears to make exceptions for carriers  such as ours  that have a minimal presence in any one state 
non essential lines of business are not impacted by health care reform 
our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing  our underwriting and the accuracy of our reserving methodology  returns on our invested assets and our ability to manage expenses 
therefore  factors affecting these items  including unemployment and global financial markets  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain an investment portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  change in interest rates basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline corporate securities cmo s us government obligation agency mbs gse state political subdivision total estimated fair value estimated change in value the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substantially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures
