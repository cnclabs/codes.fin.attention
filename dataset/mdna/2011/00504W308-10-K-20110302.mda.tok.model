executive level overview active power is headquartered in austin  texas  where we manufacture our patented flywheel uninterruptible power supply ups systems and continuous power and infrastructure solutions 
these solutions ensure continuity for business and it operations for enterprises  data center operations and it service providers in the event of power disturbances 
our products and solutions are designed to deliver continuous clean power during power disturbances and outages  voltage sags and surges and provide ride through power in the event of utility failure supporting operations until utility power is restored or a longer term alternative power source  such as a diesel generator is started 
we believe that our products offer an advantage over those of our competitors in the areas of space and energy efficiency  total cost of ownership  system reliability  modular design and the economically green benefits of our solutions 
as of december   we have shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts of power to customers in countries around the world 
we are headquartered in austin  texas  with international offices in the united kingdom  germany  china and japan 
our patented flywheel based ups systems store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods  until either utility power is restored or a backup electric generator starts and takes over generating longer term power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we believe our flywheel products provide many competitive advantages over conventional battery based ups systems  including substantial space savings  higher power densities  green energy storage  and higher power efficiencies up to 
this high energy efficiency reduces operating costs and provides customers a lower total cost of ownership 
we offer our flywheel products with load capabilities from kva to  kva 
we typically target higher power applications of kva and above  largely because the majority of customers in this market segment have backup generators 
our flywheel based ups systems are marketed under the brand name cleansource 
we also sell continuous power systems cps  which incorporate our ups products with switchgear and a generator to provide complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance 
where the cps is sold in a containerized package  it is marketed under the brand name powerhousetm 
powerhouse can be deployed in either a foot or foot long iso container depending upon the customer s power load requirements 
these systems are specifically designed to handle the demands of high tech facilities requiring the highest power integrity available while maximizing up time  useable floor space and operational efficiency 
designed to offer a highly flexible architecture to a customer s constantly changing environment  our powerhouse systems are offered in four standard modular power configurations  enabling sizing for infrastructure on demand 
these systems are highly differentiated as they offer flexibility in placement  space savings  fast deployment time after receipt of order  high energy efficiency  and prompt capital deployment to meet current demands 
they also deliver significant value to customers as the entire system is integrated and tested prior to delivery for a repeatable simple solution 
we also sell cps solutions to customers in a non containerized format  typically deploying such solutions inside buildings 
leveraging our expertise in containerization and power distribution  in we began to manufacture continuous infrastructure solutions  designed to specification for select business partners 
these solutions serve as the infrastructure for modular data centers  which are self contained fully functional data centers 
modular data centers may be rapidly deployed with other modular data centers as a cost effective alternative to traditional raised floor data centers 
active power designs and delivers the exterior shell and a fully fitted out interior including electrical  cooling  monitoring  and other elements ready for the customer to add their it racks and servers 
after the customer adds their it equipment to our continuous infrastructure solution  the customer has a function al data center 
continuous infrastructure solutions represented of revenue 
we expect revenue to grow in coming years from current and future customers as modular data center infrastructure continues to gain acceptance in the market 

table of contents our total revenue in increased by million  or  from  primarily driven by an increase in the global demand for new data center construction and increased market acceptance of our products and solutions 
sales of our cps systems and containerized infrastructure solution products increased by approximately million  or  compared to as a number of global customers made repeated purchases of our cps products  reflecting growing acceptance of  and validation of the improved performance characteristics of our cps solutions and containerized infrastructure solution products 
our ups product revenues also increased by million  or  from reflecting better global demand and acceptance of our battery free ups systems 
we sell our products to a wide array of commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets  including data centers  manufacturing  technology  broadcast and communications  financial  utilities  healthcare  government and airports 
we have expanded our global sales channels and direct sales force  selling in major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america  europe and asia 
we sell our products through the following distribution methods sales made directly by active power  manufacturer s representatives  distributors  oem partners  and strategic it partners 
table of contents our revenue derived from north america was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in europe was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in asia was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we achieved growth in all of our primary markets during our largest revenue growth occurred in the north america market  where our revenues increased by million or over our largest ups customers and a majority of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution product customers are located in north america 
after a disappointing performance in  our business in europe increased by million or as our efforts to build our sales organization took effect 
our revenues in asia increased by million or from as we opened a sales office in china and continued to build our sales organization in this region 
we believe total revenue will continue to grow in from all of our products and as we continue to focus on selling more complete systems rather than just products 
in particular  we expect continuing market acceptance of containerized solutions to drive higher sales of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution products globally 
we also believe that the global growth in data center demand will also lead to higher sales of our ups products 
we are specifically targeting those customers with large it and power needs who have the ability to make frequent and large ups purchases as their global operations expand 
our increase in revenue in helped drive further improvement in our gross profit  and for the fifth consecutive year we have reported improved gross margins 
our margins still fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending on the product mix of our revenues and were as high as during our third quarter of on an annual basis the gross profit margin increased to from in and compares favorably to the we had in the increased volume allows for more efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity  and this combined with higher pricing drove the improvement in margins 
our direct sales typically generate higher margins for us than sales that are made through our oem or distribution channels which is one of the reasons we continue to expand our direct sales capabilities 
nonetheless  our partners provide a significant contribution to our distribution strategy as they offer the potential to leverage their customer relationships to help bring sales volume to our operations 
our gross margin in the fourth quarter of was 
this was an improvement from the we recorded in the fourth quarter of due not only to the higher flywheel volumes  but also due to improved margins on our powerhouse products compared to  as we improve the efficiency and profitability of this product family 
our operating losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating losses include non cash stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million in  and respectively 
in we were able to decrease our operating losses by or million  compared to this reduction in losses is primarily due to the gross margin improvements that were driven by the higher revenue levels and by our efforts to control operating expenses 
our operating costs increased by compared to  primarily due to higher sales compensation and performance based compensation expenses despite a increase in revenues 
for the first time in our year history we were able to achieve quarterly operating profitability during the third and fourth quarters of as our revenue levels increased to a level sufficient to achieve this milestone 
the improved operating results and lower losses have also resulted in a decrease in the net cash used in operating activities 
in  for the first time in our history we generated positive cash flows from operations of million 
this compares to net cash used in operating activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the larger sales price of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure orders can cause large quarterly fluctuations in our inventory  receivables and payables balances  depending on the number of such orders in progress at any point in time 
this can cause material fluctuations in the level of working capital we require 
if the number of such orders increases rapidly or any of these orders have payment terms that are less favorable  we may need access to more liquidity to fund the growth of our business and to fulfill these orders 
we increased our bank revolving line of credit in to provide a source of funding for this scenario  and now have up to million of credit available to help fund our growth and manage our working capital requirements 
we have a history of annual operating losses and have not yet reached sustained operating profitability on an annual basis 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our powerhouse and continuous infrastructure solutions  combined with our focus on direct sales to customers  will help us to further increase our revenues and reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
we will need to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
our total cash and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  the increase in was primarily due to a sale of equity in that raised approximately million 
due to the impro vements in our operations in the second half of  as well as our fundraising in february and the new bank credit facilities we put in place in august  we believe that our cash and investments and available liquidity are sufficient to meet our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing econo mic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment for substantially all products sold directly to customers and through distributors because title and risk of loss pass on delivery to the common carrier 
our customers and distributors do not have the right to return products 
if title and risk of loss pass at some other point in time  we recognize such revenue for our customers when the product is delivered to the customer and title and risk of loss has passed 

table of contents we recognize installation and service and maintenance revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements emas over the life of the contracts using the straight line method  which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on certain rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straight line method 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
multiple element arrangements meas 
arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables 
our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of our cleansource ups or powerhouse products  combined with one or more of the following products design services  project management  commissioning and installation services  spare parts or consumables  and ema s 
delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide 
certain services related to design and consulting may occur prior to delivery of product and commissioning and installation typically take place within months of product delivery  depending upon customer requirements 
emas  consumables  and repair  mainten ance or consulting services generally are delivered over a period of one to five years 
in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of future products and services 
when arrangements outside of the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 
when arrangements include an ema  we recognize revenue related to the ema at the s tated contractual price on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement 
any taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenue producing transactions with customers are shown in our consolidated statement of operations on a net basis  that is excluded from our reported revenues stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our ups products and our cps infrastructure solutions 

table of contents the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
our product revenue was derived from the following sources in thousands change from prior year percent change product revenue ups product revenue continuous power systems data center infrastructure solutions total product revenue the majority of our product revenue growth in came from the sale of our cps and infrastructure solutions 
we were able to significantly increase volume for these products through our it channel partners and also with our direct sales organization  particularly in the north america market 
we have been able to capitalize on an emerging trend of modularized data center solutions  where our cps systems are able to offer higher power density and lower operating costs to provide a complimentary power and infrastructure solution for it companies when they sell such modularized products 
we introduced the containerized data center infrastructure solutions during as a way to provide complimentary products for  and to help in sale of our powerhouse products into the modular data center market 
we have also been successful at selling our powerhouse product directly to military  utility and data center customers during our efforts to grow cps and infrastructure solution sales reflects our strategy of focusing on selling total solutions and not just ups products to our customers 
this strategy has also led to a decrease in the growth in ups products compared to our other product categories 
in we sold flywheel product units  a increase from the units sold in  reflecting the higher volume of ups and cps products 
the average selling price per flywheel unit increased to  in compared to approximately  in  due to the higher proportion of wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
we typically generate higher prices and profit margins from our direct sales compared to sales made through our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
as our business evolves from selling stand alone ups systems to delivering complete powerhouse and continuous infrastructure solutions  a metric such as the number of flywheels sold and average selling price per flywheel unit becomes less indicative of our overall company performance 
our cps and infrastructure products tend to be larger in value and from a smaller number of customers compared to sales of our ups products 
this smaller number of customers with greater transaction value can contribute to large quarterly fluctuations in revenue from each product family  due to the timing of orders and shipments in any particular accounting period 
individual cps sales have been as high as million in  as we have delivered multiple cps products to single customers and our single largest order for continuous infrastructure products was over million in a small number of transactions can therefore lead to significant revenue  but cause greater volatility in our quarterly results and increase liquidity risk for us as we continue to refine and improve the payment terms of these opportunities as part of our working capital management 
product sales from our oem channels represented of our total revenue for compared to in and are primarily from the sale of ups systems 
the decrease in the percentage of total revenues derived from our oem channels occurred despite an actual increase in sales by our oem partners  as our it channel and direct sales businesses grew at much faster rates 
sales of our ups products are a much smaller part of our oem partner s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as the oem partner focuses on its core business 
product revenue from our oem channels did increase by in over  after declining by in compared to  reflecting improved performance from our oem partner 
we do believe that sales from this channel will continue to increase as general business conditions improve and due to an increased commitment to marketing by our oem partners to promote our ups products 
caterpillar remains our largest oem customer but is no longer our largest single customer 

table of contents product sales from our it channel partners represented of our product revenues for compared to of product revenues in this growth reflects the increased sales of cps and infrastructure solutions during by our it channel partners for their end customers 
north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for in total  our north america sales increased by in compared to  reflecting the overall growth in the market for our products in total and in particular for our data center infrastructure solutions and the improvement in overall market conditions within the us data center market 
sales of active power branded products through our direct and manufacturer s representative channels were of our total revenue for  compared to for as direct sales typically have higher profit margins than sales through our oem and it channels  we will continue to focus on building our direct sales channel to increase revenue and improve profit margins and to decrease our dependency upon any particular channel partner 
we believe sales of our active power branded products in markets that were not covered by our oems will continue to increase over time and will continue to become a larger percentage of our total revenue 
we also sell products directly to customers in asia and europe and we have a network of international distributors in other territories to sell our products 
in these markets  customers are more likely to purchase a total power solution such as powerhouse from us rather than a stand alone ups system 
this usually results in a longer selling cycle and makes quarterly results from these regions more inconsistent and dependent upon a smaller number of larger value transactions 
thus the amount of revenue from our international markets can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  but continue to increase when evaluated on an annual basis 
our sales in europe increased by in to million as we continue to expand our sales force and operations in germany and the uk in particular 
our sales in asia increased by in to million highlighted by stronger powerhouse sales in china 
in august we opened our first sales office in china as part of our effort to add sales and service capabilities to this market 
china represents the second largest ups market in the world and has the potential to become a substantial market for our products 
there is usually a gap between adding sales and service capability and generating meaningful revenue from a new territory 
as a result  we would expect that the investments that we have made during and in europe and asia will generate higher revenues from these regions in we continue to invest in sales  service and marketing capabilities in each of these regions as well as building brand awareness for our company and products globally 
our products perform well in harsh environments where power quality or reliability is particularly poor  which makes them a good fit for countries with a poor power infrastructure or in harsh manufacturing or process environments  or situations where reliability is paramount  such as mission critical business applications  particularly data center applications 
therefore we have traditionally focused our direct sales efforts on these types of customer situations 
service and other revenue service and other revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from both traditional after market service work and from customer specific system engineering 
this includes revenue from design  installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel and revenues or fees received upon contract deferment or cancellation 
revenue from extended maintenance contracts with our customers is also included in this revenue category 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change 
table of contents service and other revenue increased by for  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher levels of service and contract work from direct product sales and from professional fees associated with powerhouse and other continuous power system sales 
for these customers we provide a full power solution  including site preparation  installation of an entire power solution and provision of all products required to provide a turnkey product to the end user often including maintenance services 
we also had increased service revenues from maintenance contracts and repair related activities as our increasing install base of ups customers provides greater opportunities to generate such revenues 
where we make sales through our oem channel  it is typical for the oem to provide these types of services to their end use r customers so these revenue sources do not exist on our oem sales 
we anticipate that service and other revenue will continue to grow with product revenue  particularly as our powerhouse system revenue grows  and as our installed base of ups product expands  because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products  ancillary equipment that is sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations  including costs from having underutilized facilities  depreciation of our manufacturing property and equipment  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase in cost of product revenue was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in  and the impact of our continuous cost reduction efforts 
cost of product revenue also included  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was in  as compared to for this decrease in cost as a percentage of revenue compared to is due primarily to increased sales volumes  which resulted in more efficient utilization of our manufacturing facility and a lower level of unabsorbed overhead costs 
we continue to operate a manufacturing facility that has a manufacturing and testing capacity significantly greater than our current product revenue levels 
we continue to work on reducing ou r product costs through design enhancements and modifications  and vendor management programs and increasing our sales volume to absorb these expenses 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
this has been partially offset by the impact of increased sales of our cps  such as powerhouse and our infrastructure solutions 
our margins on powerhouse and infrastructure solutions sales are lower compared to the margins realized on our ups sales because we realize lower margins on the third party equipment that we purchase and include in our containerized product offerings 
we do not yet have a consistent volume of quarterly business from these new product offerings that would enable us to realize benefits from economies of scale  standardization of design  planning and purchasing  which we believe will lead to higher margins in the future for these products 
however  we continue to implement our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we believe that as our direct sales and our total revenues continue to increase  our product margins will continue to improve 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  without impacting quality levels  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
during these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue in spite of the pressures of higher raw material and commodity price increases 
we have also been able to utilize manufacturing personnel in the manufacture of our powerhouse and infrastructure solution products  which has further improved the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
for we anticipate further cost reductions from these ongoing programs 

table of contents cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts  as well as labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers and the costs of third party contractors used in completion of some of our professional services 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the cost of service and other revenue increased by in while our service and other revenues increased by 
as a percentage of service and other revenues  our costs were of revenue in  compared to in this increase reflects higher costs relative to the increase in service and other revenues as we continue to expand our service team to broaden the geographic regions where we have service capability as our total business grows 
operationally we are challenged to manage the growth of our service organization congruent with the growth in total revenues so that we can meet customer requirements without growing our service organization cost structure too rapidly 
the utilization of our service personnel will also be affected by the number of powerhouse and infrastructure solution products implemented in a particular period and in periods where we have a low number of installation projects  our costs as a percentage of revenue would be expected to increase 
a large portion of the costs involved in operating our service organization are fixed in nature and we incur approximately  to  in unabsorbed overhead each quarter 
we continue to work on reducing our service overhead through better utilization of our service employees and cost control measures 
this infrastructure also means that we can leverage this investment and grow our service capabilities substantially by adding direct technical labor only as required 
gross profit the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our gross profit in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase in our gross profit for was primarily driven by the increase in total revenues  higher average selling prices for all of our products  and better utilization of our manufacturing capacity  which resulted in lower unabsorbed overhead costs 
the introduction and higher sales of new products such as the data center infrastructure solutions also generate higher absolute profits than sales of ups systems only because of the higher transaction values 
our ability to continue to improve our gross profit will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to reduce material costs  improve our sales channel mix in favor of direct sales versus oem  increase sales of higher margin products such as our ups products  increase product prices and increasing our total revenues to a level that will allow us to improve th e utilization of our manufacturing and service operations 

table of contents research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs for employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change overall our research and development expenses were approximately  or  lower in compared to our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology  as well as refinements and enhancements to the standardization of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution products 
during a number of our engineering employees also worked directly on specific customer projects for customization and enhancement of modular products  and  of research and development expenses were charged to cost of product revenues to reflect the time and expense incurred in generating such revenues 
absent this  our research and development costs would have decreased by  or 
this decrease in spending compared to reflects lower project rela ted development costs this year as well as lower headcount costs 
the prior year expenses also included higher prototype and development costs from paralleling our megawatt class ups products 
research and development expenses included approximately  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we believe research and development expenses will increase in as we increase development and prototype efforts on our next generation ups product during selling and marketing selling and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation  including variable sales compensation  and related costs  for sales and marketing personnel  and related travel  selling and marketing expenses  compensation paid to resellers and agents  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs and the cost of our foreign sales operations 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change selling and marketing costs were approximately million  or  higher in compared to the increase from primarily reflects higher variable sales compensation  including payments made to third party representatives  and performance based compensation as a result of higher revenue and improving results 
the increase also reflects increased headcount as we focus on building and improving the active power brand and expanding our sales organization  particularly in europe and asia  to support our direct selling and channel sales activities 
we added specific sales resources to support each of our oem and it sales channels during  which we believe contributed to the improved performance from each of these channels in selling and marketing expenses also include approximately  and  of st ock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate that our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as our revenues grow  due to higher variable compensation expense  and as we continue to invest in marketing to grow our global brand awareness 
general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for board  executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  and taxes  including sales  property and franchise taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands 
table of contents year annual amount change from prior year percent change general and administrative expenses for increased approximately  or  compared to this increase primarily reflects higher performance based compensation expenses incurred as our overall financial results have improved  which were partially offset by lower professional and consulting services fees in general and administrative expenses included approximately  and  in stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate that the level of general and administrative expenses in should remain at similar levels to those in interest income expense the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest expense income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in net interest expense in primarily reflects lower interest income earned on lower interest rates  as well as a lower level of average cash invested compared to we also incurred higher interest expense as we had a larger average outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility in we negotiated a new million revolving credit facility with our bank in august that incurs a minimum monthly interest charge that also resulted in higher interest expense 
our average cash and investments balance over has increased by million  or  compared to the average balance over other expense  net net other expense in the years ended and reflects foreign exchange gains losses on a bank account held in foreign currencies by our subsidiary companies 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carry forwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carry forward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities 
however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carry forwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
although product revenues decreased overall from  revenues attributable to powerhouse  a new revenue source in  were million 
we also saw a million increase in sales of our kva product line 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of our other product lines  including our kva product line and our megawatt class product line  which decreased by million and million  respectively  from the decrease in product revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in product sales from our oem channels  where ups sales decreased by  or million  compared to  which was offset by the increase in powerhouse revenues 
in  we sold flywheel product units  a decrease over the units that we sold in due primarily to the decrease in oem product volume 
however  the average sales price per flywheel increased slightly to approximately  in from approximately  in  due largely to the higher proportion of wheels sold through our direct sales channels 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
the decrease in wheels sold was greater than the overall decline in revenue in  with the difference attributable to sales of our cps 

table of contents north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for this was due in part to the success with some of our it channel partners  including sun and hewlett packard  of our powerhouse product that we introduced into the north american market during we continued to expand the sales territories where we sell our active power branded products in as we increased our sales distribution capabilities  particularly in europe and asia 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and germany 
although we saw sales decreases in europe and asia  we were encouraged as our second half performance in europe increased by over the first half of the year 
sales to caterpillar represented of our product revenue in  as compared to of our product revenue in caterpillar remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
however  our revenue from caterpillar decreased by in and in the fourth quarter of caterpillar was of our quarterly revenue 
some of this decrease is attributable to the timing of larger orders from caterpillar for its customers 
we believe that this channel has been negatively influenced by external economic conditions that have caused its customers to delay product purchase decisions due to uncertainty or lack of liquidity 
sales of our ups products are also a much smaller part of caterpillar s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as cat erpillar focuses on its core business 
service and other revenue service and other revenue increased in although our larger installed base of customers that purchased products directly from us resulted in a higher level of customers with recurring maintenance contract agreements  our revenues from project installation and commissioning decreased as compared to due to a smaller number of large projects in however  in the fourth quarter of  service and other revenue increased from the prior quarter  which was primarily attributable to the higher level of project related services in connection with increased sales and installation of our powerhouse product and related services 
our service and other revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
in we recorded million of fees related to contract cancellation by one customer but we had no cancellations during we anticipate that service and other revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
in addition  because our oem partners typically provide these services to their end user customers  an increase in direct sales as a percentage of our total revenue would likely lead to a further increase in our service and other revenue 
cost of product revenue the decrease in cost of product revenue was driven by the decrease in product revenues that we experienced in  as well as the absence of inventory impairment charges and lower product cost levels in  reflecting the results of product cost reduction programs we implemented 
the cost of product revenue included a million charge for excess inventory and impairment of manufacturing assets related to our coolair product family  which  net of current product sales backlog and future spares and support requirements  was reduced to its salvageable value 
cost of product revenue included approximately  and  of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
this has been partially offset by the impact of increased sales of our cps  such as powerhouse 
our margins on powerhouse sales are lower compared to our ups sales because we realize lower margins on the third party equipment that we purchase and include in our powerhouse product 
we also scaled back our production levels in the fourth quarter of deliberately to reduce our inventory levels and to improve overall company liquidity 
as a result  we experienced higher excess capacity costs  which decreased our gross margins because of the higher unabsorbed overhead in the factory 
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue decreased in while service and other revenue increased 
this decrease reflects better utilization of our service personnel in  improved pricing for services and higher margin contract work  as well as higher service volume 
in we saw a increase due to higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world that supported the increase in service revenues we recorded in cost of service and other revenue included approximately  and  of stock based compensation for and  respectively 

table of contents research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products and refinement and standardization of our containerized product solutions 
the decrease in spending compared to is primarily a result of lower headcount and lower prototype expenses 
the prior year expenses included higher prototype and development costs for paralleling our megawatt class ups products 
research and development expense included approximately  and  of stock based compensation in and  respectively 
selling and marketing the decrease in selling and marketing expenses in largely reflects spending controls and lower variable selling expenses on lower sales levels 
although the total headcount has not changed significantly since  we have changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to supporting more direct selling 
we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on developing and improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
selling and marketing expense included approximately  and  of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expense from to reflects lower expenses for executive incentive compensation and lower bad debt allowances in these lower expenses were offset by higher professional fees incurred in connection with the private placement of securities that we made in the second quarter of and with the employee stock option exchange program that we completed in the third quarter of general and administrative expense included approximately  and  of stock based compensation for and  respectively 
interest income the decrease in interest income from to a net expense in is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment during as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves  the decline in interest rates during that lowered our investment returns  and interest expense paid on balances outstanding under our revolving credit arrangement 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at december  are our cash and investments on hand  our bank credit facilities and projected cash flows from operating activities 
if we meet our cash flow projections in our current business plan  we expect that we have adequate capital resources in order to continue operating our business for at least the next months 
our business plan and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs 
however  there are scenarios in which our revenues may not meet our projections  our costs may exceed our estimates or our working capital needs may be greater than anticipated 
further  our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates 
any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage i n and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of approximately million  in a firm commitment underwritten offering made under a shelf registration statement that we had filed with the securities and exchange commission and that had been declared effective in december the proceeds from this offering were designed to strengthen our balance sheet  to help fund our working capital requirements during and beyond  and for general corporate purposes 

table of contents in august  we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with our existing bank  silicon valley bank svb which increased the total availability from million to million subject to certain borrowing bases 
this new facility expanded our ability to borrow funds from us receivables to include qualifying receivables from our uk operations also  increased our ability to use inventory as collateral for borrowing against  and also added an ability to borrow against purchase orders 
these additional bases of borrowing were designed to allow us to use the credit facility to fund inventory purchases in the event we received large or multiple sales orders that would require a major investment in inventory and work in progress such as our powerhouse and infrastructure solutions business  and to help fund continued growth in our business 
this new two year loan facility provides for a secured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount of up to eighty percent of the facility amount of million  or million  subject to certain borrowing bases 
in the event we have maintained unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least million with svb for at least consecutive days  which is referred to as being in a streamline period  the borrowing base formula is based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible purchase orders and eligible inventory  subject to a sublimit of million for uk accounts receivable  million for inventory and million for purchase orders 
when we are not in a streamline period  our borrowings are limited based on accounts receivable and purchase orders that svb has specifically agreed to finan ce and a borrowing base for eligible inventory 
we may also request that svb issue letters of credit on our behalf  of up to million  as a portion of our total loan facility 
on august   the company borrowed approximately million in revolving loans  all of which was used to refinance all indebtedness owing from the company to svb under our previous credit facility 
the new credit facility increases the total credit available from our previous loan facility with svb  which was million  and enables us to borrow against eligible inventory  foreign receivables and customer purchase orders in addition to eligible accounts receivable 
during we have borrowed and repaid amounts under this credit facility based on our short term liquidity requirements 
based on the borrowing base formula  we had an additional million available for use at december  under this credit facility 
when a streamline period is in effect  each advance based upon accounts receivable and inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus one and one half percent and each advance based upon a purchase order inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus two percent 
when a streamline period is not in effect  each advance based upon accounts receivable and inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus three and five eighths percent and each advance based upon a purchase order accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus six and one half percent 
finance charges and interest are payable monthly  and all principal and interest is due on the maturity date of august  however  when we are not in a streamline period  we must repay advances based on receivables when we receive payment on the receivable that has been financed  and we must repay advances based on purchase orders within days of the date of the purchase order  together with all finance charges on such advances 
the revolving loans made to us under this loan facility will be secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
in addition  on august   active power solutions limited  a wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary of the company  entered into a guarantee and debenture with svb the guarantee and debenture  pursuant to which active power solutions limited guarantied all of the obligations of the company under the loan agreement and secured its obligations under the guarantee and debenture with a security interest on substantially all of its assets 
the loan agreement includes customary affirmative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including delivery of financial statements  compliance with laws  maintenance of insurance and protection of intellectual property rights 
further  the loan agreement contains customary negative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including covenants that limit or restrict the company s ability  among other things  to dispose of assets  change its business  change its ceo or cfo without replacing such person within days  have a change in control  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  make distributions  repurchase stock  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the loan agreement also requires the company to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of the liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities plus eligible accounts receivable to all indebtedness owed by the company to svb 
the company is currently in compliance with all loan covenants under the loan agreement 

table of contents the loan agreement contains customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment defaults  covenant defaults  material adverse change defaults  insolvency defaults  material judgment defaults and inaccuracy of representations and warranty defaults 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the loan agreement  in which case the company must repay all loans and related charges  fees and amounts then due and payable  and our subsidiary may be required to pay any such amounts under the guarantee and debenture 
at the election of svb  upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  finance charges or interest rates  as applicable  will increase an additional five percentage points per annum above the rate that is otherwise applicable the reto upon the occurrence of such event of default  and the collateral handling fees will increase by one half percent 
a substantial increase in sales of our powerhouse or our infrastructure solutions products or a substantial increase in ups sales may materially impact the amount of liquidity required to fund our operations 
the amount of time between the receipt of payment from our customers and our expenditures for raw materials  manufacturing and shipment of products the cash cycle for sales of our cleansource ups product can be as short as days  and is typically days 
however  the cash cycle on a powerhouse sale can be as much as days  depending upon customer payment terms 
we intend to mitigate the financial impact of this longer cash cycle by requiring customer deposits and periodic payments where possible from our customers 
this is not always commercially feasible  and in order to increase our powerhouse sales  we may be required to make larger investments in inventory and receivables 
these larger investments may require us to obtain additional sources of working capital  debt or equity financing in order to fund this business 
should additional funding be required  we would expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to othe rs some of our proprietary technology 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash provided by used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash provided by operating activities was 
million in compared to cash used in operating activities of million in  a decrease of  or million 
this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower operating losses 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities  or our net working capital  resulted in cash provided of million in  compared to cash provided from such working capital of million in as our business continues to grow  we have had to finance a larger level of inventory and receivables to support this higher level of activity  particularly with our powerhouse and infrastructure solutions 
our receivables increased by million or during  primarily as a result of a increase in fourth quarter sales compared to the fourth quarter of our inventory decreased by million during  primarily during the fourth quarter as a result of lower work in progress and finished goods inventory on hand 
this  combined with an increase in trade payables of million during and an acceleration of customer payments  allowed us to finance our revenue growth from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter without significant depletion of our available cash and investments 
on an annual bas is  the increase in trade payables offset the increase in receivables  and our inventory levels did not increase as they had in  which combined with lower operating losses resulted in the decrease in funds used in operations 

table of contents our top five customers represent of our total revenue during in addition  as of december   our five largest receivables were of our total receivables 
as a result of this customer concentration  our failure to collect receivables from any of these customers in a timely manner could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity 
this risk may potentially increase as we sell more powerhouse products due to their higher average selling price 
we do continue to request deposits and periodic payments from large customers where commercially possible  particularly for projects with multiple deliverables 
however  the amount of such advance payments can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  depending on the size and scope of customer orders at any point in time 
as a result  we will n eed to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
this concentration is evidenced by the fact that at december  our five largest receivables were of our total receivables 
we used million of cash to fund our operating activities in  which was million or lower than in this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower operating losses 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities  or our net working capital  resulted in cash provided of million in  compared to cash used in such working capital of million in investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these investment funds to finance our ongoing operations 
the cash used in investing activities increased from  in to million in as we had less short term investments available to liquidate to fund our business and due to increased capital expenditures in as we supported our sales and marketing programs 
capital expenditures during decreased slightly from by approximately million and primarily related to equipment to support our sales and marketing activities 
we historically invested in our manufacturing infrastructure and with a production capacity far in excess of our current revenue level we can substantially increase our production levels without needing to make any material capital investments 
our capital expenditures therefore will primarily support expansion of our sales and service capabilities and our marketing and administrative efforts as required 
financing activities funds provided by financing activities during and primarily reflect the sale of common stock by the company 
in february we sold approximately million shares of common stock in a firm commitment underwritten offering at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of million 
these proceeds were designed to strengthen our balance sheet and used to help fund our working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
funds provided by financing activities in reflect the sale of common stock through a private placement to an institutional investor pursuant to which we sold million shares of common stock at per share through a private placement to an institutional investor  which generated million in proceeds 
we expect the level of capital investments to increase in compared to we currently intend to invest in several powerhouse systems to use for demonstration purposes in the us  china and the us to help our sales efforts 
contractual commitments in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations 
table of contents our principal lease commitments consist of our leases for our corporate headquarters and engineering and administration facilities and our global sales offices 
in  we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with svb 
this facility was modified in to increase the limit to million 
in august  we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement with svb 
this new credit facility increased the total liquidity available from million to million subject to certain borrowing bases 
there was million and million outstanding under this facility at december  and  respectively 
future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
our sales cycle is such that we generally have visibility quarters in advance for future orders that allows us to predict revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however  a sudden change in business volume  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business could significantly impact our expected revenues 
the recent global economic downturn has reduced our confidence at predicting future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
a significant increase in sales  especially in our powerhouse or our infrastructure solutions business  would likely increase our working capital requirements  due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of these products 
we expect the level of capital investments to increase in compared to we currently intend to invest in multiple powerhouse systems to use for demonstration purposes in the us  europe and asia to enhance our sales activities and for use as customer rentals 
we also intend to invest further in our facilities in europe and asia to allow us to assemble powerhouse and cps solutions supporting the expansion of our expanding global sales efforts 
other factors that may affect liquidity beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future to help accelerate our growth  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private s ales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted amendments to authoritative literature that modifies the revenue recognition guidance for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable in the arrangement based on relative selling price of the elements 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besp must be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the specific elements on a standalone basis 
the authoritative literature permits prospective or retrospective adoption  and we elected prospective adoption 
other than the increased disclosure requirements of adoption of this policy  the adoption of these amendments did not change our units of accounting  allocation of arrangement consideration  or pattern or timing of revenue recognition 
it also did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows for the year ended december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on interest income or their fair value 
our international sales were historically made in us dollars 
as we have increased sales in foreign markets and opened operations in multiple foreign countries  we have executed more transactions that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales and expenses in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have not been significant to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies as a natural hedge 
however  recent volatility in currencies  particularly with the pound and euro  is increasing the amount of potential translation gains and losses and we may engage in hedging activities in the future to mitigate the risks ca used by such currency volatility 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
