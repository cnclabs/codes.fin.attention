the company s fiscal year begins on april and ends on march unless otherwise noted  all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the company s fiscal year ending on march overview during the last six years  the company won competitively three major contracts craft ramp test set and itats bench test set from the us navy  and the ts a upgrade from the us army 
these units employ tel s new proprietary technology  technology which is expected to give tel a competitive edge in the market for many years to come  and which will be the basis of new competitive products 
the three contracts represent potential revenues of approximately million over the next several years  depending on the number of production options exercised by the military see item  description of business 
in the past few years sales of the company s legacy products have been negatively impacted by weakness in the commercial avionics market and lower than expected government orders 
engineering development for the three new programs has also taken longer than expected due in part to customer required specification changes 
these delays have limited sales growth while engineering expense continued to be high as a result of the company completing the design of the units 
as a result profits have been unsatisfactory for the last two years more recently  the company has completed the engineering of the craft units  and  the us navy completed its evaluation of the company s craft an usm units and found them suitable for use in the fleet 
this unit has also received aims approval  the government s quality certifying authority for iff testing 
as a result of the foregoing  the us navy released pilot production orders for units 
sales from these units as well as sales from our legacy products and from a contract from the air force for a modified version of one of our legacy products in addition to a reduction in engineering expenditures have improved sales and profits 
revenues for fiscal year have increased by  and the operating loss significantly decreased from the fiscal year moreover  each of the last two quarters of fiscal year was profitable  and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year are expected to substantially exceed sales of the comparable quarter of fiscal year in order to raise additional funding to support the increasing volume of sales and as a bridge to the anticipated higher sales and cash flow  the company obtained additional financing 
in september  the company negotiated a five year  million loan with bca mezzanine llp bca see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements

as discussed under business the company is moving its office and plant to larger and more modern premises in august the new plant has the extra needed capacity for increasing sales which the company anticipates for fiscal year and beyond 
the company does not believe that the move will significantly disrupt operations or will result in excessive or unmanageable costs 
the company believes that it has adequate backlog and financing to fund its operations for at least the next months 
results of operations compared to sales for the fiscal year ended march   total sales increased  to  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
avionics government sales increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in government sales is primarily attributed to an increase in shipments of the an usm  an usm and the tr af  a legacy product 
government sales are expected to increase significantly in fiscal year as the company begins volume productions of the an usm and the conversion kits and new units for the ts a program 
avionics commercial sales increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
this increase in sales is the result of the increased shipment of the tr  t c as well as an increase in revenues for repairs and calibrations 
gross margin gross margin increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to the increase in volume

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease is attributed mainly to a decrease in legal fees associated with the aeroflex litigation see item  pending legal proceedings  offset partly by an increase in outside commissions 
engineering  research and development expenses decreased  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of reduced outside contractor expenses associated with the near completion of major programs 
engineering  research and development expenses are mostly attributed to engineering costs related to the ts a and craft programs 
income loss from operations as a result of the above  the company recorded income from operations of  for the year ended march  as compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended march  other income expense  net interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs increased to  mostly as a result of interest on the new million loan from bca  which carries a higher interest rate 
amortization of debt discount is in connection with i the stock options issued in conjunction with the officers subordinated notes and ii warrants issued in conjunction with the loan from bca 
the amortization of deferred debt expense is also associated with the loan from bca 
the company also incurred a non cash loss associated with the revaluation of warrants issued in conjunction with the loan to bca in the amount of  see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss before income taxes as a result of the above  the company recorded a loss before taxes of  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to a loss before taxes of  for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  as compared to an income tax benefit in the amount of  for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the lower loss and tax credits for the current period 
these amounts represent the effective federal and state tax rate on the company s net loss before taxes 
net loss as a result of the above  the company recorded a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of  as compared to  at march  during the year ended march   the company had a net decrease in cash of  the company s principal sources and uses of funds were as follows cash used in operating activities 
for the year ended march   the company used  in cash for operations as compared to using  in cash for the year ended march  the lower operating loss for the period was mostly offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  due to an increase in purchases of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was  as compared to  for the year ended march  in september the company raised million in financing which was offset by financing costs and repayment to the bank of the line of credit 
this cash increase was also offset partially by lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options 
at march  the company s backlog was approximately million as compared to approximately million at march  on april   the company received an order from the us navy for an additional units of the craft an usm totaling approximately million but the navy has recently informed the company that the production release is being delayed pending receipt of a frequency allocation from the faa 
the navy is working cooperatively with tic on this issue and we expect to have this resolved in the next days 
the company believes that it has fully met its contractual requirements and is currently working with the us navy to secure prompt production release 
historically  the company obtains a substantial volume of orders which are required to be filled in less than twelve months  and  therefore  these anticipated orders are not reflected in the backlog 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year the company received approximately  in insurance proceeds as discussed above in the overview 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued in september  the company  pursuant to an agreement with bca mezzanine fund lp  borrowed million for five years 
see overview and note to the financial statements 
on certain government contracts the company has been granted progress payments from the government  which allows the company to bill and collect a portion of its incurred costs on long term programs before shipment of units  thus helping to fund the costs of these programs 
the company believes that it has adequate liquidity  borrowing resources and backlog to fund operating plans for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company has no material capital expenditure requirements 
the company will have moderate moving and capital expenditure costs associated with the upcoming move 
there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended march  critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  the company applies its accounting policies as disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer  provided title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
in certain instances  the company may offer the unit on trial basis 
the company does not recognize revenue until the unit has been accepted 
the company only offers product on trial basis in rare instances  and  as such  no provision has been made at march  and revenues on repairs and calibrations are recognized at the time the repaired or calibrated unit is shipped  as it is at this time that the work is completed 
due to the unique nature of the itats program wherein a significant portion of this contract will not be delivered for over a year  revenues under this contract are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
revenues and profits are estimated using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenues are recognized and profits recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to our estimate of total costs at completion 
the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion is applied to the contract value to determine the revenues and profits 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
the company also receives progress billings on this program  which is a funding mechanism by the government to assist contractors on long term contracts prior to delivery 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as revenue  and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold 
payments received prior to the delivery of units or services performed are recorded as deferred revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
while such write downs have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
for the year ended march  approximately of the company s sales were to the us government 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
income taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are deductible only when the valuation change is realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit which is not more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  future taxable income is estimated  considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event it was determined that the company would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if it were determined that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  tel would decrease the recorded valuation 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
in its evaluation of a valuation allowance the company takes into account existing contracts and backlog  and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products 
the company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic for separating consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
it establishes a hierarchy of selling prices to determine the selling price of each specific deliverable which includes vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither of the first two are available 
this update also eliminates the residual method for allocating revenue between the elements of an arrangement and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement 
finally  this update expands the disclosure requirements regarding a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not anticipate any material impact from this update 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures the update  which provides amendments to accounting standards codification fair value measurements and disclosures overall subtopic of the codification 
the update requires improved disclosures about fair value measurements 
separate disclosures need to be made of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements along with a description of the reasons for the transfers 
also  disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements needs to be made on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
the update also requires fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements  which are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level activity disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the enhanced disclosure requirements have not had a material impact on the company s financial reporting 
with the exception of the pronouncements noted above  no other accounting standards or interpretations issued or recently adopted are expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flows
