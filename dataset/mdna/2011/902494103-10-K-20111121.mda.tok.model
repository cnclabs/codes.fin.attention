item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world s largest meat protein companies and the second largest food production company in the fortune with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry 
we produce  distribute and market chicken  beef  pork  prepared foods and related allied products 
our operations are conducted in four segments chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods 
some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products  the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace  accessibility of international markets  market prices for our products  the cost of live cattle and hogs  raw materials  grain and feed ingredients  and operating efficiencies of our facilities 
overview general as a result of improved internal performance  strong exports and favorable market conditions in our beef and pork segments  our operating results remained strong in fiscal despite a billion increase in input costs 
the following are a few of the key drivers we continued to focus on maximizing our margins through margin management and operational efficiency improvements 
margin management improvements occurred in the areas of mix  export sales  price optimization and value added products initiatives 
the operational efficiencies occurred in the areas of yields  cost reduction  labor management and logistics cost optimization 
strong demand and exports in the beef and pork segments created a favorable pricing environment 
while our chicken segment remained profitable in fiscal  we were challenged by million in increased grain and other feed ingredients costs  as well as excess industry supplies  which made it difficult to pass along the increased input costs 
as a result of balancing our supply with customer demand  we cut production after customer demand fell short of expectations 
recent usda data indicates decreased egg sets  broiler chick placements and slaughter pounds 
however  the impact of these production cuts  and the associated impact on market prices  did not begin to materialize until late fourth quarter and into fiscal with an operating margin of in fiscal  we have achieved operating margins of or better in consecutive years for the first time since the acquisition of ibp  inc 
in the following is a summary of operating margins by segment chicken beef pork prepared foods debt and liquidity during fiscal  we generated billion of operating cash flows 
total debt declined million in fiscal to billion  the lowest level since the acquisition of ibp  inc 
additionally  we repurchased  as part of our previously announced share repurchase program  million shares of our stock for million in fiscal at october   we had billion of liquidity  which includes the availability under our credit facility and million of cash and cash equivalents 
our accounting cycle resulted in a week year for both fiscal and and a week year for fiscal 
table of contents in millions  except per share data net income loss attributable to tyson net income loss attributable to tyson per diluted share net income included the following items million gain related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment  and million reduction to income tax expense related to a reversal of reserves for foreign uncertain tax positions 
net income included the following items million in charges related to losses on notes repurchased during fiscal  million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to a full goodwill impairment in an immaterial chicken segment reporting unit  million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to the impairment of an equity method investment  and million gain from insurance proceeds 
net loss included the following items million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to a goodwill impairment in our beef segment  and million charge related to the closing of our ponca city  oklahoma  processed meats plant 
fiscal outlook usda data indicates overall domestic protein chicken  beef  pork and turkey production is expected to decrease in fiscal because exports are likely to remain strong  we forecast total domestic availability of protein to be down compared to fiscal  which should continue to support improved pricing 
the following is a summary of the fiscal outlook for each of our segments  as well as an outlook on sales  capital expenditures  net interest expense  debt and liquidity and share repurchases chicken for fiscal  we expect industry production will decrease approximately from fiscal  which should gradually improve market pricing conditions 
current futures prices indicate higher grain costs in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect to offset the increased grain costs with operational  pricing and mix improvements 
our chicken segment is currently profitable and we expect it to strengthen throughout the year 
beef we expect to see a gradual reduction in fed cattle supplies of in fiscal as well as exports to remain strong as compared to fiscal despite reduced domestic availability  we expect adequate supplies in the regions we operate our plants 
although current weak industry fundamentals are challenging our beef business  we expect it to be profitable in the first quarter 
we anticipate the fundamentals will strengthen throughout the year and our beef segment will be in our normalized range for fiscal pork we expect hog supplies in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal and to be adequate in the regions in which we operate 
additionally  we expect pork exports to remain strong in fiscal based on these factors  we expect strong fundamentals in our pork business to continue in fiscal prepared foods we expect operational improvements and increased pricing to offset an anticipated increase in raw material costs 
because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing 
however  there is a lag time for price increases to take effect 
we expect improved prepared foods profitability for fiscal primarily due to improvements in our lunchmeats business 
sales we expect sales to exceed billion mostly resulting from price increases related to decreases in domestic availability of protein and rising raw material costs 
capital expenditures our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal is approximately million 
we will continue to make significant investments in our production facilities for high return operational efficiencies  other profit improvement projects and development of our foreign operations 
net interest expense we expect fiscal net interest expense will be approximately million  down million compared to fiscal debt and liquidity we do not have any significant maturities of debt coming due over the next two fiscal years and will continue to use our available cash to repurchase notes when available at attractive rates 
we plan to maintain total liquidity in excess of billion 
share repurchases we expect to continue repurchasing shares under our previously announced share repurchase plan 
in fiscal  we repurchased million shares for approximately million 
as of october   million shares remain authorized for repurchases 
the timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon  among other things  market conditions  liquidity targets  our debt obligations and regulatory requirements
