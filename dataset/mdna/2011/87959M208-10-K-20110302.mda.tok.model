item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs 
our business strategy is to advance our drug product candidates through phase clinical studies  and to enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to assist in further development and commercialization  license product candidates outside our therapeutic focus  and identify and develop additional drug product candidates 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses for the next several years as we continue our research and development activities 
during the year ended december   loss from operations was million and net loss was million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million and net cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments at december  were million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs may require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  interest earned on investments  and non equity payments from collaborative partners 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in november  we implemented a restructuring plan to further reduce our operating expenses and to streamline our infrastructure to focus on our most advanced preclinical and clinical development programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan we reduced our workforce by positions and recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december   which primarily includes employee severance  payroll taxes and other personnel related costs 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the third quarter of changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our products is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 
clinical product development telintra  our lead drug product candidate in clinical development  is a small molecule glutathione analog inhibitor of the enzyme glutathione s transferase p we are developing telintra for the treatment 
table of contents of blood disorders associated with low blood cell levels  such as neutropenia or anemia 
in may  we initiated a phase clinical trial of telintra tablets for the treatment of patients with mds and completed enrollment of patients in our phase clinical trial of telintra tablets for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia  or cin  that was also initiated in may was discontinued in to allow us to focus resources on the development of our mds study 
in june  we announced positive results of our phase clinical trial of telintra tablets for the treatment of patients with mds and presented the data at the annual meeting of ash in december in the second quarter of  we initiated a phase randomized study in scn to determine the effect of telintra tablets on absolute neutrophil count in patients with this disease 
the trial for scn is intended to enroll a total of patients 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase dose ranging study of telintra tablets in combination with lenalidomide in patients with mds 
we expect to complete this patient study by the end of telcyta  our other product candidate  is a small molecule cancer drug product candidate designed to be activated in cancer cells 
telcyta has shown clinical antitumor activity alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in multiple phase and phase clinical trials in refractory or resistant ovarian  non small cell lung  breast and colorectal cancer 
we completed a multicenter  randomized clinical study of patients of telcyta in combination with liposomal doxorubicin versus liposomal doxorubicin as second line therapy in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer and announced results at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  in may in may  we initiated an investigator led study at a single site of telcyta in patients with refractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and multiple myeloma 
enrollment for this study is expected to range between to patients based on the number of responses observed 
we are currently seeking a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to further advance the development and commercialization of telcyta 
preclinical drug product development tlk aurora kinase vegfr inhibitors we have a small molecule compound inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
aurora kinase is a signaling enzyme whose function is required for cancer cell division  while vegf plays a key role in tumor blood vessel formation  ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients to support tumor growth 
the lead compounds of our first dual inhibitor program met a development milestone in august by demonstrating anticancer activity in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia 
these lead compounds prevented tumor growth in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia by inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
our data support the concept that dual inhibition of aurora kinase and vegfr kinase represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy 
a development drug product candidate  tlk  has been selected 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies that if successful may support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
tlk antimitotic agent using our trap technology  we have discovered tlk  a novel  potent small molecule inhibitor of cell division 
tlk inhibits the formation of microtubules that are necessary for cancer cell growth leading to persistent cancer cell block and subsequent cell death at the g m cell cycle 
this compound demonstrates potent broad spectrum anticancer activity against a number of human cancer cells 
this compound also displays oral efficacy in multiple  standard preclinical models of cancer 
tlk is currently being evaluated in preclinical safety studies 
tlk vegfr inhibitor tlk is a small molecule dual inhibitor of vegfr and vegfr kinase 
vegfr kinases are known to mediate the formation of new blood vessels in human cancers allowing them to grow 
in standard animal models of human colon cancer  oral administration of tlk significantly reduced tumor growth 
tlk is undergoing further preclinical assessment 

table of contents other we discovered all of our drug product candidates using our proprietary technology  trap  which we believe enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule drug product candidates 
we expect to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties  such as contract research organizations for clinical trials  development  manufacturing  regulatory approvals or commercialization of some of our products  particularly outside north america  or in disease areas requiring larger and longer clinical trials than cancer 
nasdaq stock listing compliance on september   we received notification from nasdaq informing us that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
effective january   we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
on april   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
since may   the bid price for our common stock had again fluctuated below the levels required by nasdaq rules for continued listing 
on july   we received notice from nasdaq that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market 
on february   we received a notice from nasdaq indicating that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
ubs purchase rights and loan on november   we entered into a rights agreement with ubs ag and with its affiliates  or ubs  whereby we received rights  or the right  to sell all our auction rate securities  or ars  held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  ubs was also granted the right to purchase or sell our ars at any time after acceptance of the rights agreement until july   so long as we received par value for the ars 
in connection with our acceptance of the offer to enter into the agreement  ubs made available to us no net cost loans for up to of the market value of our ars  where interest payable on the loan did not exceed interest earned on our ars 
the loan was secured by our ars 
on december   we borrowed million from ubs in accordance with such a secured  no net cost demand facility 
on june  and february   ubs elected to repurchase a portion of our ars under the rights agreement at par value of million and million  respectively 
proceeds from sales of our ars were applied to the repayments of the credit line  which was paid in full in february for the year ended december   interest paid on the loan was approximately  which was offset entirely by interest earned on the pledged securities 
on july   we exercised the right to sell all our remaining ars to ubs under the rights agreement at par value of million 
proceeds from the sale have been re invested in us government agency securities and we no longer have any ars investments in our portfolio 
to date  we have not incurred any losses on our ars investments  total par value of million  as a result of the rights agreement with ubs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
table of contents under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
fair value measurements we invest our excess cash in money market funds  cash deposits  debt instruments of the us government agency securities  auction rate securities  or ars  and corporate notes 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective 
accounting standards codification  or asc   fair value measurements and disclosure  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
in the past  we used level assumptions to estimate our ars investments 
since late the auctions for our ars continued to fail and as a result these investments were not trading and therefore did not have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximated par value 
our ars were held by ubs  one of our investment providers 
on november   we accepted an offer  the right  from ubs entitling us to sell our ars originally purchased from ubs at par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  we valued this put option using a discounted cash flow model based on level assumptions 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars and the put option included estimates of  based on data as of the reporting period then ended  interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  expected holding periods of the ars  loan rates per the ubs rights offering and bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions were volatile and subject to change  and therefore could result in significant changes to the fair value of ars 
in july  we exercised the right from ubs to sell all our remaining ars to ubs and we no longer held any ars in our investment accounts 
see notes and in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
stock based compensation expense we used the fair value method under asc  compensation stock compensation to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provided for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
under asc  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the 
table of contents use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
from january  to june   a blended rate of historical volatility and implied volatility was used to determine our expected stock price volatility since we had sufficient market activity existed with respect to our traded options during such period 
for the period from july  to december   the expected volatility was based solely on historical volatility as there was insufficient traded option activity resulting from our declining stock price 
we did not use any expected volatility assumptions for as there were no options granted during the year 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  topic d  as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
sab topic d was effective on january  and provided guidance to issuers on the method allowed in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with asc sab topic d allows companies to continue to use the simplified method  under certain circumstances  beyond december  asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we evaluate our forfeiture rate to reflect actual historical and expected cancellations of unvested options periodically 
our forfeiture rate for  and was at 
see also note  stockholders equity  in the notes to financial statements for further information 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the compensation expense that we will then record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
exit and disposal activities we record costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities  as defined in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  at fair value in the period the liability is incurred 
asc requires that the estimated future cash flows to be used in the fair value calculation be discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate and that such interest rate shall have a maturity date that approximates the expected timing of future cash flows 
future cash flows related to lease obligations shall include the effect of sublease rental income and other lease operating expenses 
in addition  accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is recorded as a general and administrative expense 
see note facility exit costs in the notes to financial statements for further information 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations  and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed during a given period of time over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with third party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and third party service providers of the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services in each agreement 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the third party organizations as measured by patient enrollment levels 
table of contents and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
conversely  over estimation of activity levels could result in accrued expenses being reversed in future periods 
use of estimates in preparing our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
results of operations revenues we had no collaborative research agreements in  and and currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future non product revenues  if any  will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following decreased costs of approximately million in connection with headcount reduction as a result of our restructuring in and reduced research activities  decreased expenses of approximately  for tlk cytotoxic small molecule pre clinical development program due to the reprioritization of our focus on other compounds  decreased clinical trial expenses of approximately  related to the completion our phase telintra tablets for mds and the discontinuation of our phase telintra tablets for cin  offset by a  increase in clinical development expenses for our ongoing phase dose ranging study of telintra tablets in combination with lenalidomide in patients with mds  phase telintra tablets randomized study in scn and telcyta in patients with refractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and multiple myeloma clinical studies  
table of contents increased stock based compensation expense of approximately  primarily due to more stock options vested in  and in addition  the year ended december  included approximately  reduction in accrued clinical trials expenses as a result of final close out of clinical sites for completed clinical studies while there were no such adjustments in stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following decreased costs of approximately million in connection with headcount reduction as a result of our february restructuring and reduced research activities  lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to lower headcount associated with fewer outstanding options vested  reduced expenses of approximately million as phase clinical trial study activities in our assist  assist  assist and assist were completed  decreased costs of approximately  as our telcyta phase combination trials in ovarian and lung cancer were completed and approximately  due to completion of phase a telintra oral formulation clinical trials for mds 
these reductions were offset by increased expenses of approximately million for ongoing phase clinical trials of telintra tablets  and increased expenses of approximately  for tlk cytotoxic small molecule and tlk aurora kinase preclinical development programs 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and million 
we expect total research and development expenditures to continue to decrease in the next twelve months as we focus our resources mainly on advancing the clinical development of telintra in mds 
the following table summarizes our principal drug product candidate development initiatives related r d expenses years ended december  product in thousands telintra telcyta tlk tlk other total research and development expenses other constitutes research and development activities performed by our chemistry  biology  preclinical and quality assurance departments as these costs cannot be allocated to any individual project 

table of contents the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investment in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate  and filing by the company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a nda for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  or million  in  compared to the same period in  was primarily due a decrease of  in headcount and corporate administrative expenses  decreased stock based compensation expense of approximately  as a result of higher fair value stock options fully vested in and a decrease of  in legal and professional service expenses 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of  or  in  compared to the same period in  was primarily due to increased legal and professional service expenses of approximately  related to corporate matters and business development activities and increased allocation of facility related expenses of approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense of approximately  as a result of lower fair values of options vested and a decrease of approximately  in expenses related primarily to lower insurance expenses 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to be lower than the spending level as we undertake efforts to control expenses 
facility exit costs years ended december  in thousands facility exit costs 
table of contents in november  we ceased the use of our facility at porter drive in palo alto  california and subleased the facility to a tenant for the remaining contractual term of our master lease  which is through may we recorded a facility exit charge of million to the statement of operations  which included million of estimated present value of future lease related payments through may  less estimated sublease income  and an impairment charge of million in leasehold improvements for this facility as the facility would not have any future benefits to us and their estimated fair values were determined to be zero  offset by a reduction of  in the balance of deferred rent as of november  restructuring costs years ended december  in thousands restructuring costs we have implemented workforce reductions over the past several years to reduce our operating expenses and to streamline our infrastructure based on our current preclinical and clinical trial projects 
in november  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance costs  health benefits and other personnel related charges relating to a workforce reduction of eleven positions 
in february  we implemented a restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by positions and recorded a charge of approximately  in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance costs and health benefits charges relating to a workforce reduction of seven positions 
interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net interest expense n a interest and other income expense  net were million   and million for the years ended december   and the increase of approximately  in compared to the same period in was due primarily to a million qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant received from the internal revenue service department of treasury and was partially offset by a decrease of  in investment income resulting from lower investment cash balances and a net decrease of  due to a loss of  on the disposal of computer and laboratory equipment in compared to a gain of  recorded in the decrease of approximately million in compared to the same period in was due primarily to a decrease of million in investment income resulting from lower investment cash balances and lower interest rates 
in addition  the year ended december  included a gain of million from the ars right offered by ubs which largely offset the losses recorded on our ars due to reclassification of these securities from available for sale to trading of approximately million while there was no such adjustment in the decrease for was further offset by a  gain on the sale of computer and laboratory equipment 
interest expenses for the periods reported were solely for interest payments on our ubs loan 
the decrease of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the full payment of our ubs loan balance in february we had no interest expenses for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december  we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared to million for the same period in and in net loss of million in included non cash charges of million of facility exit costs associated with the relocation of our principal executive offices  million for stock based compensation and  for depreciation and amortization 
the increase in accounts payable balance was offset by reductions in accrued expenses and did not have a significant impact on cash used in operations for cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation   for depreciation and amortization and million for the reduction in value of the put option associated with the ubs ars right and were partially offset by a million increase in the fair value of marketable securities and a  gain on the disposal of property and equipment 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million decrease in accounts payable and a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to final study payments as a result of the completion of our phase clinical trials 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  for depreciation and amortization  million for the write down of marketable securities and were partially offset by a gain of million recorded upon initial recognition of a put option associated with the ars rights with ubs 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the completion of our assist   and clinical trials and a million reduction in accrued legal and related expenses primarily for amounts paid in connection with the class action lawsuit  partially offset by a decrease of  in interest receivables as a result of lower interest rates and investment balances and a  increase in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for and cash provided by investing activities in of million 
cash provided in was primarily from million in investment maturities and million in investment sales which included million in sales of our ars to ubs and was partially offset by the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
cash used in was primarily for the 
table of contents purchase of available for sale investments of million and was partially offset by  in investment sales  million in investment maturities and  in proceeds from the sale of property 
cash provided for was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities for was approximately million compared to  provided by financing activities in and million in cash used in financing activities for was primarily due to million payment of our remaining ubs loan balance on february   offset by  in proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities for comprised of  in proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in comprised of million in loan proceeds from ubs and  in proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash for our clinical studies  pre clinical programs and operating expenses 
as a result of our relocation to a smaller facility and restructuring plan implemented in november  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the third quarter of changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing may subject us to restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows total after in thousands operating leases 
table of contents in november  we entered into arrangements to sublease our facility located at porter drive in palo alto  california  which consists of approximately  square feet of research and office space 
the sublease term commenced in november and will expire on may   the date on which the current term of our master lease expires 
however  if the master lease is terminated for any reason prior to this date  the sublease will terminate concurrently 
on november   telik entered into an arrangement to sublease a facility at hansen way  palo alto  california in which to relocate our principal executive offices 
the term of the hansen sublease commenced on november  and expires on march   the date on which the current term of the hansen master lease expires 
however  if the hansen master lease is terminated for any reason prior to this date  the hansen sublease will terminate concurrently 
we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with amri wherein we are obligated to purchase a majority of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
however  we currently do not have any requirements for the active ingredient 
we have agreed on a pricing schedule for such supply  which will be subject to future renegotiation after a defined time period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments  however we are exposed to market risk related to changes interest rates and market conditions 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury and us government agency securities with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
