overview of the company and developments oncogenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients 
we have five product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen  ogx  ogx  sn and csp  each of which has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development 
of the product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen  ogx and sn are clinical stage assets 
our product candidates custirsen  ogx and ogx focus on mechanisms for treating resistance in cancer patients and are designed to address treatment resistance by blocking the production of specific proteins that we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments 
our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell s adaptive defenses  thereby rendering the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies  including chemotherapy 
we believe this approach will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients 
product candidate sn is a novel camptothecin for treating cancer 
camptothecins are potent anticancer agents that belong to the family of drugs called topoisomerase i inhibitors that bind reversibly to the topo i dna complex  thereby causing breaks in the dna strands during replication that result in cell death 
product candidate csp is the lead compound from a family of caspase activators that have been in licensed from bayer and demonstrate activation of programmed cell death in pre clinical models 

table of contents product candidate custirsen as discussed above  in december  we announced our entry into the collaboration agreement with teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds targeting clusterin  excluding ogx and ogx 
we and teva have developed a clinical development plan under which two phase clinical trials have been initiated and one additional phase clinical trial will be initiated 
we have designed two of the phase clinical trials to evaluate the clinical benefit of custirsen in patients with crpc and  together with teva  we are in the process of designing a third phase clinical trial to evaluate the clinical benefit of custirsen in nsclc  as follows the phase saturn trial to evaluate a durable pain palliation benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel retreatment as second line chemotherapy in approximately patients with crpc  which was initiated in the second quarter of the phase synergy trial to be conducted in approximately cancer centers to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first line docetaxel treatment in approximately patients with crpc  which was initiated in the third quarter of a phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first line chemotherapy in patients with nsclc  which is expected to be initiated in following successful manufacturing of additional custirsen drug product and completion of ddi studies 
the trial is expected to enroll approximately patients 
the study protocol will include two futility assessments and one interim analysis for efficacy 
the first line chemotherapy regimen has been selected as carboplatin and paclitaxel 
for detailed information regarding our relationship with teva and the collaboration agreement  refer to the discussion under the heading business license and collaboration agreements teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
custirsen received fast track designations from the fda for the treatment of progressive metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel for both first and second line docetaxel treatment 
the fda has agreed on the design of two phase registration trials  each in crpc  via the spa process 
the synergy trial design investigates overall survival as the primary endpoint for custirsen in combination with first line chemotherapy  whereas the other trial design  the saturn trial  investigates pain palliation as the primary endpoint for custirsen in combination with second line chemotherapy 
in february  custirsen received written  scientific advice from the ema on our development plan for custirsen for treating patients with crpc  which advice corresponded with our development plan regarding the proposed pre clinical studies and both the study designs and analyses for the phase trials 
the chmp also agreed that the intended safety database would enable a sufficient qualified risk benefit assessment for market approval 

table of contents our phase registration trials are designed to build on our phase clinical trials  including a randomized phase trial evaluating the benefit of combining custirsen with first line docetaxel  the final results of which were published in the september  issue of the journal of clinical oncology 
analyses indicating a survival benefit in patients treated with custirsen in combination with first line docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone  the latter being the current standard of care for patients with advanced  progressive metastatic prostate cancer requiring initial chemotherapy  are described in our annual report on form k filed on march  under the heading business our product candidates custirsen summary of final results of custirsen phase clinical trial in patients with crpc receiving custirsen and docetaxel as first line chemotherapy 
due to the results of the phase trial  the synergy trial  which was initiated in third quarter of  will evaluate the survival benefit of custirsen in patients treated with first line chemotherapy 
durable pain palliation  defined as pain palliation of weeks or greater  which has been observed in another phase trial evaluating patients with metastatic crpc who progressed while receiving  or within six months of completing  first line docetaxel treatment 
of the patients on this trial who had pain or were on opioids for pain control and were retreated with docetaxel as second line treatment in combination with custirsen  approximately had durable pain palliation 
this is favorable even when compared to the pain responses of three weeks or greater observed in the phase trial  which supported the registration of docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in patients with crpc  and when compared to the pain responses for cabazitaxel of and for mitoxantrone of observed in the phase tropic trial 
due to the results of our phase trial  the saturn trial  which was initiated in the second quarter of  is evaluating the durable pain palliation benefit of custirsen in patients treated with second line docetaxel 
the saturn trial will enroll patients in approximately cancer centers who have previously responded to first line docetaxel therapy  but who subsequently experienced disease progression involving prostate cancer related pain despite opioid usage 
a phase trial evaluating patients with advanced nsclc who received custirsen in combination with gemcitabine and a platinum chemotherapy cisplatin or carboplatin as first line chemotherapy 
the median overall survival was months and of patients survived at least one year 
thirty percent of patients who received custirsen with first line chemotherapy survived at least two years 
for comparison  published studies using a platinum based regimen plus gemcitabine as first line chemotherapy for advanced nsclc reported median survivals of to months and one year survival rates of to 
market approval for avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy for nsclc was based on results showing a median survival of months compared to months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
survival rates for avastin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were reported as versus at one year and versus at two years  respectively 
the protocol for the custirsen phase registration trial in advanced  unresectable nsclc has yet to be finalized 
teva is expected to initiate this trial in  which will assess overall survival as the primary endpoint 
product candidate ogx ogx is a product candidate that  in pre clinical experiments  inhibits production of hsp  a cell survival protein found at elevated levels in many human cancers  including prostate  lung  breast  ovarian  bladder  renal  pancreatic  multiple myeloma and liver cancer 
many anti cancer therapies are known to further elevate hsp levels 
for example  hsp levels increased four fold in prostate cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy or hormone therapy 
increased levels of hsp in some human cancers are associated with metastases  poor prognosis and resistance to radiation or chemotherapy 
ogx has been evaluated in a phase trial in patients with breast  prostate  ovarian  or non small cell lung cancer who have failed potentially curative treatments or for which a curative treatment does not exist 
final results of this phase trial were presented during an oral presentation at the asco annual meeting 
the phase trial evaluated patients treated with ogx as a single agent and patients with ogx in combination with docetaxel who had failed up to six prior chemotherapy treatments 
ogx as a single agent administered weekly was evaluated at doses from mg up to mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients in each cohort 
two further cohorts tested ogx at the and mg doses combined with docetaxel 
patients could receive up to day cycles 
ogx was well tolerated both as a monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel 
most adverse events were mild grade or and mainly occurred during the three loading doses given over nine days prior to weekly dosing 
the majority of adverse events potentially related to ogx consisted of grade or fever  chills  itching  or flushing associated with the infusion of ogx and fatigue 
despite evaluating ogx at very high doses  a maximum tolerated dose for ogx was not reached in this trial 

table of contents of particular interest was the decrease at all doses and in all diseases evaluated in the trial for both total ctcs  and ctcs which were positive for hsp  hsp ctcs 
recent studies have shown that the presence of ctcs in peripheral blood may be of prognostic significance for patients with solid tumors  and patients with values of five tumor cells or less are generally considered to have a more favorable prognosis 
when ogx was used as monotherapy  of evaluable patients had a decrease in measurable disease of or greater 
in this heavily pretreated patient population  two of four patients with ovarian cancer had a decrease of or greater in ca an ovarian tumor marker and of patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of or greater in psa a prostate tumor marker 
hsp ctcs decreases were noted in of evaluable patients and were observed at all dose levels and all diseases evaluated 
in of patients with hsp ctcs at baseline  hsp ctcs had decreased to five tumor cells or less 
in addition  serum hsp protein levels were decreased by or greater over a period of at least six weeks in approximately of patients at the and mg doses 
when ogx was combined with docetaxel  of patients had a decrease in measurable disease of or greater 
five of nine patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of or greater in psa 
again  decreases in both total ctcs and hsp ctcs were observed 
hsp ctcs were decreased in of evaluable patients 
in four of seven patients with hsp ctcs at baseline  hsp ctcs had decreased to five cells or less 
serum hsp protein levels were decreased by or greater over a time period of at least six weeks in approximately of patients 
an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with bladder cancer was initiated in august we are in the process of accruing patients for this trial  in which we will enroll up to patients 
the trial is designed to determine the safety and potential benefit of ogx administered directly into the bladder using a catheter  which is known as intravesical instillation 
in addition  the trial will measure the direct effect of ogx on expression of hsp in bladder tumor cells  as well as determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ogx when delivered by intravesical instillation 
this investigator sponsored trial is funded by the national cancer institute of canada 
in september  we announced the initiation of a separate investigator sponsored  randomized phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered as a monotherapy to patients with crpc 
the randomized  controlled phase trial will enroll up to patients who have minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy  and is designed to determine the potential benefit of ogx by evaluating the number of patients who are without disease progression at weeks post trial treatment with or without ogx this phase trial will also measure the direct effect of ogx on psa levels  time to progression by psa or measurable disease  numbers of ctcs and other relevant secondary endpoints 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  in october  we received million in net proceeds from a public offering 
we expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from that offering to fund a phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with metastatic bladder cancer 
the proposed trial design is a three arm  randomized phase in combination with standard chemotherapy in the first line metastatic setting 
each arm would enroll approximately patients and the trial would be initiated in sites throughout the united states  canada and europe 
we are consulting with external bladder cancer experts and anticipate the final protocol to be completed in early this trial  which is expected to begin in the second half of  will complement the phase clinical trial in prostate cancer  and phase clinical trial in superficial bladder cancer 
we are currently evaluating various alternatives  including partnering  which would allow us to expand the ogx development plan beyond the ongoing bladder cancer and crpc trials and the planned randomized phase bladder cancer trial 
product candidates ogx  sn and csp sn was evaluated in a phase clinical trial to evaluate safety in patients with advanced cancer who have received on average three to five prior chemotherapy treatments 
sn was administered to patients with various types of cancer in this phase clinical trial 
the phase clinical trial was completed and the dose limiting toxicity that defined a maximum tolerated dose in this heavily pretreated patient population was determined 
we do not intend to initiate additional trials for sn but will seek to out license or sell this product candidate to a third party 
ogx  an inhibitor of insulin growth factor binding proteins and  and csp are in pre clinical development 

table of contents collaboration revenue we recorded million of collaboration revenue in connection with our collaboration agreement with teva in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  at december   an aggregate of million of the upfront payment was included in the balance sheet line items current and long term deferred collaboration revenue  which we are amortizing over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the collaboration agreement 
management currently expects this performance period to end in the fourth quarter of further  we are eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments  although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments from teva in the year ending december  moreover  isis has disclosed in its securities and exchange commission  or sec  filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement 
we disagree with their assessment but believe there may be some lesser payment obligation 
there was no revenue in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of costs for milestone payments to third parties  clinical trials  materials and supplies  facilities  personnel  including salaries and benefits  regulatory activities  pre clinical studies  and allocations of other r d related costs 
external r d expenses include fees paid to universities  hospitals and other entities that conduct certain r d activities and that manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
currently  we manage our clinical trials through independent medical investigators at their sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue 
under the collaboration agreement with teva  we are required to spend million towards development of custirsen  which will include our personnel costs for certain development activities 
teva will fund all other expenses incurred pursuant to the clinical development plan 
costs that we incurred totaling million of in and million in have been applied against our million funding commitment  resulting in a remaining funding commitment of million at december  we expect aggregate full time equivalent reimbursement of between and million annually from to  which will be applied against our funding commitment  or reimbursed to us from teva on a cash basis 
we currently expect that we will incur all remaining costs associated with the clinical development plan by the fourth quarter of a majority of our expenditures to date have been related to the development of custirsen 
until july   custirsen was being co developed with isis and r d expenses for custirsen were shared by us and by isis 
on july   we and isis amended the agreement to provide for unilateral development of custirsen by us 
in connection with the collaboration agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between us and isis relating to custirsen  we paid million to isis in the first quarter of  which was included in r d expenses in we also paid  to ubc in the first quarter of pursuant to the terms of the license agreement relating to custirsen  which was also included in r d expenses in several of our clinical trials have been supported by grant funding that was received directly by the hospitals and or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials  thereby allowing us to complete these clinical trials at a lower cost to us 
since our drug candidates are in the early stages of development  we cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our r d projects  if ever 

table of contents our projects or intended r d activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
we expect our r d expenses to increase in and into the future  likely significantly  as we further expand development of custirsen  ogx and our other programs 
our programs or anticipated programs may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive  business development  human resources  external communications  finance and other administrative functions  as well as consulting costs  including market research and business consulting  and intellectual property 
other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services  insurance and facility costs 
we believe that g a resources are sufficient to carry on existing development activities 
we anticipate that g a expenses will increase in the future as we continue to expand our operating activities 
restructuring activities on august   immediately following the completion of the arrangement  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
severance payable at the date of the arrangement in connection with former sonus employees of million  and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  as part of the purchase price allocation 
during  we made payments totaling million and the amount owing at december  was  all remaining severance liabilities relating to arrangement related workforce reductions were paid during prior to the arrangement  sonus entered into a non cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in bothell  washington  which is in excess of our current requirements 
we are currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space and recorded an initial restructuring charge of million in august as part of the purchase price allocation 
the liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses  and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
and represents our best estimate of the liability 
subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion  or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions  will be recognized as adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods 
in june  we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the excess lease facility liability 
these assumptions were subsequently further revised in december and september these changes in estimate resulted in increases in the value of the excess lease liability of million  million  and million in expense recorded in june  december  and september  respectively 
in the year ended december   million was amortized into income through r d expense  resulting in a remaining liability with respect to excess facilities of million at december  results of operations our consolidated financial statements reflect the arrangement between sonus and oncogenex technologies as a reverse acquisition and oncogenex technologies was deemed to be the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective 
accordingly  for the year ended december   the consolidated results of operations include only the results of operations of oncogenex technologies for the time period of january  through august  and the results of the combined company following the completion of the arrangement on august  this treatment and presentation is in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
pro forma results are included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents years ended december  and december  revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was due to lower revenue earned through our strategic collaboration with teva for the development of custirsen  which we entered into in december revenue for includes recognition of million from the million upfront payment  as well as million earned through collaborative research  which has been reimbursed to us on a cash basis 
at december   million of the upfront payment received from teva in december was included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred collaboration revenue  which we are amortizing over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the collaboration agreement 
management currently expects this performance period to end in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
r d expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was due primarily to milestones owed to isis and ubc resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva 
this decrease in milestone expense was offset by higher manufacturing costs  employee costs and clinical trial costs associated with the custirsen phase clinical trials 
costs for the custirsen phase clinical trials are applied against the non refundable upfront payments received from teva in december  while manufacturing costs are reimbursable from teva on a cash basis 
we expect r d expenses to increase as we further develop our proprietary product candidates 
g a expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to higher employee expenses  including severance charges  professional fees for legal and auditing services  employee recruitment costs and stock based compensation expense 
restructuring expense for the year ended december  was million 
in september  we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the value of the excess lease facility liability 
this change in estimate resulted in an increase in the value of our excess lease liability and a million restructuring expense recorded in september to reflect this change in estimate 
similar changes in our sublease income assumptions resulted in million in expense recorded in we recorded million warrant issuance cost expense for the year ended december   relating to the issuance costs allocated to warrants as part of the october financing 
this expense was offset by a million gain on revaluation of the warrants at december  which is included on our consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on warrants 
we revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value 
if unexercised  the warrants will expire in october there was no comparable charge in interest income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  due to higher balances of interest bearing securities in as compared to other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the income earned in relates to gains on the sales of equipment offset by foreign exchange losses  while income earned in relates to gains on sales of equipment and foreign exchange gains 
an income tax recovery of million was recorded in the second quarter of  as we received approval from the israeli tax authority  or ita  for its request for a withholdings tax exemption on amounts received from teva in relation to the collaboration 
under the collaboration agreement  teva paid us million in upfront payments  of which million was for an upfront milestone payment and subject to possible withholding taxes by the ita 
prior to the receipt of the approval  teva was granted a temporary exemption for a transfer of million of the million upfront milestone payment 
this temporary exemption was conditioned upon teva s depositing million  which represented of the upfront milestone payment paid according to the collaboration agreement  in a trust account in favor of the ita until a final decision would be made by the ita regarding the request 
accordingly  prior to the receipt of the approval  we had recorded a million liability recognizing this amount as an uncertain tax position 
following this approval from the ita  this liability was released  and we recorded a million income tax recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our collaboration with teva 

table of contents years ended december  and december  we recorded million of collaboration revenue in connection with our collaboration agreement with teva in the year ended december  at december   million of the upfront payment was included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred collaboration revenue and deferred collaboration revenue  net of current  which we are amortizing over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the collaboration agreement 
we currently expect this performance period to end in the fourth quarter of there was no revenue in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our collaboration with teva 
r d expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher custirsen and ogx development costs  milestone payments owed to isis and ubc resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva  an increase in employee expenses and higher facility costs resulting from the arrangement 
the expense included a scientific research and experimental development  or sred  claim of million  which offset r d expenses in the period 
since oncogenex technologies ceased to be a canadian controlled private company under canadian tax laws as a result of the arrangement  sred claims can now only be applied against taxes payable to canada 
the sred program is a canadian federal tax incentive program that encourages canadian businesses to conduct r d in canada 
g a expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher employee expenses and increased costs associated with operating as a public company 
restructuring expense for the year ended december  was million  reflecting changes in the liability estimate relating to our bothell office space  which resulted in an increase in the value of our excess lease liability 
there was no comparable charge recorded in the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  of the interest amount   related to interest received from the canada revenue agency in relation to our sred claim  while the amount includes only interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
there was no interest payable on sred claims in the period 
other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from to  for the year ended december   due to lower gains on sales of equipment 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial and increasing additional losses in the future as we expand our r d activities and other operations  as more fully described below 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate product sales revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the collaboration agreement with teva 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our equity securities  and upfront payments received from teva 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased to million in the aggregate from million as of december  as of december   we do not have any borrowing or credit facilities 
based on our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into our currently planned operations are set forth below under the heading operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 

table of contents cash flows cash used in operations for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities increased to million  from in cash provided by operations in this increase in cash used in operations is primarily attributable to increased r d expenses associated with manufacturing custirsen  payments associated with custirsen clinical trial activities  and payments made to isis and ubc in the first quarter of resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva 
cash provided by operations in was predominantly due to the upfront cash payment from teva  offset by operating expenses 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations of million was attributable primarily to our losses from operating activities and cash used to reduce liabilities assumed in the arrangement 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities increased to million from million 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds we received from the public offering that closed in october net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock through a registered direct offering and net proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock to teva as part of the share purchase agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was  resulting from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock on stock option exercises  offset by cash paid on the elimination of fractional shares following the one for eighteen reverse stock split 
cash used provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million in cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  net cash used in or provided by investing activities in the years ended december  and december  were due to transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was million  resulting from the arrangement and transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into  including completing the saturn trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a durable pain palliation benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in approximately patients with crpc  which was initiated in the second quarter of completing the synergy trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in approximately patients with crpc  which was initiated in the third quarter of  completing patient accrual in a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in patients with advanced  unresectable nsclc  which is expected to be initiated in  completing an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in patients with prostate cancer  and completing a phase clinical trial evaluating ogx in combination with standard first line chemotherapy in approximately patients with metastatic bladder cancer 

table of contents as of december   we have a remaining commitment to fund million towards the three phase trials of custirsen  while teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the clinical development plan 
the final results from the phase trials may be released at a date that is beyond the period for which we currently project we have available cash resources 
in addition  if we desire to conduct development activities with respect to our other product candidates beyond those development activities mentioned in the list above  we will require additional funding to support such operations 
if we need to extend our cash availability  or to conduct any such currently unplanned development activities  we would seek such necessary funding through the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  by executing a partnership or collaboration agreement  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including timing  costs and results of clinical trials  preclinical development and regulatory approvals  success of custirsen and achieving milestones and royalties  maintaining our relationship with teva and teva s ongoing level of focus and efforts to develop custirsen  timing  costs and results of drug discovery and r d  entering into new collaborative or product license agreements for products in our pipeline  our ability to obtain additional funding through a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party or licenses of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt  and costs related to obtaining  defending and enforcing patents

contingencies and commitments teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in december  oncogenex pharmaceuticals  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  entered into a collaboration agreement with teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds 
under the collaboration agreement  teva made upfront payments in the aggregate amount of million  up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid teens to mid twenties on net sales 
we are required to contribute million in direct and indirect costs towards the clinical development plan 
we incurred million of these costs in and  resulting in a remaining funding responsibility of million  which has been recorded as deferred collaboration revenue 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  we and teva agreed to collaborate in the development and global commercialization of custirsen 
teva received the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds 
we have an option to co promote custirsen in the united states and canada 
in addition to the development costs noted above  teva is also responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization  including costs incurred in relation to our co promotion option  except for start up costs in advance of commercialization 
isis pharmaceuticals inc and university of british columbia pursuant to license agreements we have with ubc and isis  we are obligated to pay milestone payments of up to cad million and cad million  respectively  upon achieving specified product development milestones related to ogx and ogx and royalties on future product sales 
in addition  we are required to pay to isis of all non royalty revenue we receive 
isis has disclosed in its sec filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement  however  we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as royalty revenue  and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations 
no assurance can be provided that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or  if we are  that the applicable amount payable to isis will be less than 
we are also obligated to pay to ubc certain patent costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of cad  per year 
we paid isis and ubc  and cad  respectively  in upon the initiation of a phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with crpc 
these payments were included in r d expense 
we do not anticipate making any royalty payments to isis in the ubc agreements have effective dates ranging from november  to april  and each agreement expires upon the later of years from its effective date or the expiry of the last patent licensed thereunder  unless otherwise terminated 
unless otherwise terminated  the isis agreements for custirsen and ogx will continue for each product until the later of years after the date of the first commercial product sale  or the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the product  unless oncogenex technologies abandons either custirsen or ogx and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 
the isis agreement for ogx will continue into perpetuity unless oncogenex technologies abandons the product and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 

table of contents to facilitate the execution and performance of the collaboration agreement with teva  we and isis agreed to amend the isis license agreement and we and ubc agreed to amend the ubc license agreement  in each case  effective december and december   respectively 
the amendment to the isis license agreement provides  among other things  that if we are the subject of a change of control with a third party  where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product  then i a milestone payment of million will be due and payable to isis days following the first commercial sale of the product in the united states  and ii unless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to isis by us has been established  the applicable royalty rate payable to isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the isis license agreement 
any non royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited towards the million milestone if not already paid 
as a result of the million milestone payment payable to isis in relation to the collaboration agreement  the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of million 
as we have licensed the product to teva and established a royalty rate payable to isis  no royalty rate adjustments would apply if teva acquires us and is the surviving company 
if we have not spent the million in advanced reimbursement of development activities prior to the third anniversary of the collaboration agreement with teva  we will pay isis an amount equal to of any un spent portion less million 
bayer healthcare llc on august   sonus completed an exclusive in licensing agreement with bayer healthcare llc for the right to develop  commercialize or sublicense a family of compounds known as caspase activators presently in pre clinical research

in connection with the lease  sonus was required to provide a cash security deposit of approximately  which is included in other long term assets 
in addition  a standby letter of credit was issued in  and  was deposited in a restricted money market account as collateral 
we are currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space and have recorded a liability in the excess facilities lease charge of  as at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further details on our lease arrangements 
if we are unable to exit or sublet portions of this leased space  the future minimum annual lease payments are as follows in thousands remainder total consolidated rent payments relating to both the vancouver  canada and bothell  washington office space for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
guarantees and indemnifications we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is equal to the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we have obtained director and officer insurance that limits our exposure and may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe that the fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
accordingly  we have not recognized any liabilities relating to these obligations as of december  we have certain agreements with certain organizations with which we do business that contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we typically agree to indemnify the party against certain types of third party claims 
we accrue for known indemnification issues when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
there were no accruals for or expenses related to indemnification issues for any period presented 
material changes in financial condition in thousands december  december  total assets total liabilities total equity the increase in assets from december  to december  primarily relates to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities following the october public offering  offset by costs incurred in relation to the custirsen clinical development plan 
the reduction in liabilities from december  relates to milestone payments made to isis and ubc in resulting from our collaboration agreement with teva  and lower deferred collaboration revenue reflecting our contribution to the custirsen clinical development plan in the increase in equity relates primarily to the issuance of shares through the public offering of our common stock in october 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions principally relate to the performance period of our deliverables under our collaboration agreement with teva  estimates of the fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants  the resolution of uncertain tax positions and estimates of the fair value of our excess lease facility liability 
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  which we consider as available for sale and are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
short term investments short term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year 
we consider our short term investments as available for sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity deficiency 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss 
the cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
other financial instruments including amounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are carried at cost  which we believe approximates fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments 
intellectual property the costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development process  including licensing fees and milestone payments  are charged to research and development expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an alternative future use for the acquired rights  and are capitalized in situations where we have identified an alternative future use 
no costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized to date 
costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront payment we received in the fourth quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement with teva  as well as cash reimbursements from teva for certain costs incurred by us under the clinical development plan 
under the collaboration agreement  we and teva share certain custirsen related development costs 
we are required to spend million in direct and indirect development costs  such as full time equivalent  reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the clinical development plan  such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided by teva as an advanced reimbursement for our r d expenses  or reimbursed to us on a cash basis 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
when we have fulfilled our requirement to spend million in direct and indirect development costs  including full time equivalents  teva will  on a quarterly basis  reimburse all development expenses incurred in accordance with the clinical development plan 
our policy is to account for these reimbursements as collaboration revenue 

table of contents for a description of the collaboration agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the collaboration agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables  and requires evaluation pursuant to asc  multiple element arrangements  or asc we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether we had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that we had multiple deliverables under the collaboration agreement  including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services in the united states and canada  and estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the fourth quarter of because we were able to establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the maintenance  regulatory  and clinical services  we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under asc in establishing vsoe for the manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services  our management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services 
we will recognize million allocated to the manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue over the estimated performance period  using the proportional performance model  of which million has been recognized to date 
estimation of the performance period of our deliverables required management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are not limited to  our experience  along with teva s experience  in conducting clinical development activities 
we will review the estimated duration of our performance period on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in estimates of the performance period may materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement 
because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license  it used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize 
based on this approach  we recognized million in relating to this element 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us 
management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments  and that the milestone payments  once received  relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
under the collaboration agreement  we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of custirsen ranging from the mid teens to the mid twenties 
we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense on assets acquired under capital lease is recorded within depreciation expense 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the following periods computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years leasehold improvements over the term of the lease reporting currency and foreign currency translation effective august   we changed our functional currency from the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
our primary economic environment changed from canada to the united states following the acquisition of sonus 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further details on the arrangement 
this resulted in significant changes in economic facts and circumstances that indicated that the functional currency had changed 
we accounted for the change in functional currency prospectively 
our consolidated financial statements for the period of january  to august   which are based on the canadian functional currency  has been translated into the us reporting currency using the current rate method as required by asc  foreign currency matters  or asc  as follows assets and liabilities using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date  stockholders equity using the applicable historic rate  and revenue and expenses using the monthly average rate of exchange 
translation adjustments have been included as part of the accumulated other comprehensive income 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
scientific research and development tax credits the benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided there is reasonable assurance of recoverability 
the tax credits recorded are based on management s estimates of amounts expected to be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities 
the refundable tax credit reduces the carrying cost of expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates 
the non refundable tax credit reduces the tax provision 
following the completion of the arrangement  all qualifying expenditures are eligible for non refundable tax credits only 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on the arrangement 
therapeutic discovery research grants the internal revenue service s therapeutic discovery tax credit program  created under the patient protection and affordable care act of provides tax credits or grants representing up to of eligible qualified investments in therapeutic discovery projects during tax years and we applied for and received funds under this program to support our custirsen and ogx development projects 
the benefits of research grants under the internal revenue service s therapeutic discovery tax credit program are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is approved  provided that there is reasonable assurance of recoverability 
the tax grants recorded are based on management s estimates of amounts expected to be received and are subject to audit by taxation authorities 
the research grants reduce the carrying cost of expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates 

table of contents r d expenses r d expenses are expensed as incurred  net of related refundable investment tax credits  with the exception of non refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development  which are capitalized in accordance with asc  research and development  and are included in prepaid expenses 
clinical trial expenses are a component of r d expenses 
these expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers  which conduct certain product development activities on our behalf 
we use an accrual basis of accounting  based on estimates of the amount of service completed 
in the event payments differ from the amount of service completed  prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance sheet 
these expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
we monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the asc  stock compensation  using the modified prospective method with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after january  and for all awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  the expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the graded vesting period 
segment information we follow the requirements of asc  segment reporting 
we have one operating segment  dedicated to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies  with operations located in canada and the united states 
comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss 
other comprehensive income loss consists of translation adjustments from the application of us dollar reporting until august  and unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale marketable securities 
we have reported the components of comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity 
loss per common share basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted to reflect the equivalent oncogenex pharmaceuticals shares and equity structure 
prior to the completion of the arrangement on august   the weighted average number of common shares represents oncogenex technologies only 
diluted loss per common share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method  which uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
the effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding stock options  convertible preferred shares  and debentures is anti dilutive for all periods presented 
warrants we account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
the computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on revaluation of warrants 

table of contents reclassifications certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the expenses associated with adjustments to sublease income assumptions relating to our bothell facility were reclassified during the third quarter of from research and development expenses to restructuring expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our lease arrangements 
this reclassification on the statements of loss was made in all prior periods presented for comparability purposes 
this reclassification had no effect on net loss  stockholders equity  total assets and total liabilities  or the major categories of the cash flow statement 
recently adopted accounting policies in january  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements  amends disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain level activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted this amendment in the quarter ended march   except for the additional level requirements  which will be adopted in recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this standard provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for certain research and development transactions 
under this new standard  a company can recognize as revenue consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in the period in which it is achieved  only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
this standard will be effective for us on a prospective basis for periods beginning after january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars  and our exposure to interest rate changes is monitored 
we have very limited interest rate risk due to the few assets or liabilities subject to fluctuations in interests rates 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
due to the nature of our highly liquid marketable securities  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and payroll expenses related to our canadian subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  denominated in canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts 
as our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuate  our earnings might be negatively affected 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period 
we have estimated the effect on our reported results of operations of a hypothetical increase of percent in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar to be  for the year ended december
