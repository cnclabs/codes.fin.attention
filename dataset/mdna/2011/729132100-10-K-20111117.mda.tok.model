executive summary fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  from fiscal year to  million 
net sales increased in all of our market sectors during fiscal  except for a decrease in the wireless infrastructure sector 
the overall higher net sales were from both new and existing customers  such as the ramp of production for our newer industrial commercial sector customer  as well as an increase in net sales to juniper networks  inc juniper  our largest customer  as a result of improved end market demand for the mix of juniper products we produce as well as new product launches 
we also experienced strong demand from a medical customer and a defense security aerospace customer during the year as a result of increased end market demand for the products they produce 
these increases were partially offset by decreased net sales to two significant customers  one in the wireline networking sector and one in the wireless infrastructure sector  related to previously announced disengagements as a result of acquisitions  and decreased sales from one additional wireless infrastructure customer as a result of a drop in end market demand for the mix of its products that we produce 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared unfavorably to percent for fiscal gross margins in fiscal were lower as a result changes in our customer mix  higher fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth and increased depreciation expense 
the prior year also included proceeds from a litigation settlement see note 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal the majority of the increase was due to higher employee compensation and relocation expense as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth as well as higher stock based compensation expense 
this was partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation in fiscal as 
table of contents compared to fiscal selling and administrative expenses were percent of sales for fiscal  as compared to percent in fiscal other expense for fiscal decreased slightly from  driven primarily by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation  partially offset by increased interest expense 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net income decreased slightly from the prior year period due to changes in customer mix and higher fixed and selling and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased sales 
diluted earnings per share increased from the prior year period due to lower average shares outstanding related to our share repurchase program 
the effective tax rate in the current year period was approximately percent  which compares unfavorably to the percent tax rate in the prior year period primarily due to the mix of the company s fiscal pre tax income 
fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  from fiscal year to  million 
net sales increased in all of our market sectors during fiscal  except for a slight decrease in the defense security aerospace sector 
the overall higher net sales were driven primarily by stronger end market conditions  as well as the ramp of production for new customer programs in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial  and medical sectors 
these increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from two defense security aerospace sector customers  as well as decreased net sales to juniper 
net sales to juniper declined slightly as a result of decreased end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared favorably to percent for fiscal gross margins in fiscal were higher due to the increased net sales  changes in customer mix and proceeds from a litigation settlement see note  partially offset by increases in variable incentive compensation expense due to strong financial performance as well as fixed expenses as a result of higher headcount 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal sixty percent of the increase was due to higher variable incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remainder of the increase was driven primarily by increased employee compensation expense as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth 
for fiscal  the company did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges as compared to charges of million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared favorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net income increased from fiscal due to overall increased sales and higher gross margins and the absence of restructuring charges  offset by increased fixed expenses and selling and administrative expenses 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was percent  which compares unfavorably to the percent tax benefit in fiscal the increase in effective tax rate from fiscal was primarily due to the mix of the company s fiscal pre tax income and the absence in of a net million tax benefit resulting from a discrete event that occurred in fiscal other 
the effective income tax rates benefits for fiscal  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the mix of the company s fiscal pre tax income and the absence in of a net million tax benefit resulting from a discrete event that occurred in fiscal the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to changes in the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate

results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase decrease october  october  increase decrease net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors  except for a decrease in the wireless infrastructure sector 
the net sales increase primarily related to the ramp of production for a newer industrial commercial sector customer 
net sales to juniper increased as a result of improved end market demand for the mix of juniper products we produce as well as new product launches 
overall  we had net sales increases spread across new and existing customers in both the industrial commercial and medical sectors during fiscal  which were partially offset by the two previously announced disengagements as a result of acquisitions with one each in the wireline networking and the wireless infrastructure market sectors  as well as decreased sales from one additional wireless infrastructure customer as a result of a drop in end market demand for the mix of its products that we produce 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors  except for the defense security aerospace sector 
the overall higher net sales were driven primarily by strong end market conditions  as well as the addition of new customers in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial and medical sectors 
these net sales increases were offset in part by decreased net sales to two defense security aerospace customers  as well as lower net sales to juniper as a result of a decline in end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
our net sales percentages by market sector for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  october  october  wireline networking wireless infrastructure medical industrial commercial defense security aerospace 
table of contents the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended october  october  october  juniper top customers net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements  terminations  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration with our top customers remained at or above percent during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end market demand and other factors  including global economic conditions 
any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors  we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector 
in the current economic environment  we are seeing increased merger and acquisition activity that has impacted our customers 
specifically  we previously announced that two of our customers were acquired in the first quarter of fiscal the customer in the wireline networking sector began to reduce orders to us at the end of fiscal and substantially disengaged in fiscal the customer in the wireless infrastructure sector began disengagement in fiscal and also substantially disengaged in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase decrease october  october  increase decrease gross profit gross margin for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in all of our market sectors except wireless infrastructure  driven by demand from new and existing customers across the majority of our market sectors  partially offset by unfavorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately million of the net increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase in fixed manufacturing costs due to increased headcount expenses to support revenue growth of approximately million 
fixed costs also grew as a percentage of sales as a result of expansion in our apac and emea regions as they ramp to capacity  as well as the underutilization of two amer facilities  due to the disengagement of a significant customer and the slower ramp of a significant customer increased depreciation expense of million due to the expansions mentioned above  and the effect of the non recurrence of a million benefit in the first quarter of fiscal from a litigation settlement 
for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in all of our reportable segments  driven by strong end market conditions  as well as the addition of new customers in the wireless infrastructure  wireline networking  industrial commercial and medical sectors  as well as favorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately million of the increase in gross profit 
table of contents increased capacity utilization from the higher revenue levels proceeds of million received from a litigation settlement  which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales  and partially offset by increased variable compensation expense of approximately million as a result of improved financial performance and fixed expenses  primarily in the amer and apac reportable segments  due to increased headcount to support the revenue growth 
design work performed by the company is not the proprietary property of plexus and substantially all costs incurred with this work are considered reimbursable by our customers 
we do not track research and development costs that are not reimbursed by our customers and we consider these amounts immaterial 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase decrease october  october  increase decrease s a percent of net sales for fiscal  the increase in s a expenses was due to increased employee compensation and relocation expense of approximately million as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth  as well as higher stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
this was partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal of approximately million 
s a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal as a result of net sales expanding more quickly than these cost increases 
for fiscal  sixty percent of the increase in s a expenses was due to higher variable incentive compensation expense as a result of strong financial performance 
the remainder of the increase was driven primarily by an increase in headcount to support our revenue growth 
s a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal as a result of net sales expanding more quickly than these cost increases 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
for both fiscal and fiscal  we did not incur any restructuring or asset impairment charges 
our restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  october  goodwill impairment severance costs adjustments to lease exit costs other total restructuring and asset impairment charges the restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal were associated with various reportable segments 
management excludes such charges when analyzing the performance of the reportable segments

table of contents other income expense 
other income expense for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance october  october  increase decrease october  october  increase decrease other income expense percent of net sales other income expense for fiscal decreased million  to million of expense from million of expense in fiscal this change was driven by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments of million  partially offset by increased interest expense of million  primarily related to our private placement debt  which we entered into during the third quarter of fiscal as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
other income expense for fiscal increased million  to million of expense from million of expense in fiscal this change was driven by the unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments of million and reduced interest income of million due to lower effective interest rates  partially offset by decreased interest expense of million  primarily related to servicing the million term loan drawn in april income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended october  october  october  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate benefit the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to change in mix in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
as a result of using the with and without method under the requirements for accounting for stock based compensation  the company recorded a valuation allowance for federal and state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable 
as of the end of fiscal there was a valuation allowance of million for federal and state taxes against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options 
during fiscal the company recorded an additional valuation allowance million 
as a result  we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of october  during the preparation of the company s fiscal consolidated financial statements  the company performed an analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  consistent with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes 
the company s us operations generated losses during the fiscal  and years 
while we believe these losses could be a significant factor in establishing such an allowance  we believe that based on the weight of all the evidence  both positive and negative  it is more likely than not that the company will be able to utilize its us net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
see note income taxes for further details 

table of contents in addition  there was a remaining valuation allowance of million as of october   related to various state deferred income tax assets for which utilization was uncertain due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in those states 
there was no change in the valuation allowance during fiscal if the us operations continue to generate losses  there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets  which totaled million as of october  during fiscal the company added a valuation allowance of million and million in the united kingdom and romania  respectively  to offset the increase in net deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions which more likely than not will not be realized 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately to percent 
the rate increase is due mainly to the increase in projected income in the united states and lower projected income in low tax malaysia and china jurisdictions 
the company has been granted tax holidays for its malaysian and xiamen  china subsidiaries 
these tax holidays expire in and  respectively  and are subject to certain conditions with which the company expects to comply 
in fiscal  and  these subsidiaries generated income  which resulted in tax reductions of approximately million per basic share  million per basic share and million per basic share  respectively 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  our net income decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by percent due to the effects of our fiscal stock repurchases 
net income increased by million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal  diluted earnings per share increased percent 
reportable segments in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our migration to a regional reporting structure  and as a result  modified our reportable segments

net sales to juniper also increased as a result 
table of contents of improved end market demand for the mix of juniper products we produce in the region as well as new product launches 
these increases were offset by reduced net sales to two significant wireless infrastructure customers  one as a result of a previously announced disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer 
operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal due to the prior year period benefitting from a million litigation settlement  as well as changes in customer mix in the current year 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this increase reflected higher end market demand from numerous existing customers in each of our market sectors and the ramp of production for new customers in the wireline networking  wireless infrastructure  industrial commercial and medical sectors 
these increases were partially offset by reduced net sales to our largest customer  juniper  due to the transfer of manufacturing of some products to our apac reportable segment  as well as decreased end market demand for the mix of juniper products produced by us 
operating income for fiscal increased million from fiscal primarily as a result of higher revenues from the customers noted above  improved operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels and proceeds received from a litigation settlement 
asia pacific apac net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal this growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors as well as increased demand from a new customer in the industrial commercial sector 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the wireline networking sector as well as a drop in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for a wireless infrastructure customer

operating income improved million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the net sales growth and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
europe  middle east and africa emea net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the change in net sales was driven by higher demand from two existing customer programs as well as the ramp of production for two new customers 
operating results were lower in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased operating costs from our romania facility and our new engineering facility in darmstadt  germany 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the change in net sales can be attributed to higher demand from the ramp of production for two existing customer programs in the industrial commercial sector 
operating results were lower in the current year as compared to the prior year due to operating costs from our new romania facility 
for our significant customers  we generally manufacture products in more than one location 
for example  sales to juniper occur in amer and apac 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments  including a detail of net sales by reportable segment 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of improvements in working capital 
inventory decreased by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory turns increased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal days in inventory changed favorably as of october  to days as compared to days at october  the decrease in inventory  both in dollars and days of cash cycle  
table of contents was the result of our efforts to actively manage our inventory levels down with the assistance of our customers  while continuing to meet our customers needs for flexibility and agility 
as part of our continued efforts to mitigate inventory risk  we have collected approximately million in cash deposits from our customers  which are classified as customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets  and have also continued to work with customers that have excess inventory issues in accordance with contractual obligations 
the overall decrease in accounts receivable of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly due to two customers  one in each of the industrial commercial and the wireline networking sectors  prepaying their respective accounts in fiscal our annualized days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for fiscal decreased favorably from days in fiscal to days in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal the primary investments included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  mainly in our apac region  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
investments were for new equipment to support customer demand in all of our regions as well as investments in new facilities in penang  malaysia and xiamen  china to increase capacity 
we expect our fourth penang  malaysia facility to be operational in our first quarter of fiscal and our second xiamen  china facility to be operational in the second half of fiscal see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our capital expenditures by reportable segment 
fiscal purchases of property  plant and equipment included million  million  and million related to our apac  amer  and emea reportable segments  respectively 
we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the principal sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal we currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million 
a significant portion of the fiscal capital expenditures is anticipated to be used for the completion of the two facilities mentioned above penang  malaysia and xiamen  china 
we also anticipate announcing  during the first half of fiscal  the construction of a larger facility in oradea  romania to replace leased buildings that served as our start up solution in lower cost europe 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled million for fiscal  primarily due to purchases of common stock related to our stock repurchase program as well as payments on our term note and capital leases  offset by proceeds from our private placement debt issuance and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on february  the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common stock 
on august   the company completed its share repurchase program with a total of million shares purchased at a volume weighted average of per share 
the company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal to support our new share repurchase program  we entered into a note purchase agreement the agreement for million in principal amount of senior notes  due june  the notes during the third quarter of fiscal we issued million in principal amount of the notes on april   and the remaining million on june  the agreement includes operational and financial covenants which include a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens and dispositions  all as defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
origination fees and expenses associated with the private placement totaled approximately million and have been deferred 
these origination fees and expenses are being amortized over the seven year term of the notes 
semi annual interest payments began on june  and end on june  with full repayment of the total principal of the notes 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into two separate treasury rate lock hedge contracts to hedge the variability of the fixed interest rate on the then forecasted issuance of million of fixed rate debt using a treasury lock transaction 
the fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are and  respectively  with a notional value of million 
on april   we entered into a final treasury rate lock hedge transaction for the remaining million of exposure at a rate of 
on april   when the fixed interest rate for the debt issuance was determined  all three treasury rate lock contracts were settled and we received proceeds of million  which is being amortized over the seven year term of the related debt 
on april   we entered into our credit agreement the credit facility with a group of banks which allows us to borrow million in term loans and million in revolving loans 
the million in term loans was immediately funded and the million revolving credit facility is currently available 
the credit facility is unsecured and may be increased by an additional million to a total of million the accordion feature 
this is possible if we have not previously terminated all or any portion of the credit facility  there is no event of default 
table of contents existing under the credit agreement and both we and the administrative agent consent to the increase 
the credit facility expires on april  borrowings under the credit facility may be either through term loans or revolving or swing loans or letter of credit obligations

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test  all as defined in the agreement 
as of october   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
if we incur an event of default  as defined in the credit facility including any failure to comply with a financial covenant  the group of banks has the right to terminate the credit facility and all other obligations  and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding sums principal and accrued interest 
the interest rate on the borrowing varies depending upon our then current total leverage ratio  as of october   the company could elect to pay interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus 
rates would increase upon negative changes in specified company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio to no less than libor plus 
we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused credit commitment based on our leverage ratio  the current fee is 
unless the accordion feature is exercised  this fee applies only to the initial million of availability excluding the million of term borrowings 
origination fees and expenses associated with the credit facility totaled approximately million and have been deferred 
these origination fees and expenses will be amortized over the five year term of the credit facility 
quarterly principal repayments on the term loan of million each began june   and end on april   with a final balloon repayment of million 
the credit facility allows for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default including any failure to comply with a financial covenant exists at the time of  or would be caused by  the dividend payment or the share repurchases 
additionally  the company enters interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives to hedge against variable cash flows 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity 
see note derivatives and fair value measurements for further details 
in february  the company negotiated the settlement of a capital lease in kelso  scotland 
the termination of this capital lease obligation and acquisition of the property was effected through a cash payment by plexus of million 
based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and short term investments  the credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months 
million of committed credit is currently available under the credit facility  with another million available in an accordion facility  which is contingent upon compliance with the credit agreement and lender approval 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  particularly due to the current instability of the credit and financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future 
however  the company evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash  which in the future may include share repurchases  a special dividend or recurring dividends

our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation the financial accounting standard board fasb requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
we used the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the fasb regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions  including future revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
intangible assets during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  related to the company s sole goodwill asset 
the impairment wrote off the entire carrying value of our goodwill related to our kelso facility  which was the sole reporting unit in the emea reportable segment 
the impairment charge was driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions that contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the company s offerings from the kelso facility 
these conditions led to an interim triggering event  leading management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
this test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of the goodwill relating to kelso was fully impaired and therefore an impairment charge of million was taken 
should we have goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in the future  we would test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less  are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model 
the completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist 
any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity 
see note derivatives and fair value measurements for further details 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
accordingly  the company does not currently provide for additional us and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could 
table of contents potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

if the us operations continue to generate losses  there may be a need to provide a valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets  which totaled million as of october  new accounting pronouncements see note in notes to consolidated financial statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
beginning in july  we entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our apac reportable segment and beginning in july  we entered into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in mexico  as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs the company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods presented above 
based on the company s overall currency exposure  as of october   a percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments as well as debt  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks based on existing market conditions 
we have entered into interest rate swaps for million in term loans  as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
as is common with these types of agreements  our interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk as of october   is associated with our credit facility under which we borrowed million 
through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on interest expense
