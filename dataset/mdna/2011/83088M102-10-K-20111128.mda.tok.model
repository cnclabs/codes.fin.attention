fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks and ended on september   october  and october   respectively 
effective october   we adopted asc debt  debt with conversion and other options asc in accordance with gaap 
our financial statements and the accompanying footnotes for all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of this new accounting principle 
net revenue and net income for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year ended september  have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from their respective acquisition dates 
sige semiconductor  inc sige contributed approximately million of net revenue to the consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  the impact of sige ongoing operations on the company net income was insignificant to the fiscal year ended september  the transaction related costs associated to the sige acquisition were considered immaterial and included within selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended september  results of operations fiscal years ended september   october   and october  the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal years below net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and other charges credits total operating expenses operating income interest expense loss gain on early retirement of convertible debt other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income 
table of contents general during fiscal year  certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations 
more specifically smart phones are entering the stage of mass market adoption and becoming a more integral part of consumers daily lives 
these devices increasingly incorporate mobile internet connectivity  social networking  portable gaming  digital cameras  high definition camcorders and mobile payment systems in addition to the functionality of traditional mobile phones 
this trend creates a higher dollar content per handset which results in an expanded market opportunity for skyworks devices 
our growing addressable market  coupled with increasing market share and strategic acquisitions made during the year are the primary drivers of the approximately revenue growth to billion in fiscal year gross profit increased by million or basis points to of net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal year the increase in gross profit in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenue is primarily the result of enhanced product mix  lower manufacturing costs as a result of higher factory utilization  and the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
operating income increased by million or over the prior year to of revenue for fiscal year the increase is primarily due to the aforementioned increases in net revenue and gross margin along with a higher degree of operating leverage as the company maintained relatively constant operating expenditures 
we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal year resulting in an ending cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of million at september  even after factoring in the use of million of cash for acquisitions  net of cash received  million of cash on capital expenditures and million of cash for shares repurchased 
in june  we acquired sige for million in total consideration 
sige is a leading global supplier of rf front end solutions that facilitate wireless multimedia across a wide range of applications 
the acquisition of sige complements the company s leadership in wide area front end solutions by adding sige innovative short range  silicon based products 
as a result  the company now offers customers a more comprehensive wireless networking product portfolio  supporting all key operating frequencies with greater architectural flexibility to address a variety of high growth applications 
sige contributed approximately to our revenue growth in fiscal year net revenue fiscal years ended september  change october  change october  dollars in thousands net revenue we market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers oems of communication electronic products  third party original design manufacturers odms  contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we periodically enter into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our non core patents or other intellectual property 
we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenue in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year this revenue increase was principally driven by an increase in our growing addressable market  coupled with increasing market share and the higher overall demand for our products used in mobile internet  wireless infrastructure  energy management and diversified analog applications 
in addition  we benefited from the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of sige during the fiscal year 
overall revenue in fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year this revenue increase was principally driven by market share gains and higher overall demand for our products used in mobile internet  wireless infrastructure  energy management and diversified analog devices

table of contents gross profit fiscal years ended september  change october  change october  dollars in thousands gross profit of net revenue gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and share based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
we increased our gross profit by million for the fiscal year ending september  as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a basis point expansion in gross profit margin to 
this increase was principally the result of enhanced product mix  lower manufacturing costs as a result of higher factory utilization  and the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
during fiscal we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
we increased our gross profit by million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a basis point expansion in gross profit margin to 
this was principally the result of continued factory process and productivity enhancements  product end to end yield improvements  year over year material cost reductions  targeted capital expenditure investments and the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
during fiscal we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
research and development fiscal years ended september  change october  change october  dollars in thousands research and development of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  masks and engineering prototypes  share based compensation expense and design and test tool costs 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to higher head count and related employee and share based compensation costs including those related to the sige acquisition 
in addition  we increased design activity and expense in support of increased product development for our target markets 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year as a result of the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to higher head count and related compensation costs

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses include legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  bad debt expense  sales commissions  share based compensation expense  advertising  marketing and other costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is principally due to the growth in the number of employees and related compensation expense including share based compensation  and to a lesser extent the increase related to professional fees associated with completed and pending acquisitions and a settlement of a contractual dispute 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the aforementioned increase in fiscal year revenue 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is principally due to share based compensation which increased primarily as a result of our increased stock price in fiscal year as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the aforementioned increase in fiscal year revenue 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal years ended september  change october  change october  dollars in thousands amortization of net revenue the increase in amortization expense for the fiscal year is related to the acquired intangible assets during the year which are primarily due to the acquisition of sige

provision benefit for income taxes fiscal years ended september  change october  change october  dollars in thousands provision benefit for income taxes of net revenue income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal year the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to a tax rate of for fiscal year as a result of the united states government enactment of the tax relief act of which retroactively reinstated and extended the research and development tax credit  million of federal research and development tax credits which were earned in fiscal year reduced our tax rate during the year ended september  the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a less than the united states federal rate  benefits of related to the research and development tax credits and benefits of related to a domestic production activities deduction partially offset by income tax expense of related to a change in our tax reserves 
on october   we expanded our presence in asia by launching operations in singapore 
we operate under a tax holiday in singapore  which is effective through september  the tax holiday is conditional upon our compliance in meeting certain employment and investment thresholds in singapore 
income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to benefit of million for fiscal year the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to a tax benefit of for fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a less than the united states federal rate  benefits of related to the research 
table of contents and development tax credits  benefits of related to an international restructuring to a lower tax jurisdiction and benefits of related to a domestic production activities deduction partially offset by income tax expense of and related to changes in our tax reserves and valuation allowance  respectively 
during fiscal year  we restructured our international operations resulting in a tax benefit of million 
this consisted of a tax benefit of million due to reassessing the united states income tax required to be recorded on earnings of our operations in mexico  offset by million of tax provision related to the transfer of assets to an affiliated foreign company 
as a result of this restructuring  we are no longer required to assess united states income tax on the earnings of our mexican business 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands september  october  october  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period does not include restricted cash balances cash flow from operating activities cash provided from operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
for fiscal year we generated million in cash flow from operations  an increase of million when compared to million generated in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the increase in net income of million for fiscal year  and the increase in non cash expenses such as depreciation of million  share based compensation of million  amortization of intangibles of million  offset by the change in net working capital 
cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities consists of cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and capital expenditures 
we had net cash outflows of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase resulted from cash paid for acquisitions of million net of cash received  primarily for sige and million in capital expenditures during the year 
cash flow from financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash transactions related to debt and equity 
during fiscal year  we had net cash outflows of million  compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year we had the following significant uses of cash million related to our repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on august   million related to the repayment and termination of the credit facility  and million related to payroll tax withholdings on the vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million  tax benefit from stock option exercises of million and a decrease in restricted cash of million during fiscal liquidity cash and cash equivalent balances excluding restricted cash decreased million to million at september  from million at october  this decrease was primarily due to the million in cash paid for acquisitions  million in capital expenditures and million for share repurchases during the year offset by our cash provided by operations of million 
our net cash position  after deducting our debt  increased by million to million at september  from million at october  on may   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire all the outstanding shares of aati for per share in a combination of cash and stock 
in the event that the company stock price is below per share on the date of acquisition and elects an all cash transaction  the company expects to pay approximately million and million net of approximately million to million of cash expected to be received in the transaction 
based on our historical results of operations  we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with 
table of contents cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations including the cash premium  contingent consideration for our completed acquisitions  pending and future acquisitions  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make may require additional capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our invested cash balances primarily consist of money market funds where the underlying securities primarily consist of united states treasury obligations  united states agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by united states government and agency obligations 
our invested cash balances also include time deposits and certificates of deposit 
at september   we also held a million par value auction rate security with a fair value of million on which we continue to receive the scheduled interest payments 
we continue to monitor the liquidity and accounting classification of this security 
if in a future period we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we will impair the security to its fair value and charge the loss to earnings 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulation s k a ii 
contractual cash flows following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations related to our consolidated debt  contingent consideration  operating leases  other commitments and long term liabilities at september  see notes and of item of this annual report on form k  in thousands payments due by period obligation total less than year years years thereafter short term debt obligations cash premium on convertible notes due march other commitments operating lease obligations contingent consideration for business combinations other long term liabilities total cash premiums related to the if converted value of the convertible notes that exceed aggregate principal balance using the closing stock price of on september  the actual amount of the cash premium will be calculated based on the day average stock price prior to maturity

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  business combinations  valuation of long lived assets  share based compensation  income taxes  goodwill and intangibles  and loss contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported  disclosures  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our best judgments 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of item in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition net of estimated reserves 
we maintain revenue reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection stock rotation for certain electronic component distributors 
these reserves are based on historical experience or specific identification of a contractual arrangement necessitating a revenue reserve 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for product returns  price protection and stock rotation 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to record revenue reserves during the last three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts that we estimate will arise from customers inability to make required payments against amounts owed on credit sales 
the reserve is based on the analysis of credit risk and aged receivable balances 
our allowance for doubtful accounts methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to apply judgment to evaluate credit risk and collectability of aged accounts receivables based on historical experience and forward looking assumptions 
there have been no material changes in our accounting methodology used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year 
the process by which we evaluate customer creditworthiness was modified in fiscal year for purposes of establishing our allowance 
this did not have a material effect on our balance 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to earnings 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
our reserve is based on a detailed analysis of forecasted demand in relation to on hand inventory  salability of our inventory  general market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventory reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we have not made any material changes to our inventory reserve methodology during the last three fiscal years 
we do not believe that significant changes will be made in future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these reserves 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate or changes in technology affect consumer demand we may be exposed to unforeseen gains or losses 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of september  would affect fiscal year earnings by approximately million 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions business combinations the company has applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired  liabilities assumed  goodwill recognized and the contingent consideration recorded as part of business combinations 
the value of the assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in measuring the fair value  the company utilizes valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation such as  projected revenue  royalty rates  weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  estimated useful lives  etc 
these assessments can be significantly affected by management judgments 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be material changes to our estimates or assumptions 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our evaluation or assumptions  additional and or new information arises in the future that affects the fair value estimates could result in adjustments that may have a material impact to the purchase accounting or results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the assets to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group  we would recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate asset fair values  including estimating future cash flows  useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may incur material losses 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan which includes non qualified stock options  share awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
see note of item of this annual report on form k for a detailed listing and complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified share based compensation at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant contains assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  risk free rate  and the expected life 
the black scholes value  combined with our estimated forfeiture rate  is used to determine the compensation expense to be recognized over the life of the options 
for performance based awards  we determine the fair value based on the grant date value of the company stock 
these awards are expensed based on an estimate of the most probably outcome of the underlying performance metric 
management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates stock based compensation expense accordingly 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and stock based compensation recognized by the company 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to calculate share based compensation during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to a material change in share based compensation expense 
a difference in our share based compensation expense for the year ended september  would affect fiscal year earnings by approximately million 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainties 
estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a material loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to assess the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess loss contingencies in the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be material changes to our estimates or assumptions 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our evaluation or assumptions  there could be a material impact to earnings 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
asc income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods and disclosure 
the application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations  and court rulings 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we feel is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits of the position  to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we feel are more likely than not to not be realized 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities or reserves for additional income tax liabilities 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  or events cause us to change our estimate of probable additional income tax liability  a further charge to expense would be required 
the company expects to continue to be profitable and therefore has determined that a valuation allowance is not required against our deferred tax assets  except for certain state and foreign tax credits 
if certain events cause us to change our estimate of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  a further charge to expense would be required 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangibles may not be recoverable 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise an insignificant portion of the total book value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
pursuant to the guidance provide under asc segment reporting  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating and testing goodwill 
the impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we use the market price of the company s stock adjusted for a market premium to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the possible goodwill impairment loss 
in the second step  we would use a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would then be compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we would recognize a loss equal to the excess 
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate control premiums  discount rate  future cash flows and the profitability of future business strategies 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at september  were million and million  respectively 
based on the results of our impairment test  we had a significant excess fair value over the carrying value 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
other matters inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to investment risk  interest rate risk  and foreign exchange rate risk as described below 
investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio  which as of september  consisted of the following in thousands cash and cash equivalents time deposits and money market funds restricted cash time deposits and certificates of deposit available for sale securities auction rate securities the main objective of our investment activities is the liquidity and preservation of capital 
in general  our cash and cash equivalent investments have short term maturity periods which dampen the impact of significant market or interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with our investments is not material as our investment policy prescribes high credit quality standards and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading  speculative or investment purposes  however  we may use derivatives in the future 

table of contents we are subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality and interest rates 
available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period contractual maturities exceed ten years 
our short term debt at september  consists of million aggregate principal amount of our remaining convertible notes which are due in march the convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions should the share price of the company s common stock exceed 
it has been the company s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments  and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future 
as of september   based on the closing stock price on september  of  the actual if converted value of the remaining convertible notes was million which exceeds the related principal amount by approximately million 
the actual amount of the cash premium will be calculated based on the day average stock price prior to maturity 
a change in our stock price would change the if converted value of the cash premium of the total aggregate principle amount of the remaining convertible notes by approximately million 
we do not believe that investment or interest rate risk is material to our business or results of operations 
our cash and cash equivalents at september  consisted of million held domestically  with the remaining balance of million held by foreign subsidiaries 
there may be adverse tax effects upon repatriation of these funds to the united states 
exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended september   october   and october   the company had foreign exchange gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
