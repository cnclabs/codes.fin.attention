bancorp also provides atms  debit cards  internet banking including on line bill pay  mortgage lending  safe deposit boxes  and telephone banking  among other products and services 
bancorp has experienced improved earnings from those experienced during the second half of and all of as it continues to see some improvement in the national and local economic environment 
management believes that bancorp s results  while significantly better than  does not mean that it will not continue to experience the challenges it and many other financial institutions faced in and as a result of the economic recession 
those challenges  including increased loan delinquencies and a decrease in the demand for certain loan products including construction  development  and land acquisition loans  continue to show signs of improvement from and however  continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the recession  including job losses and other factors  have continued to affect bancorp s borrowers 
management believes that this economic deterioration has stabilized somewhat in which has resulted in stabilization in loan delinquencies and impaired loans from levels 
while the interest rate spread between bancorp s cost of funds and what it earns on loans has increased from levels  competition for new loans and deposits remains strong 
the increase in interest rate spread was caused in part by decreases in non accrual loans in which interest income was not recorded  and to decreases in interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings outpacing the decreases in interest earned on loans 
bancorp s total loan portfolio has decreased from and bancorp has experienced a modest decrease in loan delinquencies  which resulted in the allowance for loan losses to decrease from bancorp has seen an increase in foreclosed real estate expenses as a result of more loans going to foreclosure 
the increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher foreclosed real estate expenses 
bancorp expects to experience continued improvement in market conditions in  as the effects of the recession continue to improve and as the employment environment in its market improves 
however  if interest rates increase  demand for borrowing may remain low and bancorp s interest rate spread could decrease 
the bancorp will continue to manage loan and deposit pricing against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans and deposits  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead 
if the volatility in the market and the economy continues or worsens  our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to funds and the price of our stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
on november   bancorp and the bank each entered into a supervisory agreement with the ots which primarily addressed the issues identified in the ots reports of examination of bancorp s and the bank s operations and financial condition in see item business supervisory agreements for more information 
critical accounting policies bancorp s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
of these significant accounting policies  bancorp considers the policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate to be its most critical accounting policies  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on real estate values of underlying collateral affecting the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate 
bancorp has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
bancorp s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  the following discusses the material changes between the december  and statements of financial condition

home equity lines of credit decreased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this decrease was primarily due to less customer demand for home equity loans in as a result of the economic recession 
home equity lines of credit allow the borrowers to draw funds up to a specified loan amount  from time to time 
bancorp s management believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to have the funding available as these borrowers draw on these loans 
loan commitments increased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this increase was primarily due to the timing of loan commitments booked at year end 
loan commitments are obligations of bancorp to provide loans  and such commitments are made in the usual course of business

loans sold and serviced with limited repurchase provisions increased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this increase was the result of a higher volume of loans sold in the secondary market in as management increased its focus in this area 
bancorp uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for its on balance sheet instruments 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
bancorp s net income for the year ended december  was  or a loss of per share diluted after giving effect to dividends paid on preferred stock and amortization of discount on preferred stock 
this is compared to net loss of  or a loss of per share diluted in this increase of  was primarily the result of the improved economic environment bancorp experienced in compared to  including an increase in net interest income  a decrease in the provision for loan losses and a decrease in non accrual loans 
net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in bancorp s interest rate spread 
bancorp s interest rate spread increased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase was the result of interest rates earned on bancorp s loan portfolio decreasing slower than the decrease in interest rates paid on bancorp s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  bancorp s non accrual loans decreased from  at december  to  at december  this resulted in  of interest income not recorded on non accrual loans in  compared to  of unrecorded interest in bancorp discontinues the accrual of interest on all non accrual loans  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
bancorp is uncertain whether it will be able to further reduce the interest rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities by attracting lower cost deposits  due to the general expectation of continued increased competition for deposit accounts 
provision for loan losses 
bancorp s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly 
all loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the bank s portfolio as a group are evaluated 
the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s loss mitigation committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors as historical losses for each loan portfolio  current market value of the loan s underlying collateral  inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
an increase in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the year to the end of a year is the result after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
the total allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to  as of december   compared to  as of december  management s decision to decrease the allowance was due to a decrease in loans receivable  an improvement in loan delinquencies and a reduction in impaired loans primarily due to foreclosed loans transferred to foreclosed real estate 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease of  or  was a result of management s determination that less of a provision for loan losses was needed for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  bancorp s total loan portfolio has decreased from in addition  bancorp has experienced a modest decrease in loan delinquencies  which contributed to the decision to reduce the provision for loan losses from management believes that bancorp will continue to experience improvement in the challenges faced by many financial institutions resulting from the slowdown in the economy and real estate markets  including increased loan delinquencies 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses and other factors  have adversely affected bancorp s borrowers 
other income and non interest expenses 
total other income increased  or  to  for compared to  for revenues from mortgage banking activities increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of the management s increased focus on originating loans to be sold in the secondary market

total non interest expense increased  or  to  for compared to  for compensation and related expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the hiring of higher level management personnel in and the resulting higher compensation for these employees in compared to as of december   bancorp had full time equivalent employees compared to at december  occupancy expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher maintenance costs incurred at bancorp s headquarters 
foreclosed real estate expenses  net increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in loans foreclosed on  higher write downs taken on foreclosed property and expenses associated with the maintenance of foreclosed property in compared to legal fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in fees associated with loan foreclosures and loan collections in compared to the fdic assessment increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of increased premiums charged by the fdic in for the change in the maximum amount of fdic deposit insurance from  per account to  per account  and to replenish the fdic for an increased number of bank failures in and other non interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a an increase in advertising  accounting  credit reports  contributions  dues and subscriptions  office expense  property management fees  postage  on line charges and telephone partially offset by bank service charges and savings account losses

net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bancorp s interest rate spread and to a decrease in its loan portfolio 
bancorp s interest rate spread decreased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of interest rates earned on bancorp s loan portfolio decreasing faster than the decrease in interest rates paid on bancorp s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  bancorp s non accrual loans increased from  at december  to  at december  bancorp discontinues the accrual of interest on all non accrual loans  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
this resulted in  of interest income not recorded on these loans 
provision for loan losses

during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was a result of an increase in loan delinquencies  increased charge offs  and management s determination that adding to the provision for loan losses was appropriate for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as compared to the year ended december  other income and non interest expenses 
revenues from mortgage banking activities decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of the continued slowdown in loan demand in partially offset by management s increased focus on attracting loans to be sold in the secondary market 
real estate commissions decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in commercial sales and leasing in compared to real estate management fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased fees charged in other non interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher credit report fees  partially offset by lower letter of credit fees

foreclosed real estate expenses  net increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in foreclosed real estate  write downs taken on foreclosed property and expenses associated with the maintaining foreclosed property 
legal fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in fees associated with loan foreclosures and collections

income taxes decreased  to an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in  bancorp s sources of liquidity were loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  and the sale of loans 
bancorp considers core deposits stable funding sources and includes all deposits  except time deposits of  or more 
at december   core deposits equaled of total deposits 
the bank s experience has been that a substantial portion of certificates of deposit renew at time of maturity and remain on deposit with the bank 
additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contributed to bancorp s flow of funds 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds  which may be drawn upon when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit with the fhlb atlanta 
the bank s credit availability under the fhlb of atlanta s credit availability program was  at december   of which  was outstanding 
the bank is able to borrow up to of total assets 
the maturities of these long term advances at december  were as follows dollars in thousands rate amount maturity to to to thereafter as of december   bancorp had outstanding an aggregate of  principal amount of subordinated debt  consisting of the debentures and the subordinated notes 
the debentures total  pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of interest of month libor december  plus basis points  and mature on january  the subordinated notes total  and pay interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of march  june  september and december commencing december  the subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of bancorp at any time beginning on december  until maturity  which is december  as of december   bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  and unadvanced construction commitments of  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above 
these amounts do not include undisbursed lines of credit  home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit  in the aggregate amount of  at december   which bancorp anticipates it will be able to fund  if required  from these liquidity sources in the regular course of business 
in addition to the foregoing  the payment of dividends is a use of cash  but is not expected to have a material effect on liquidity 
as of december   bancorp had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possible additional discretionary  actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be from loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  and the sale of loans 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be enough for bancorp to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
cash generated from these liquidity sources may be affected by a number of factors 
see risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we could receive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis and  in connection with this review  evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
while continuous movement of interest rates is certain  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan portfolio  bancorp originates a substantial amount of construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the following table represents bancorp s npv at december  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon information provided to the ots
