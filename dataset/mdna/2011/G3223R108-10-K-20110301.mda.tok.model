underwriting 
one of the company s strategies is to lead as many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites as possible 
the company leads on approximately two thirds of its treaty reinsurance business as measured by premium 
the lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate price  terms and conditions 
management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates 
when the company does not lead the treaty  it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty 
the company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors 
the company s treaty underwriting process involves a team approach among the company s underwriters  actuaries and claim staff 
treaties are reviewed for compliance with the company s general underwriting standards and most larger treaties are subjected to detailed actuarial analysis 
the actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience 
the company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties 
the company does  however  evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty 
the company may also conduct underwriting  operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines 
underwriting audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff  pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time 
claim audits may be performed in order to evaluate the client s claims handling abilities and practices 
the company s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks  limits and maximum risk exposures 
specified classes of large premium us risks are referred to everest re s new york facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given to clients 
in addition  the company s guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits  complexity or volatility  regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract 
non us risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within the involved operations 
the company s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers 
these programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the program manager s capabilities 
the company s rates  forms and underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types 
the company s underwriting  actuarial  claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms 
risk management of underwriting and retrocession arrangements underwriting risk and accumulation controls 
each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines 
these guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors  including ceding company profile  line of business  geographic location and risk hazards 
in each case  the guidelines permit limited exceptions  which must be authorized by the company s senior management 
management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit market conditions  risk versus reward analyses and the company s enterprise and underwriting risk management processes 

table of contents the operating results and financial condition of the company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses 
the company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by selective underwriting practices  diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business  limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones  purchasing reinsurance and or retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured cost effectively 
see reinsurance and retrocession arrangements 
like other insurance and reinsurance companies  the company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence  whether a natural event  such as a hurricane or an earthquake  or other catastrophe  such as an explosion at a major factory 
a large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties  facultative certificates and across lines of business 
the company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events 
accordingly  the company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas 
these techniques range from deterministic approaches  such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying reasonable damage factors  to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis 
no single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the company conducts business 
in addition  the form  quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the company s licensed models  which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections 
further  the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units 
also  while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events  catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise 
in addition  uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data 
nevertheless  when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment  catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events 
projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated loss  taking into account contract terms and limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake 
the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the make up of the in force book of business 
the projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods  such as year events and year events 
for example  a year pml is the estimated loss to the current in force portfolio from a single event which has a probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period 
in other words  it corresponds to a probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated pml 
it is important to note that pmls are estimates 
modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model 
as a result  there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml 

table of contents from an enterprise risk management perspective  management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the company may underwrite 
the limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to the company s financial resources and expected earnings and risk reward analyses of the business being underwritten 
management estimates that the projected economic loss from its largest year event in a given zone represents approximately of its projected shareholders equity 
economic loss is the gross pml reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes 
the impact of income taxes on the pml depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity  which is also affected by inter affiliate reinsurance 
management also monitors and controls its largest pmls at multiple points along the loss distribution curve  such as loss amounts at the     and  year return periods 
this process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk  underwriting and capital management decisions 
the company s catastrophe loss projections  segmented by risk zones  are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process

for the period from july  to july   the company s international underwriting operation has catastrophe loss reinsurance protection in place of of million excess million  excluding the territories of the us  japan  europe and caribbean wind 
the company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in the marketplace 
the company believes that its methods of monitoring  analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework  which are integrated with its enterprise risk management  underwriting and capital management plans 
however  there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the pml or other return period projections  perhaps by a material amount 
nor can there be assurance that the company will not experience events impacting multiple zones  or multiple severe events that could  in the aggregate  exceed the company s pml expectations by a significant amount 

table of contents terrorism risk 
the company has limited exposure to losses from terrorism risk 
while the company writes some reinsurance contracts covering events of terrorism  the company s risk management philosophy is to limit the amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for properties or in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists 
although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable  most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage 
as a result  the company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its us insurance book of business  particularly its workers compensation and property policies 
however  the us insurance book generally does not insure large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of risk 
as a result of its limited exposure  the company does not believe the us terrorism risk insurance act of that was signed into law november and amended in december and december has had or will have a significant impact on its operations 
reinsurance and retrocession arrangements 
the company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written  but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and or cost effective to reinsure a portion of the risks being assumed 
the company participates in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies  including the ceding company  with respect to the involved treaties 
the company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the us insurance segment 
the type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures  individual program exposures  aggregate exposures by line of business  overall segment and corporate wide exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance 
the majority of reinsurance placed is with captives of its general agents 
this arrangement is a mechanism designed to enable general agents to share in the operating results of the placed business 
facultative reinsurance will typically be considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for entire programs of business 
the company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of exposures 
such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the availability of cost effective retrocessional protection 
all of the company s reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore  are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance 
at december   the company had million in reinsurance receivables with respect to both paid and unpaid losses ceded 
of this amount  million  or  was receivable from cv starr bermuda cv starr  million  or was receivable from transatlantic reinsurance company transatlantic  million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental  million  or  was receivable from munich reinsurance company munich re and million  or  was receivable from berkley insurance company berkley 
the receivable from cv starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement 
the receivable from continental insurance company is collateralized by a funds held arrangement under which we have retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire  recorded them as a liability  credited interest on the balances at a stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments became due 
as of december   such funds had reduced the company s net exposure to continental to million 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables 
although management carefully selects its reinsurers  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies

table of contents claims 
reinsurance claims are managed by the company s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues  monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies  establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims 
in addition to claims assessment  processing and payment  the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies 
insurance claims  except those relating to mt 
mckinley s business  are generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the company s professional claims staff 
the company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental a e exposures through dedicated  centrally managed claim staffs for mt 
mckinley and everest re 
both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures 
these units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account  responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate 
specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the company are regularly communicated to senior management  actuarial  legal and financial areas 
senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the company s overall reserve positions and make changes  if appropriate 
the company continually reviews its internal processing  communications and analytics  seeking to enhance the management of its a e exposures  in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation 
reserves for unpaid property and casualty losses and lae 
significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves  which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred 
actual losses and lae paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves 
to the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and lae after taking into account available reinsurance coverage  the company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings  which could be material in the period such recognition takes place 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and lae reserves 
as part of the reserving process  insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts  changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends 
while the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer  due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future 
as a result  actual losses and lae may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates of reserves reflected in the company consolidated financial statements 
like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies  the company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years  which has led to increases in losses and lae reserves and corresponding charges to income loss in the periods in which the adjustments were made 
there can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income loss 

table of contents changes in historical reserves 
the following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the company for and subsequent years 
the table is presented on a gaap basis except that the company s loss reserves for its canadian branch operations are presented in canadian dollars  the impact of which is not material 
the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end date 
the upper paid portion of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end 
the lower liability re estimated portion shows the re estimated amount of the original reserves as of the end of each succeeding year 
the reserve estimates have been revised as more information became known about the actual claims for which the reserves were carried 
the cumulative deficiency redundancy line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the initial reserve less the latest estimate of the ultimate liability 
since the company has international operations  some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted to us dollars for financial reporting 
changes in conversion rates from period to period impact the us dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly  the cumulative deficiency line of the table 
however  unlike other reserve development that affects net income loss  the impact of currency translation is a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to differentiate these two reserve development components  the translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of effects on pre tax income resulting from reserve re estimates 

table of contents each amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  if a loss settled in for  was first reserved in at  and remained unchanged until settlement  the  deficiency actual loss minus original estimate would affect the cumulative deficiency for each of the years in through conditions and trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of future developments 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
ten year gaap loss development table presented net of reinsurance with supplemental gross data dollars in millions net reserves for unpaid loss and lae paid cumulative as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net liability re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative deficiency redundancy gross liability end of year reinsurance receivable net liability end of year gross re estimated liability at december  re estimated receivable at december  net re estimated liability at december  gross cumulative deficiency redundancy the canadian branch reserves are reflected in canadian dollars

table of contents every year in the above table  except and  reflects a cumulative deficiency  also referred to as adverse development  with the largest indicated cumulative deficiency in three classes of business were the principal contributors to those deficiencies the run off of asbestos claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the cumulative deficiencies for all years presented through  professional liability reinsurance  general casualty reinsurance and workers compensation insurance contributed to the deficiencies for years through  and property catastrophe adverse development contributed to the deficiency for in  the company completed a detailed study of its asbestos experience and its cedants asbestos exposures and also considered industry trends 
as a result of the study  the company increased its gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by million and increased its gross direct asbestos reserves by million 
these reserve increases  as well as adverse development on asbestos in prior years  have a significant impact on the cumulative deficiencies 
subsequent to the study  the company s loss activity has been in line with expectations per the reserves established at december  the company s a e reserves represent management s best estimate of the ultimate liability  however  there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves  perhaps by a significant amount 
no additional gross reserve strengthening was made during through in the professional liability reinsurance class  the early s saw a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate  financial and or management improprieties 
this resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the company 
in the general casualty area  the company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the company s pricing and reserving assumptions  particularly for the accident year 
in the workers compensation insurance class  the majority of which was written in california  the company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years and due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity 
as a result of significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment  the company s writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in some of its established and or stable lines of business 
although cumulative results through continue to be profitable for this book of business  there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years and the adverse development on the outstanding reserves was primarily attributable to foreign exchange rate movements resulting in an increase in the us dollar reserves 
in addition  the company experienced adverse development on liability exposures for sub prime for accident years and contractors liability exposures for accident years the contractor liability exposures are currently in run off 
the company also experienced adverse development on property lines but was offset by favorable development on other casualty lines 
the company s loss and lae reserves represent management s best estimate of the ultimate liability 
while there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future  management believes that the company s existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these statements regarding the company s loss reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the us federal securities laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein

table of contents the following table is derived from the ten year gaap loss development table above and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended december  each column represents the amount of net reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re estimates for the indicated accident years 
since the company has operations in many countries  part of the company s loss and lae reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to us dollars for each reporting period 
fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies  period over period  affect the us dollar amount of outstanding reserves

some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding 
the reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the ten year gaap loss development table 
the unfavorable development experienced in the and prior accident years relate principally to the previously discussed asbestos development 
other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance  including professional liability classes and workers compensation insurance  where  in retrospect  the company s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures 
the favorable development for accident years through relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property reinsurance business 
in addition  casualty reinsurance has reflected favorable development for accident years to the company s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends  seeking  on a timely basis  to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the company s underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis

prior years reserves decreased by million and increased by million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease for was attributable to a million decrease in non us reinsurance business bermuda and international  partially offset by the million increase in the us insurance  specialty  and reinsurance business 
the decrease in the non us reinsurance business was due to reserve studies that indicated net favorable reserve development  as well as reductions in loss estimates for prior year catastrophes 
the increase in the us reinsurance is primarily due to reserve strengthening in casualty lines for construction liability claims and the increase in the us insurance business is due to reserve strengthening on several terminated programs 
the increase for was attributable to a million increase in the insurance business  primarily contractors liability exposure  and million in the reinsurance business  in both domestic and international  as a result of increased reserves on sub prime exposures and property  partially offset by favorable development in casualty 
the increase for was primarily due to million of reserve development for a run off auto loan credit insurance program and a million adverse arbitration decision  partially offset by net favorable development on the remainder of the company s reserves
