liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through our initial public offering  private placements of equity securities  short term borrowings and funds generated from our operations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents of million are highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at date of purchase and consist of cash in operating accounts  investments in money market funds  various state and municipal governments  us government agencies and treasuries 
our short term marketable securities of million consist of investments in various state and municipal governments  us government agencies and treasuries all of which mature by december  our long term marketable securities of million consist of investments in various state and municipal governments  us government agencies and treasuries all of which mature by september  our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and continued progress of our research and development of new products 
we incurred minimal capital expenditures during the year ended december   and expect that capital expenditures during the next months will be relatively consistent 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  we transferred million and million of demonstration equipment to fixed assets 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock  from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions under a stock repurchase program 
the program will terminate upon the purchase of million in common stock  unless our board of directors discontinues it sooner 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million and at a weighted average price of per share under this program 
as of december   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares under this program at an aggregate cost of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities  as well as cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

net changes in working capital items reduced cash from operating activities by approximately million  principally due to an increase in inventory for anticipated future sales and lower than expected sales for the fourth quarter  as well as an increase in accounts receivable reflecting the record sales during  and an overall slowdown in collections as certain customers were affected by the overall economic environment and the tightening of the credit markets and an increase in accounts payable and amounts due to a related party of million 
these were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  principally relating to proceeds from option exercises of million  tax benefits related to stock options of million and partially offset by million in payments on capital lease obligations 

table of contents contractual obligations our significant outstanding contractual obligations relate to our capital leases from equipment financings and our facilities leases 
our facility leases are non cancellable and typically contain renewal options 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses for which we recognize the expense on a straight line basis 
in addition  we guaranteed the lease obligations for two facilities that are operated by sona medspa and will be obligated to pay these leases if sona medspa cannot or does not make the required lease payments 
we have summarized in the table below our fixed contractual cash obligations as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases lease guarantees total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition topic asc s  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and parts and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with 
table of contents service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s relative fair value in accordance with the principles of accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple element arrangements 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
we adopted asu during the second quarter of and applied it retrospectively beginning january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or statements of operations 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectability issues and our historical experience with losses 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk 
inventories and allowance for excess and obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease in inventory primarily relates to the transfer of demonstration equipment to fixed assets of million partially offset by increased purchases for the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  our inventory allowance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our inventory allowance primarily relates to the disposition of inventory reserved for in prior periods 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
product warranty costs and provisions we provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
fair value of financial instruments effective january   we adopted the fair value measurements topic asc asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair 
table of contents value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable markets data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
at december   our short term investments consisted of million  at par value  of auction rate securities ars investments 
the ars were managed by ubs financial services  inc ubs 
on november   we agreed to accept auction rate securities rights the rights from ubs 
on june   we exercised the rights and sold our ars to ubs at full par value 
at december   we held no short term investments 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock compensation topic asc 
asc requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
accordingly  we review our actual forfeiture rates periodically and align our stock compensation expense with the options that are vesting 
the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
our estimated expected stock price volatility is based on our own historic volatility for the period and based on a weighted average of our own historical volatility and of the average volatilities of other guideline companies in the same industry for the and periods 
we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry 
our expected term of options granted since adoption of asc was derived from the short cut method described in sec s staff asc the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with asc and the equity topic  asc income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
asc recognizes tax assets and liabilities for the cumulative effect of all temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents we account for uncertain tax positions following the provisions of asc asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the objective of this asu is to address diversity in practice in the application of goodwill impairment testing by entities with reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  eliminating an entity s ability to assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform step because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 
this asu is effective for interim periods after january  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or statements of operations 
in december   the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the objective of this asu is to address diversity in practice about the presentation of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations  and specifies that a public entity that presents comparative financial statements should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
this asu is effective prospectively for business combinations on or after january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of money market funds  state and municipal bonds  and us government agencies and treasuries 
the securities  other than money market funds  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
all investments mature by september  these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our fixed income investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio in available for sale debt securities 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

a significant portion of our operations is conducted through operations in countries other than the united states 
revenues from our international operations that were recorded in us 
table of contents dollars represented approximately of our total international revenues during the year ended december  substantially all of the remaining were sales in euros  british pounds  japanese yen  chinese yuan and south korean won 
since we conduct our business in us dollars  our main exposure  if any  results from changes in the exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked 
we have not historically engaged in hedging activities relating to our non us dollar operations 
we sell inventory to our subsidiaries in us dollars 
these amounts are recorded at our local subsidiaries in local currency rates in effect on the transaction date 
therefore  we may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations that occur while the debt is outstanding which we recognize as unrealized gains and losses in our statements of operations 
upon settlement of these debts  we may record realized foreign exchange gains and losses in our statements of operations 
we may incur negative foreign currency translation charges as a result of changes in currency exchange rates
