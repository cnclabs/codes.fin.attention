payless is comprised of two reporting segments payless domestic and payless international 
plg plg is one of the leading marketers of high quality men s  women s and children s footwear 
plg has a portfolio of brands that includes saucony  sperry top sider  and keds  addressing different markets within the footwear industry 
plg is predominantly a wholesaler of footwear  selling its products in north america in a wide variety of retail formats including premier department stores  independent shoe stores  value retailers and specialty stores 
plg markets products in countries outside north america through owned operations  independent distributors and licensees 
plg also markets its products directly to consumers by selling footwear through its stride rite children s retail stores  sperry stores and by selling its brands through outlet stores and through e commerce 
plg is comprised of two reporting segments plg wholesale and plg retail 
key events in  our business delivered strong earnings growth on a modest sales gain 
this was primarily driven by increases in sales and earnings from our plg wholesale and payless international reporting segments 
our plg wholesale brands  particularly sperry top sider and saucony  have delivered strong growth through refined brand positioning  product innovation  and distribution channel development 
our payless international growth came primarily from strengthening sales in latin america and leveraging costs 
our domestic retail businesses had performance declines in compared to most notably  our payless domestic reporting segment sales and operating profit have declined due to external factors as well as company specific factors 
the primary external factor was payless domestic s core urban and ethnic mass customer base continuing to experience high unemployment 
the primary company specific factor was not maximizing certain footwear trends in the first half of  although we made important progress in the second half of similarly  our plg retail segment delivered lower financial results through the first half of  but improved sales and operating profit year over year in the second half of through the first nine months of  we experienced lower product costs on like for like products we procured 
as a result  these lower product costs positively impacted our results of operations compared to the same period in product costs for like product increased in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we expect like product costs to increase in the mid to high single digit percentage range 
by the second quarter  this rate could increase to a high single digit percentage rate versus the prior year period 
we are working to mitigate the impact of these expected cost increases by using our size and scale to drive lower costs 
we will also rely more heavily on factories outside of china and in more cost effective locations within china 
in the event that we cannot mitigate these costs using these measures or by increasing the selling price of our shoes  our gross margins could be negatively affected 
impact of new federal legislation in the first quarter of  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law 
because we generally do not offer post employment healthcare benefits  we were not required to recognize a significant charge in associated with the change in tax treatment of medicare part d benefits 
we continue to review the impact this new legislation could have on us over a longer term

we use return on invested capital as a means to measure our efficiency at allocating capital under our control toward profitable investments 
the metric is also a component of the long term cash incentive award calculation for certain senior executives

net sales net sales at our retail stores are recognized at the time the sale is made to the customer 
net sales for wholesale and e commerce transactions are recognized when title passes and the risks or rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  based on the shipping terms 
all sales are net of estimated returns and promotional discounts and exclude sales tax

total cost of sales total cost of sales includes cost of merchandise sold and our buying  occupancy  warehousing and product movement costs  as well as depreciation of stores and distribution centers  net intellectual property litigation costs  tangible asset impairment charges and impairment of tradenames 
total cost of sales was  million for  up from  million in the increase in total cost of sales from to is primarily due to the impact of higher sales  offset by lower product costs in china in the first half of the year and lower occupancy costs in compared to product costs were flat in the third quarter of compared to the third quarter and were higher in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of total cost of sales was  million in  down from  million in the decrease in total cost of sales from to is primarily due to the impact of pre tax charges of million related to impairment of tradenames  million related to pre tax net litigation expenses  million of pre tax charges related to tangible asset impairment and other charges and million pre tax costs resulting from the flow through of acquired inventory recorded at fair value purchased in the plg acquisition

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared with in the increase of as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher incentive compensation related to company performance  offset by lower payroll related costs and advertising costs 
impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  due to weakening economic conditions combined with weaker than expected holiday sales  we revised our financial projections 
these circumstances indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill and  as such  we assessed the fair value of our goodwill to determine if its book value exceeded its fair value 
as a result of this update we determined that the book value of our goodwill exceeded its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of million within the plg retail reporting segment in we recorded no such goodwill impairment charges in or interest expense  net interest income and expense components were dollars in millions interest expense interest income interest expense  net the decline in interest expense in compared to is primarily a result of decreased borrowings of million on our term loan facility and senior subordinated notes and an average lower rate on our term loan facility 
the decline in interest income in compared to is primarily a result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balance 
the decline in interest expense in compared to is primarily a result of a lower interest rate on the unhedged portion of our term loan facility as well as decreased borrowings on our revolving loan facility  term loan facility and senior subordinated notes 
the decline in interest income in compared to is primarily a result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balance 

table of contents loss on early extinguishment of debt in  the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the acceleration of deferred debt costs on our term loan facility in proportion to the amounts extinguished 
in  the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the premium  in excess of par  paid to redeem a portion of our senior subordinated notes  the acceleration of the discount on the senior subordinated notes and the acceleration of deferred debt costs on both our senior subordinated notes and our term loan facility in proportion to the amounts extinguished 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was in versus in our effective tax rates have differed from the us statutory rate principally due to the impact of our operations conducted in jurisdictions with rates lower than the us statutory rate  the benefit of jurisdictional and employment tax credits  favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves due primarily to favorable settlements of examinations by taxing authorities and the on going implementation of tax efficient business initiatives 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the relative impact of these items on our tax rate on a comparative basis 
during fiscal year  we recorded net favorable discrete events of million relating primarily to the resolution of outstanding tax audits 
our estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at january  will decrease by up to million within the next months due to potential settlements of on going examinations with tax authorities and the potential lapse of the statutes of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent that these tax benefits are recognized  the effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by up to million 
at january   deferred tax assets for state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire as follows expiration dates are denoted in parentheses dollars in millions amount state operating losses expiring by state operating losses between and state operating losses between and state operating losses between and foreign net operating losses related to recorded assets carried forward indefinitely foreign net operating losses related to recorded assets in foreign net operating losses related to recorded assets between and total federal foreign tax credit carryforwards are million  million of this credit will expire if not utilized by  and the remaining million of this credit will expire if not utilized by federal general business credit carryforwards are million and expire between and if not utilized 
state income tax credit carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
the state tax credit carryforwards related to the recorded assets expire as follows million expires between and  million expires between and and million may be carried forward indefinitely 
the company has puerto rico alternative minimum tax credits of million which may be carried forward indefinitely 
the company also has a federal capital loss carryforward of million  expiring in  that has been fully reserved with a valuation 
table of contents allowance 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the major components of our net deferred tax liability 
we recorded a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets arising in the majority of this valuation allowance relates to net operating losses generated by our colombian joint venture which commenced operations in and has not yet established a pattern of profitability 
our consolidated balance sheet as of january  includes deferred tax assets  net of related valuation allowances  of million 
in assessing the future realization of these assets  we concluded it is more likely than not the assets will be realized 
this conclusion was based in large part upon management s belief that we will generate sufficient quantities of taxable income from operations in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
as of january   we have not provided tax on our cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million  because it is our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
the calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is complex and is not practicable 
if earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign governments 
based on the facts and circumstances at that time  we would determine whether a credit for foreign taxes already paid would be available to reduce or offset the us tax liability 
we currently anticipate that earnings would not be repatriated unless it was tax efficient to do so 
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent our joint venture partners share of net earnings or losses on applicable international operations 
the increase in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from to is due to increased earnings from our joint ventures 
the decrease in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from to is due to decreased earnings from our joint ventures 
non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures to assess performance 
these measures are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap because we believe these non gaap financial measures are helpful in explaining underlying performance trends in our business and provide useful information to both management and investors 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results 
we use adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap performance measure  because we believe it reflects the company s core operating performance by excluding the impact of the effect of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest  depreciation and amortization costs 
the following table presents the reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted ebitda dollars in millions net earnings loss earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of tax provision benefit for income taxes net interest expense including loss on early extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda the increase in adjusted ebitda in compared to is primarily driven by improvement in gross margin and higher sales  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents the increase in adjusted ebitda in compared to is primarily driven by increases in net earnings as a result of pre tax charges totaling million related to impairment of tradenames  net litigation expenses  impairment of goodwill  tangible asset impairment and other charges 
we also use free cash flow  which is a non gaap performance measure  because we believe it provides useful information about our liquidity  our ability to make investments and to service debt 
free cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
the following table presents our calculation of free cash flow dollars in millions cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow the decrease in free cash flow in compared to is primarily driven by lower cash flow provided by operating activities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by changes in the components of working capital due to increases in inventories primarily due to more units at year end versus lower than normal units at year end  a greater mix of higher cost products at payless and plg  and higher costs per unit and accounts receivable  partially offset by the impact of increases in accounts payable due to the extension of payment terms to our vendors and increases in net earnings 
the increase in free cash flow in compared to is primarily driven by higher cash flow provided by operating activities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by changes in working capital due to reduction in inventories driven by promotional activity and inventory reduction initiatives and increases in accounts payable due to the extension of payment terms to our vendors 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses 
finally  we use net debt  which is a non gaap performance measure  because we believe it provides useful information about the relationship between our long term debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents balance at a point in time 
net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
the following table presents our calculation of net debt dollars in millions total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt the decrease in net debt as of compared to was primarily due to our use of operating cash flow to pay down debt in the decrease in net debt as of compared to was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to an increase in cash from operating activities 
reporting segment review of operations we operate our business using four reporting segments payless domestic  payless international  plg retail and plg wholesale 
we evaluate the performance of our reporting segments based on segment net sales and segment operating profit loss from continuing operations as a measure of overall performance of the company

these were offset by greater promotional activity in compared to liquidity and capital resources our cash position tends to be higher in june as well as september to october  due primarily to the seasonality of our business  which is impacted by the cash received for sales during easter and back to school  respectively 
our cash position tends to be lowest around february to march when easter inventories are built up but not yet sold 
any materially adverse change in customer demand  fashion trends  competitive market forces or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix and retail locations  uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing  risks associated with foreign global sourcing or economic conditions worldwide could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations 
internally generated cash flow from operations has been our primary source of cash and we believe projected operating cash flows and current credit facilities will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  scheduled debt repayments  and to support the development of our short term and long term operating strategies 
substantially all of our real estate is financed through operating leases

the increase in accounts receivable was due to revenue growth in our plg wholesale reporting segment 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the extension of payment terms with our merchandise vendors

financial condition ratios a summary of key financial information for the periods indicated is as follows debt capitalization ratio debt to capitalization has been computed by dividing total debt by capitalization 
total debt is defined as long term debt including current maturities  notes payable and borrowings under the revolving line of credit  if applicable 
capitalization is defined as total debt and shareowners equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio  including the present value of future minimum rental payments under operating leases as debt and as capitalization  was   and  respectively  for the periods referred to above 
the sequential decrease in the debt capitalization ratio is primarily due to a lower debt balance as a result of our early extinguishment of debt and an increase in shareowners equity due to increased earnings attributable to collective brands  inc critical accounting policies md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 

table of contents inventories merchandise inventories in our stores are valued by the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
prior to shipment to a specific store  inventories are valued at the lower of cost using the fifo basis  or market 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail method  cost is determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio across groupings of similar items  known as departments 
as a result  the retail method results in an averaging of inventory costs across similar items within a department 
the cost to retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis 
current owned retail represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis  reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns 
as a result  the retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a traditional fifo cost basis 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the owned retail and  therefore  the ending inventory valuation at cost 
specifically  the failure to take permanent or clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost under the retail method 
we believe that our application of the retail method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
wholesale inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we reduce inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred  while expenditures for store remodels  refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the product capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
projects in progress are stated at cost  which includes the cost of construction and other direct costs attributable to the project 
no provision for depreciation is made on projects in progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into service 
property and equipment are reviewed on a store by store basis if an indicator of impairment exists to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable 
estimated future cash flows on a store by store basis are used to determine if impairment exists 
the underlying estimates of cash flows include estimates of future revenues  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
to the extent our estimates for revenue growth  gross margin rates  and store expense projections are not realized  we could record an impairment charge 
defined benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans 
one of the plans is frozen and no longer accrues future retirement benefits 
major assumptions used in the accounting for the other employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a cash flow matching approach for determining the appropriate discount rate for the defined benefit pension plan 
the approach is derived from us treasury rates  plus an option adjusted spread varying by maturity  to derive hypothetical aa corporate bond rates 
the calculation of pension expense is dependent on the 
table of contents determination of the assumptions used 
a basis point change in the discount rate will change annual expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the expected long term return on assets will result in an approximate change of million in the annual expense 
insurance programs we retain our normal expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  physical loss to property and business interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability 
we purchase third party coverage for losses in excess of significant levels 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon estimates of aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations 
these actuarial calculations utilize assumptions including historical claims experience  demographic factors and severity factors to estimate the frequency and severity of losses as well as the patterns surrounding the emergence  development and settlement of claims 
accounting for taxes our estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with the framework established in income taxes accounting guidance 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will not be realized 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
share based compensation we account for share based awards in accordance with the framework established in the share based compensation guidance 
share based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value on the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using a binomial model 
the binomial model requires various judgmental assumptions including the expected life  stock price volatility and the forfeiture rate 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of our reporting units may exceed their fair value 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we have five reporting units for the purposes of assessing goodwill payless domestic  payless international  plg wholesale  plg retail  and collective licensing 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and the company must complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the book value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical analysis that 
table of contents would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a combined income and market approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the market approach may involve use of the guideline transaction method  the guideline company method  or both 
the guideline transaction method makes use of available transaction price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the respective reporting unit 
the guideline company method uses market multiples of publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit 
we consider value indications from both the income approach and market approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit in our analysis 
we also compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization plus a control premium at each reporting period 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment has occurred 
we rely on estimates in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use our estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
our projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield  as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants is used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
because the selection of the discount rate is dependent on several variables  it is possible that the discount rate could change from year to year 
our goodwill balance was million as of january  goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level  which may be the same as a reporting segment or a level below a reporting segment 
the goodwill balance by reporting segment and reporting unit as of january  is as follows reporting segment reporting unit goodwill balance in millions plg wholesale plg wholesale payless domestic collective licensing payless domestic payless domestic total we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
a change in circumstances  a change in strategic direction or a change in the competitive or economic environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units in the future 
the fair value of the payless domestic and the plg wholesale reporting units substantially exceed their carrying value 
for the collective licensing reporting unit  a basis point increase in the discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit  holding all other variables constant  would result in a deficit between the fair value and the carrying value of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the projected long term growth rates of collective licensing would not result in a deficit between the fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit 

table of contents accounting for intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
favorable leases  certain tradenames and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
customer relationships are amortized based on the time period over which the benefits of the asset are expected to occur 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
as of january   we had million of indefinite lived tradenames that are not amortized but are assessed for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the impairment test for indefinite lived tradenames compares each tradename s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a tradename exceeds its fair value  the tradename is considered impaired and the company recognizes an impairment charge for the difference 
the fair values of our tradenames are determined using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method  which are forms of the income approach 
the relief from royalty method is based on the theory that the owner of the tradename is relieved of paying a royalty or license fee for the use of the tradename 
the excess earnings method calculates the value of the tradename by discounting its future cash flows 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment for tradenames has occurred 
we rely on estimates in determining the fair value of each tradename  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future revenues and long term growth rates for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future revenues  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
our projections of future revenues are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
reasonable market royalty rate for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value requires selection of appropriate royalty rates for each tradename 
the rates selected depend upon  among other things  licensing agreements involving similar tradenames  historical and forecasted operating profit for each tradename and qualitative factors such as market awareness  history  longevity  and market size 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the relief from royalty approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in the company s industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants is used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
because the selection of the discount rate is dependent on several variables  it is possible that the discount rate could change from year to year 
we performed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test in the third quarter of and concluded that there was no impairment of our intangible assets 
a basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in determining the fair value of our indefinite lived tradenames  holding all other variables constant  could result in an impairment of approximately million 
increasing the discount rate basis points or decreasing the projected revenue growth rates basis points would not result in a significant impairment charge 
in future periods  if our goodwill or our indefinite lived tradenames were to become impaired  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents accounting for derivatives we participate in interest rate related derivative instruments to manage our exposure on our debt instruments and forward contracts to hedge a portion of certain foreign currency purchases 
we record all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value in accordance with the framework established for derivatives and hedging and the framework established for fair value measurements and disclosures 
for interest rate contracts  we use a mark to market valuation technique based on an observable interest rate yield curve and adjust for credit risk 
for foreign currency contracts  we use a mark to market valuation technique based on observable foreign currency exchange rates and adjust for credit risk 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded either through net earnings loss or as other comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedge designation 
gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
accounting for contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
except for income tax contingencies  we record accruals for contingencies to the extent that we conclude that their occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are estimable and we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of recovery 
we consider many factors in making these assessments including the progress of the case  opinions or views of legal counsel  prior case law  the experience of the company or other companies in similar cases  and our intent on how to respond 
because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
new accounting standards see note of the consolidated financial statements for new accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest on our revolving loan facility  which is entirely comprised of a revolving line of credit  is based on the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a variable margin of to  or the base rate  as defined in the credit agreement 
there are no outstanding borrowings on the revolving loan facility at january   however  if we were to borrow against our revolving loan facility  borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility of libor 
on august   we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for million to hedge a portion of our variable rate term loan facility 
as of january   we have hedged million of our term loan facility 
the interest rate swap provides for a fixed interest rate of approximately  portions of which mature on a series of dates through may of the unhedged portion of the term loan facility is subject to interest rate risk depending on the volatility of libor 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s term loan facility debt  which totals million  would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
foreign currency risk we have operations in foreign countries  therefore  our cash flows in us dollars are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we adjust our retail prices  when possible  to reflect changes in exchange rates to mitigate this risk 
to further mitigate this risk  we may  from time to time  enter into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
for the weeks ended january   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our operations or cash flows 

table of contents a significant percentage of our footwear is sourced from the people s republic of china the prc 
the national currency of the prc  the yuan  is currently not a freely convertible currency 
the value of the yuan depends to a large extent on the prc government s policies and upon the prc s domestic and international economic and political developments 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of the prc s currency was pegged to the us dollar at a virtually fixed rate of approximately yuan per us dollar 
however  during  the prc s government revalued the yuan and adopted a more flexible system based on a trade weighted basket of foreign currencies of the prc s main trading partners 
under the new managed float policy  the exchange rate of the yuan may shift each day up to in either direction from the previous day s close  and as a result  the valuation of the yuan may increase incrementally over time should the prc central bank allow it to do so  which could significantly increase the cost of the products we source from the prc 
as of january   the last day of trading in our fiscal year  the exchange rate was yuan per us dollar compared to yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year and yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year
