table of contents financial performance the most significant contributing factor to increases in most of the major components of revenue and expense lines items in was the inclusion of a full year of agmh results of operation in compared with only six months in  as described below 
in addition to agmh full year contribution to income in  income was positively affected by commutation gains of million related to several agmh ceded reinsurance contracts  and a net tax benefit of million due to the filing of an amended tax return for a period prior to the agmh acquisition 
in  loss and lae on financial guaranty contracts accounted for as insurance and losses incurred on credit derivatives ie  claim payments plus changes in future expected losses on credit derivatives were higher than due primarily to higher us rmbs losses 
the changes in assumptions in a reflect a slower recovery in the housing market than had been assumed at the beginning of the year  and b include an increase in the assumed initial loss severities for subprime transactions from to 
mitigating the effects of this loss development were increases in the benefit taken for recoveries from breaches of r w  as the company loss mitigation efforts have been increasingly successful in obtaining commitments to repurchase and accessing new loan files 
credit spreads of underlying cds obligations and the company own credit spreads can have a significant effect on reported net income 
in  alt a option arms and alt a first lien transactions generated fair value losses due to wider implied net spreads 
this was offset in part by fair value gains in the pooled corporate and other sectors which had tighter implied spreads 
the adoption of a new consolidation model for variable interest entities vies on january  affects comparability between and on that date  vies were consolidated and four were deconsolidated  and throughout  additional vies were consolidated and others were deconsolidated 
as of december   the company had consolidated vies 
in  the company consolidated vies when it had both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the company continuously evaluates its power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of vies that have debt obligations insured by the company 
the company obtains protective rights under its insurance contracts that give the company additional controls over a vie if there is either deterioration of deal performance or in the financial health of the deal servicer 
under gaap  the company is deemed to be the control party typically when its protective rights give it the power to both terminate and replace the deal servicer 
the company elected the fair value option for all newly consolidated financial guaranty vies in  which required that changes in fair value be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
consistent with consolidation accounting rules  in  net earned premium of million and loss and lae of million associated with consolidated vies were eliminated from the reported results of operations 
the discussion of each affected revenue and expense line item below describes the financial effect in of this new accounting model

table of contents business overview since  the company has been the most active provider of financial guaranty credit protection products 
the significant financial distress faced by many of the company former competitors since  the company ability to maintain investment grade financial strength ratings throughout the financial crisis  and its acquisition of agmh in have all contributed to the company position in the market 
however  business conditions have been difficult for the entire financial guaranty insurance industry since and the company has faced challenges in maintaining its market penetration that continue today 
the recent us economic recession that began in following the start of a global financial crisis was the longest recession the us has experienced since world war ii 
the recession combined with the global financial crisis and  in some cases  highly leveraged financial risk  created significant credit and financial losses at many financial institutions  resulting in record levels of failures and government bailout of many global financial institutions and corporations 
within the financial guaranty industry  financial losses were concentrated in the us rmbs sector and  in particular  on collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by asset backed securities abs containing significant residential mortgage collateral cdos of abs 
the company has very limited exposure to cdos of abs  with only million in net par outstanding as of december  as a result of credit losses on these types of securities  and as discussed in greater detail under competition in item business  all of the company pre financial guaranty competitors  except agm  have had their financial strength ratings downgraded by rating agencies to below investment grade levels  rendering them unable to underwrite new business 
the company insurance subsidiaries have also been downgraded  principally due to their exposure to us rmbs  but because management substantially avoided insuring cdos of abs  agm and agc have retained double a level ratings  which have been acceptable for new business origination 
although the national bureau of economic research declared that the recession ended in june  housing prices have not consistently stabilized and the ultimate credit experience on us rmbs transactions underwritten from the end of through by many financial institutions  including the financial guaranty insurers  remains uncertain 
furthermore  while hiring trends have improved  unemployment levels remain high and may take years to return to pre recession levels  which may adversely affect assured guaranty loss experience on rmbs 
in addition  the economic recession has also affected the credit performance of other markets  including pooled corporate obligations insured by the company and  more specifically  trust preferred securities trups that include subordinated capital and notes issued by banks  mortgage real estate investment trusts and insurance companies 
the us municipal bond market  which has been the company principal market since  has also changed significantly during the past three years 
municipal credits have experienced increased budgetary stress  as the amount of sales  income and real estate taxes and other municipal excise or usage revenues collected by most states and municipalities have declined 
in addition  many states and towns have significant unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities that create additional budgetary stress 
the current economic environment has had a significant negative impact on the demand by investors for financial guaranty policies  and it is uncertain when or if demand for financial guaranties will return to their pre economic crisis level 
in particular  there has been limited demand for financial guaranties in in both the global structured finance and international infrastructure finance markets and also limited new issuance activity in those asset classes in which the company was previously active 
as a result  near term opportunities for financial guaranties in these two sectors are largely in secondary markets 
the company expects that global structured finance and international infrastructure opportunities will increase in the future as the global economy recovers  issuers return to the capital markets for financings and institutional investors again utilize financial guaranties 
financial guaranties had been an essential component of capital markets financings for international infrastructure projects and asset based lending  such as for auto loans and leases and equipment financings  but these financings have been largely financed in recent years with relatively short term bank loans 

table of contents with respect to the company  as discussed in the overview in item business  during  the company faced challenges in maintaining its market penetration 
the portion of the market that benefitted from the company insurance product was reduced as a result of a combination of the rating agency recalibration and upgrading of the ratings of municipal bonds  the downgrade of agc financial strength rating by moody in november  and the issuances under the babs program that constituted a large volume of the transactions in the us public finance market during the year 
in addition  both the uncertainty over the financial strength ratings of the company insurance subsidiaries and a negative perception of financial guaranty insurers arising from the financial distress suffered by other companies in the industry during the financial crisis have resulted in lower demand for the company insurance product 
in  the company insured of new us municipal issuance based on par 
the following table presents additional detail with respect to the company penetration into the us public finance market in  and municipal market data year ended december  par number of issues par number of issues par number of issues dollars in billions  except number of issues new municipal bonds issued new municipal bonds issued under babs program new municipal bonds insured all financial guaranty new municipal bonds insured agc and agm new municipal bonds insured under babs program agc and agm management believes that  in light of the prevalence of individual rather than institutional investors in the municipal market  the company is able to provide value not only by insuring the timely payment of scheduled interest and principal amounts when due  but also through its underwriting skills and surveillance capabilities 
because few individual or even institutional investors have the analytic resources to cover all the varied municipal credits in the market  which are estimated to number more than  through its financial guaranty  the company effectively consolidates the tasks of credit selection  analysis  negotiation of terms  monitoring and  if necessary  remediation 
management believes this allows retail investors to participate more widely  institutional investors to operate more efficiently and smaller  less well known issuers to gain market access on a more cost effective basis 
in fact  in  based on par  the company insured approximately of new us municipal issuance in the single a rating category  which is its target market  and more than of new us municipal issuance transactions that were million or less in size 
agmh acquisition on july   the company completed the agmh acquisition 
the total purchase price of million was paid in a combination of million in cash and million agl common shares 
agl issued approximately million common shares to dexia  all of which dexia subsequently sold in a secondary offering that closed in march the company acquired of the common stock of agmh pursuant to a purchase agreement with dexia and the remaining shares of agmh common stock from agmh former chief executive officer  for  agl common shares 
the company also exchanged the deemed investment of sean mccarthy  who became the chief operating officer of the company following the closing of the agmh acquisition  in  share units of agmh under a agmh nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a deemed investment in  share units of agl 
the agl share 
table of contents units will ultimately be distributed to mr 
mccarthy as a corresponding number of agl common shares at the time he receives a distribution from such nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
the agmh acquisition excluded agmh former financial products segment  which was comprised of its gic business  its medium term notes business and the equity payment undertaking agreements in the leveraged lease business 
the agmh subsidiaries that conducted agmh financial products business were transferred to dexia holdings prior to completion of the agmh acquisition 
in addition  as further described under liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to agmh former financial products business  the company has entered into various agreements with dexia pursuant to which dexia has assumed the credit and liquidity risks associated with agmh former financial products business 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the agmh acquisition was financed through the sale of  common shares and  equity units in a public offering in june the equity units initially consist of a forward purchase contract and a undivided beneficial ownership interest in  principal amount senior notes due issued by agus senior notes 
for a description of the equity units  see liquidity and capital resources commitments and contingencies long term debt obligations senior notes 
the net proceeds after underwriting expenses and offering costs for these two offerings totaled approximately million 
as described under wl ross investments  wlr funds managed by wl ross purchased  agl common shares in the june public common share offering at the public offering price in the public offering  pursuant to pre emptive rights 
the company has agreed with dexia holdings to operate the business of agm in accordance with the key parameters described 
these restrictions will limit the company operating and financial flexibility 
generally  for three years after the closing of the agmh acquisition unless agm is rated below a by moody and aa by s p  it will only insure public finance and infrastructure obligations 
an exception applies in connection with the recapture of business ceded by agm to a third party reinsurer under certain circumstances 
agm will continue to be domiciled in new york and be treated as a monoline bond insurer for regulatory purposes 
agm will not take any of the following actions unless it receives prior rating agency confirmation that such action would not cause any rating currently assigned to agm to be downgraded immediately following such action a merger  b issuance of debt or other borrowing exceeding million  c issuance of equity or other capital instruments exceeding million  d entry into new reinsurance arrangements involving more than of the portfolio as measured by either unearned premium reserve or net par outstanding  or e any waiver  amendment or modification of any agreement relating to capital or liquidity support of agm exceeding million 
agm will not repurchase  redeem or pay any dividends in relation to any class of equity interests  unless a at such time agm is rated at least aa by s p and aa by moody if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally and the aggregate amount of such dividends in any year does not exceed of agmh debt service for that year  or b agm receives prior rating agency confirmation that such action would not cause any rating currently assigned to agm to be downgraded immediately following such action 

table of contents agm will not enter into a commutation or novation agreements with respect to its insured public finance portfolio involving a payment by agm exceeding million  or b any cut through reinsurance  pledge of collateral security or similar arrangement involving a payment by agm whereby the benefits of reinsurance purchased by agm or of other assets of agm would be available on a preferred or priority basis to a particular class or subset of policyholders of agm relative to the position of dexia as policyholder upon the default or insolvency of agm whether or not with the consent of any relevant insurance regulatory authority 
this provision does not limit collateral arrangements between agm and its subsidiaries in support of intercompany reinsurance obligations  or statutory deposits or other collateral arrangements required by law in connection with the conduct of business in any jurisdiction  or pledges of recoveries or other amounts to secure repayment of amounts borrowed under agm soft capital facilities or its strip liquidity facility with dexia credit local sa dcl 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to agmh former financial products business strip coverage facility for the leveraged lease business 
furthermore  until the date on which a credit rating has been assigned by s p and moody to the gic issuers and or the liabilities of the gic issuers under the relevant gics have been separately rated by s p and moody which is independent of the financial strength rating of agm  and the principal amount of gics in relation to which a downgrade of agm may result in a requirement to post collateral or terminate such gic  notwithstanding the existence of a separate rating referred to in of at least aa or higher is below billion the agm de linkage date agm will restrict its liquidity exposure such that no gic contracts or similar liabilities insured by agm after the closing shall have terms that require acceleration  termination or prepayment based on a downgrade or withdrawal of any rating assigned to agm financial strength  a downgrade of the issuer or obligor under the agreement  or a downgrade of any third party  and agm will continue to be rated by each of moody and s p  if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally 
notwithstanding the above  all such restrictions will terminate on any date after the agm de linkage date that the aggregate principal amount or notional amount of exposure of dexia holdings and any of its affiliates excluding the exposures relating to the financial products business to any transactions insured by agm or any of its affiliates prior to november  is less than billion 
breach of any of these restrictions not remedied within days of notice by dexia holdings entitles dexia holdings to payment of damages  injunctive relief or other remedies available under applicable law 

table of contents the following table shows the assets and liabilities of the companies acquired in the agmh acquisition acquired companies after the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets 
the bargain purchase gain resulted from the difference between the purchase price and the net assets fair value estimates

the company recorded the fair value of these contracts based on what a hypothetical similarly rated financial guaranty insurer would have charged for each contract at the acquisition date and not the actual cash flows under the insurance contract 
this resulted in some agmh acquired contracts having a significantly higher unearned premium reserve and  subsequently  premium earnings compared to the contractual premium cash flows for the policy 
on the acquisition date  there were limited financial guaranty contracts being written in the structured finance market  particularly in the us rmbs asset class 
therefore  for certain asset classes  significant judgment was required to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired contracts 
the company determined the fair value of these contracts by taking into account the rating of the insured obligation  expectation of loss  estimated risk premiums  sector and term

table of contents results of operations estimates and assumptions the company consolidated financial statements include amounts that are determined using estimates and assumptions 
the actual amounts realized could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in the company consolidated financial statements

an understanding of the company accounting policies for these items is of critical importance to understanding its consolidated financial statements

the following discussion of the consolidated and segment results of operations includes information regarding the estimates and assumptions used for these items and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the company consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations the following table presents summary consolidated results of operations 
comparability of periods presented is affected by the inclusion of agmh results beginning july  and the adoption of new gaap accounting requiring the consolidation of certain vies previously accounted for as financial guaranty insurance on january  and the adoption of a new financial guaranty accounting model on january

beginning january   net earned premiums excludes the net earned premium related to consolidated vies under new vie consolidation accounting rules 
the consolidated vies are entities that are established and used in structured finance insured transactions for which the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest  as defined by gaap  due to its ability to terminate and replace the deal servicer
