net cash flows provided by operating activities for were million  compared to million provided by operating activities for the million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a million decrease in net income and a net decrease of million in cash flows from assets and liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in non cash reconciling items such as the loss on sale of discontinued operations  impairment charges  depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation and unrealized gains on financial instruments 
the million decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million decrease in income taxes payable  an million decrease in other liabilities and a million increase in receivables  partially offset by a million decrease in other assets and a million increase in deferred revenue 
during  we committed to a plan and sold our argentine operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations were as follows in millions years ended december  cash provided by used for operating activities of discontinued operations cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations cash provided by used for operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash provided by used for the argentine operations in  and cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations in primarily represents the cash on the balance sheet of the argentine operations at the time of the sale 
cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations in and primarily represents capital expenditures 
the sale of the argentine operations resulted in a pre tax loss of million  or a million loss  net of tax 
we do not expect the sale of our argentine operations to negatively affect our future liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities  available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for  compared to million for  a decrease of million 
during  approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily in near shore and offshore locations  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of lenders and keybank  as lead arranger  sole book runner and administrative agent 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  which is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants 
we drew down the full million term loan on february  in connection with the acquisition of ict on such date 
as of december   the entire million term loan has been repaid and is no longer available for borrowings 
see note  acquisition of ict  of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit agreement dated february  the million revolving credit facility provided under the credit agreement replaces the previous senior revolving credit facility under a credit agreement  dated march   which agreement was terminated simultaneous with entering into the credit agreement 
the million revolving credit facility  which includes a million multi currency sub facility  a million swingline sub facility and a million letter of credit sub facility  may be used for general corporate purposes including strategic acquisitions  share repurchases  working capital support  and letters of credit  subject to certain limitations 
we are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the revolving credit facility  if necessary 
however  due to recent economic conditions and the volatile business climate facing financial institutions  there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us  even though it is a binding commitment 
the revolving credit facility will mature on february  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either libor or the base rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
the applicable interest rate is determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time 
the base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the rate of interest established by keybank  from time to time  as its prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time  plus of per annum  and iii the then applicable libor rate for one month interest periods  plus 
swingline loans bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin 
in addition  we are required to pay certain customary fees  including a commitment fee of up to  which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
we paid an underwriting fee of million for the credit agreement  which is deferred and amortized over the term of the loan 
the related interest expense and amortization of deferred loan fees on the credit agreement of million are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  none in 
the million term loan had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  the credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material us subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of of the non voting and of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors 
as of december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit agreement dated february  on december   sykes bermuda holdings limited  a bermuda exempted company sykes bermuda which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sykes  entered into a credit agreement with keybank the bermuda credit agreement 
the bermuda credit agreement provided for a million short term loan to sykes bermuda with a maturity date of march  sykes bermuda drew down the full million on december   which is included in short term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  the bermuda credit agreement required that sykes bermuda and its direct subsidiaries maintain cash and cash equivalents of at least million at all times  which amount is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  interest was charged on the outstanding amounts  at the option of sykes bermuda  at either a eurodollar rate as defined in the bermuda credit agreement or a base rate as defined in the bermuda credit agreement plus  in each case  an applicable margin specified in the bermuda credit agreement 
the underwriting fee paid of million was deferred and amortized over the term of the loan 
sykes bermuda repaid the entire outstanding amount plus accrued interest on march  the 
table of contents related interest expense and amortization of deferred loan fees of million are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for none in 
simultaneous with the execution and delivery of the bermuda credit agreement  we entered into a guaranty of payment agreement with keybank  pursuant to which the obligations of sykes bermuda under the bermuda credit agreement were guaranteed by sykes 
also  simultaneous with the execution and delivery of the bermuda credit agreement  sykes  keybank and the other lenders that are a party thereto entered into a first amendment agreement  amending the credit agreement  dated march   between sykes  keybank and the other lenders that are a party thereto 
the first amendment agreement amended the terms of the credit agreement to permit the loan to sykes bermuda and sykes guaranty of that loan 
as of december   there were no outstanding balances and no borrowings in either or under the credit agreement dated march   as amended 
as previously mentioned  this credit agreement was terminated on february  simultaneous with entering into the credit agreement and unamortized deferred loan fees of million were written off during interest expense for includes million related to this terminated credit agreement 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash of million  of which approximately or million was held in international operations  of which million may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states  including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and repatriation tax on the foreign source income 
of the remaining million in cash and cash equivalents held in international operations  we repatriated approximately million in january the remaining balance of the million change of intent and in the future expect to repatriate million the remaining balance of the million determination of intent to distribute the majority of the accumulated and undistributed earnings of an ict foreign subsidiary 
there are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions 
we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows generated from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements  continued expansion objectives  funding of potential acquisitions  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next twelve months and any stock repurchases 
our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in item a  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations and other accounts payable accrued employee compensation and benefits other accrued expenses and current liabilities long term tax liabilities other long term liabilities amounts represent the expected cash payments of our operating leases as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which exclude other non cash accrued employee compensation and benefits  represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year 
other accrued expenses and current liabilities  which exclude deferred grants  include amounts as disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  primarily related to restructuring costs  legal and professional fees  telephone charges  rent  derivative contracts and other accruals 
long term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of these long term liabilities with the taxing authority  therefore  amounts have been excluded from payments due by period 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes and other non cash long term liabilities  represent the expected cash payments due under pension obligations and restructuring accruals primarily lease obligations 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results recognition of revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition 
we primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed  which is based on either a per minute  per call or per transaction basis  under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 

table of contents product sales  accounted for within our fulfillment services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
revenues from contracts with multiple deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if the deliverables in the contract s meet the criteria for such treatment 
certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple deliverables 
separation criteria included whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item  whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control 
fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis  which generally consists of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service  the contract s is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete 
we recognize revenues for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenues between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
if the separation criteria are met  revenues from these services is recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement 
if the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables  all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting 
for these deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value  revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight line basis over the contract period  or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client  as appropriate 
as of december   the company has no contracts containing multiple deliverables for customer contact management services and fulfillment services 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  million as of december  or of trade account receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain clients  historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 
income taxes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
at december   we determined that a total valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
a provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december   as the earnings are permanently reinvested in foreign business operations 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
the us department of the treasury released the general explanations of the administration s fiscal year revenue proposals in february these proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy  which may materially impact us taxation of international earnings 
we continue to monitor these proposals and 
table of contents are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns  and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
first  tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  a net increase of million from million as of december  this increase results primarily from to the acquisition of ict  partially offset by the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and for the resolution of a tax audit in had we recognized these tax benefits  approximately million and million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to million due to expiration of statutes of limitations  audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge  or loss  to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
new accounting standard not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 
which amended the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amended guidance will make it easier for companies to account for each deliverable in multiple deliverable arrangements separately 
the amended guidance will require the allocation of the overall consideration to each deliverable based upon its estimated selling price in absence of other objective evidence of selling prices 
the amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   and was adopted for applicable transactions as of january  we do not expect the adoption of this amendment to materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
us healthcare reform acts in march  the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act the acts 
the acts contain provisions that could materially impact the company s healthcare costs in the future  thus adversely affecting the company s profitability 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the acts  if any  on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us 
table of contents dollar usd are translated into the company s usd consolidated financial statements 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
we employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign exchange fx rates 
option and forward hedge contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in a foreign currency 
additionally  the company has employed fx forward contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations 
we serve a number of us based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the philippines and canada  which are within our americas segment 
although the contracts with these clients are priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php and the canadian dollar cad  which represent an fx exposure 
as of december   we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in php and cad by entering into foreign currency hedge contracts with counterparties to acquire a total of php billion and cad million through december the fair value of these hedge contracts as of december  is presented in note  financial derivatives  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the fx rates is approximately million 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
in january  to hedge intercompany forecasted cash outflows  we entered into additional forward and option contracts that are designated as hedges  as defined under asc asc derivatives and hedging  to sell billion philippine pesos versus the us dollar for maturities through december we also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against fx volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables  and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was a net payable of million 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
since december   we entered into additional foreign currency forward contracts against the following currencies php  cad  eurodollar  danish krone  great british pound  egyptian pound  australian dollar and romanian leu 
these contracts  with notional amounts of million  generally do not exceed days in duration 
see note  financial derivatives  of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates 
during  we had no debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
