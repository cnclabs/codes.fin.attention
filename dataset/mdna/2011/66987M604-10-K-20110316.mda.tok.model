overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products principally includes intelligent mobile hotspots  usb modems  embedded pci and wireless pc card modems and communications and applications software 
in addition  through our acquisition of enfora inc enfora on november   we provide asset management solutions utilizing wireless technology and machine to machine mm communications devices 
our products operate on a majority of the world s wireless networks 
our mobile hotspots and modems provide subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through wireless broadband and enterprise networks 
our mm products enable devices to communicate with each other and with server based application infrastructure 
our customer base is comprised of wireless operators  distributors  oems  and various companies in vertical markets 
our strong customer relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales 
we also are working to expand our product lines into adjacent markets that use wireless broadband technology 
we sell our wireless broadband solutions primarily to wireless operators either directly or through strategic relationships  as well as to oem partners and distributors located worldwide 
most of our mobile computing product sales to wireless operators and oem partners are sold directly by our sales force  or to a lesser degree  through distributors 
we sell our mm solutions primarily to enterprises in the following industries transportation  energy and industrial automation  security and safety  and medical monitoring 
we sell our mm solutions almost entirely through our own direct sales force 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wide area network  or wan  technology  ease of use  performance  size  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on time to market  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
the hardware components used in our solutions are produced by contract manufacturers 
their services include component procurement  assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery 
we have agreements with lg innotek  inventec appliances corporation  or iac  hon hai precision industry co  ltd  benchmark electronics  and flextronics for the outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  contract manufacturers provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in europe  the middle east and africa  or emea 

table of contents factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products 
this may place significant demands on our resources 
as a result of weak economic conditions globally  we have experienced lower demand for our products relative to the prior year  which has adversely impacted our results of operations 
while general economic conditions have shown some recent improvement  market competition remains intense 
as a result of this competitive pressure  demand for our products may continue to fluctuate unexpectedly  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
net revenues 
we believe that our future net revenues will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g and g products  g and g data access services  particularly in north america  europe and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  including our mifi line of intelligent mobile hotspots  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following economic environment and related market conditions  increased competition from other wireless data modem suppliers as well as suppliers of emerging devices that contain a wireless data access feature  demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  timing of deployment of g networks by wireless operators  decreased demand for ev do and hspa products  and changes in technologies 
we anticipate introducing additional products during the next twelve months  including g broadband access products  mm solutions and software applications and platforms 
we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like alcatel lucent  dell  qualcomm  sprint nextel  verizon wireless  virgin mobile  vodafone  telefonica  texas instruments  motorola mobility holdings and major software vendors 
through strategic relationships  we have been able to increase market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
as a result of the extremely competitive market for wireless devices  we have experienced significant downward pressure on the average selling price of our products 
this pressure has the potential to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in future periods and we cannot predict the magnitude or timing of future reductions in the average selling price of our products 
cost of net revenues 
all costs associated with our contract manufacturers  as well as distribution  fulfillment and repair services are included in our cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible assets  royalties  operations group expenses  costs associated with the company s cancellation of purchase orders  costs related to outside services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
operating costs and expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in north america  europe  and asia 
we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased 
table of contents research and development expenses 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing net revenues from sales of these products 
our operating costs consist of four primary categories research and development costs  sales and marketing  general and administrative costs  and amortization of acquired intangibles 
research and development are at the core of our ability to produce innovative  leading edge products 
this category consists primarily of engineers and technicians who design and test our highly complex products 
as we work to expand our portfolio of products and remain competitive  it may be necessary to increase our research and development costs in the future 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of our sales force and product marketing professionals 
in order to maintain strong sales relationships  we provide co marketing  trade show support  product training and demo units for merchandising 
we are also engaged in a wide variety of activities  such as awareness and lead generation programs as well as product marketing 
other marketing initiatives include public relations  seminars and co branding with partners 
general and administrative expenses include primarily corporate functions such as accounting  human resources  legal  administrative support  and professional fees 
this category also includes the expenses needed to operate as a publicly traded company  including sarbanes oxley compliance  sec filings  stock exchange fees  and investor relations expense 
general and administrative expenses have been relatively stable and are not directly related to revenue levels 
amortization of acquired intangibles include the amortization of customer relationships  covenant not to compete agreements and trade name intangible assets purchased through the acquisition of enfora 
as part of our business strategy  we review  and intend to continue to review  acquisition opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business 
if we make any acquisitions  we may incur substantial expenditures in conjunction with the acquisition process and the subsequent assimilation of any acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
merger acquisition activities in june  we submitted a bid to purchase certain assets of cinterion  a company in the cellular machine to machine communications industry  in connection with an insolvency proceeding 
we were not the successful bidder 
in connection with the bid  we borrowed million under a bridge loan facility in june and subsequently repaid all of the outstanding loan amount in july in november  we completed the acquisition of enfora for approximately million in cash  and contingent future cash consideration of up to million based on future earnings of enfora 
we estimated the fair value of future contingent consideration related to the enfora acquisition to be approximately million 
the cash consideration paid at closing of the acquisition was based on a cash payment of million and an additional cash payment of million for an agreed upon amount of enfora working capital 
in connection with the acquisition  the holders of outstanding enfora common stock  preferred stock  and vested stock options received total cash of approximately million  enfora s debt holders received approximately million to pay outstanding debt facilities  and other enfora acquisition related liabilities of million were settled 
the acquisition was financed with our existing cash resources 
our participation in these merger and acquisition activities resulted in the following significant impacts to our results of operations during the year ended december  we recognized million of interest and debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the short term debt facility in june and its subsequent repayment in july the costs were recorded in interest expense income  net 

table of contents during the quarter ended june  we recorded a foreign exchange gain of million in connection with the conversion of our euro denominated escrow funds into us dollars following completion of the cinterion auction 
this foreign exchange gain was offset by million paid for put options to hedge our euro exposure during the bidding process 
the realized foreign exchange gain and the cost of the put options were recorded in other income expense 
in connection with our bid for cinterion and acquisition of enfora  we incurred million in legal  advisory and professional fees unrelated to the bridge loan facility  which were recorded as general and administrative expenses 
enfora s results of operations and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning november  enfora contributed million to our consolidated revenues in results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of net revenues gross margin operating costs and expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were approximately million during  an increase of approximately million or compared to net revenues for ev do product driven technology amounted to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or compared to we benefited from the strong sales of our mifi product during that contributed to the increase in ev do net revenues 
ev do products are primarily sold in the north american market and represented approximately of net revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the same period in the increase from mifi sales was partially offset by a decline in embedded module sales due to the presence of competing products available to oems and the lack of significant sales to content delivery device customers during 
table of contents net revenues for high speed packet access hspa product driven technology amounted to approximately million in  a decline of approximately million or compared to this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in our embedded modules and ovation product sales due to the presence of competing products available to oems and wireless carriers primarily located in the european market 
hspa product revenues remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues representing of net revenues in each of the years ended december  and we believe the european market remains  and is expected to remain  intensely competitive for the foreseeable future 
net revenues also included approximately million in related to our enfora acquisition that was completed on november  cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of net revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in the primary driver of the increase in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues compared to was a decline in average selling prices that exceeded the rate of decrease in per unit product costs 
cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues is expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
cost of net revenues also included approximately million in from our mm products and solutions segment  including amortization costs of  related to purchased intangibles and a fair value inventory valuation increase of million in connection with our enfora acquisition 
increased competitive pressures may continue to negatively impact the average sales prices of our products 
this may require us in future periods to record inventory write downs to reflect lower of cost or market adjustments and revalue certain assets that may become impaired 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of net revenues  as compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in the decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in cost of net revenues discussed above 
we expect that our gross profit percentage will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on product mix  competitive selling prices  our ability to reduce product costs and changes in unit volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net revenues  compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in this increase was primarily due to increase in headcount and an increase in product testing and certification costs in the current year to support expanded research and development activities 
we believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our core business strategy 
as such  we expect to make further investments in research and development to remain competitive 
research and development expenses also included approximately  in from our mm products and solutions segment related to our enfora acquisition 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to fluctuate in future quarters depending on the amount of revenue recognized  and potential variation in the costs associated with the development of our products  including the number and complexity of the products under development and the progress of the development activities with respect to those products 
we may increase our investment in research and development to continue to provide innovative products and services 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net revenues  compared to approximately million or of net 
table of contents revenues in the increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and related expenses  an increase in expenses related to cooperative marketing and advertising to support marketing efforts for our mifi product primarily during the first quarter of sales and marketing expenses also included approximately  in from our mm products and solutions segment related to our enfora acquisition 
while managing sales and marketing expenses relative to net revenues  we expect to continue to make selected investments in sales and marketing as we introduce new products  market existing products  expand our distribution channels and focus on key customers around the world 
general and administrative expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net revenues  compared to approximately million  or of net revenues in amortization of acquired intangibles were approximately  in were related to intangible assets purchased from enfora 
the increase over the prior year was primarily related to merger and acquisition costs of million  partially offset by reductions in other expenses in interest income expense 
interest income expense  net  for the year ended december  was approximately million of net expense as compared to net interest income of approximately million in our net interest expense during is primarily related to interest charges  and debt issuance costs in connection with our repayment of the bridge loan facility during the third quarter of in addition  the company s interest income declined as a result of the liquidation of our investment holdings to facilitate our bid for cinterion in the second quarter of  the purchase of enfora in the fourth quarter of  and the overall decline in average yields experienced during the year ended december  other income  net 
other income  net for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  to approximately million  compared to approximately  of other income in the increase in other income was primarily driven by a million foreign exchange gain realized upon conversion of the euro denominated bid funds into us dollars in july at the conclusion of the bidding process for cinterion 
the gain was offset by million in premiums paid for protective put options we utilized to hedge our euro exposure during the bidding process for cinterion in the second quarter of these puts expired unexercised on june  income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was approximately million for fiscal the difference between the federal and state statutory combined benefit rate of and our income tax expense for is primarily due to a million increase in our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation allowance includes million of valuation allowance recorded during the second quarter of against us based deferred tax assets generated prior to  a million release of us based deferred tax asset valuation allowance upon the acquisition of enfora  and an additional million of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated in the valuation allowance and additional items impacting the income tax expense are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  we recorded a million tax benefit related to the carryback of our net operating loss in net income loss 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million  as compared to net income of approximately million in as discussed above  net loss was negatively impacted by decreases in gross profit  increases in operating expenses and changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million during  an increase of million or compared to net revenues for ev do product driven technology amounted to million in  an increase of million or compared to we benefited from strong sales of our mifi product 
table of contents primarily during the second half of that contributed significantly to the increase in ev do net revenues 
in addition  ev do net revenues were positively impacted by embedded module sales during the first half of primarily driven by sales to a content delivery device customer 
however  sales of embedded modules to laptop manufacturers significantly decreased year over year due to the impact of competing products available to oems during ev do products are primarily sold in the north american market and represented approximately of net revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the same period in net revenues for hspa product driven technology amounted to million in  a decline of million or compared to the decrease in sales of hspa products was primarily due to intense competitive pressure resulting in a steep decline in demand for our products in europe 
hspa products represented approximately of net revenues in the year ended december  compared to in the same period in cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues in the primary driver of the decrease in cost of net revenues in as a percentage of net revenues as compared to was a more favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins 
additionally  cost of revenues in was negatively impacted by inventory write downs to the lower of cost or market in as compared to cost of revenues in included a million inventory write down compared to a million write down recorded in the higher inventory write down in resulted primarily from the effects of lower average sales prices and demand for our hspa products due to competitive pressures and the slowdown of global economies 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues in the increase was primarily attributable to the changes in product mix of net revenues and cost of revenues as discussed above 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount  higher stock based compensation expenses  an increase in product testing and certification costs in the current year to support expanded research and development activities 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million or of net revenues in this increase was due primarily to an increase in cooperative marketing and advertising funds to support the launch of new products including mifi 
although total sales and marketing expenses increased during  it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in the decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower professional fees 
professional fees were significantly impacted during by approximately million in legal fees related to our ongoing class action securities litigation and our intellectual property device indemnification obligations as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
during  we incurred million in professional fees and related expenses as a result of our internal review of revenue cut off procedures  internal controls  and accounting related to certain customer contracts 
interest income expense 
net interest income decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to although our average cash and marketable securities balance increased period over period  average yields decreased 

table of contents other income expense 
other income for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  to  of income compared to  of expense in this increase was primarily due to the year over year strengthening of the euro and the related foreign exchange impact on our respective euro denominated accounts receivable and cash balances 
also  our gross exposure to euro based financial balances decreased year over year due to decreased euro based sales 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was approximately  for fiscal  which represents an annual effective tax rate of 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the recognition of an approximately million benefit in related to a derecognition of our uncertain tax liability  a benefit of million from the impact of research and development tax credits  a million tax expense impact of accounting for share based compensation and a million increase in our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
in the third quarter of  we reduced our uncertain tax liability by approximately million  including a related interest accrual of approximately  due to the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the taxable year and the completion of the examination of our federal tax return 
approximately million of this amount benefited the tax provision as a discrete item 
during  we recorded an additional tax expense of approximately million associated with share based compensation 
also  during  management evaluated our deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that valuation allowance should be increased by approximately million based on uncertainty associated with our ability to utilize increased deferred tax assets 
net income loss 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  as compared to net loss of approximately million in although operating expenses increased during compared to the same period last year  net income was favorably impacted by the increases in net revenues and gross margin percentage as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
we do not currently have a revolving credit facility or similar loan agreement 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that will allow us to sell up to million of equity  debt or other securities described in the registration statement in one or more offerings by us from time to time 
as set forth in the shelf registration statement  the net proceeds from the sale of our securities may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we had not issued any securities under this registration statement 
working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities year ended december  in thousands increase decrease working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included in working capital 

table of contents the significant components of our decrease in working capital as of december  compared to the prior year was primarily net cash used for our acquisition of enfora in the fourth quarter of of million 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  which is due to various factors  including an increase in fourth quarter sales volume in  the timing of sales and the timing of related collections 
in addition  our inventory and accounts payable balances increased due to expected product launches in fiscal as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million as compared to december   primarily due to consideration paid in connection with our acquisition of enfora 
see the discussion of cash equivalents  short and long term marketable securities by major security type in note in the consolidated financial statements  and the discussion of market risk that follows in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historical cash flows the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for compared to million for the million decrease was primarily attributable to our net loss 
the difference between our net loss of million in and our net cash provided by operating activities of million is primarily due to the favorable impact of non cash charges  including changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depreciation  amortization and share based compensation 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  which is due to various factors  including an increase in fourth quarter sales volume in  the timing of sales and the timing of related collections 
in addition  our inventory and accounts payable balances increased due to expected product launches in fiscal during  the difference between our net income of million and our net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the favorable impact of non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation  as well as the cash provided by working capital changes 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was approximately million compared to million used in investing activities in the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily related to our acquisition of enfora  net of cash acquired of million 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to the million principal repayment on july  of the short term bridge loan facility  offset by the million in net proceeds from the same debt facility 
net cash provided by financing activities during was primarily related to proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by fiscal year total operating leases capital leases committed purchase orders total contractual obligations our liability for uncertain tax benefits  including interest  as of december  was approximately million 
our tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is not included in our table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we do not believe that we will pay such amount within one year from december   however  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future payments with respect to this liability 
other liquidity needs we expect to incur ongoing professional fees and expenses to defend litigation filed against us or related to our products  which litigation is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these costs cannot be estimated at this time 
during the twelve months ended december   we plan to incur approximately million for discretionary capital expenditures  including the acquisition of additional software licenses 
we believe our cash resources from cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption in our business operations  a material failure to satisfy our contractual commitments or a failure to generate revenue from new or existing products 
we may raise additional funds to accelerate development of new and existing services and products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interests and securities issued may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities  we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of intangible and long lived assets including acquired intangibles resulting from the acquisition of enfora  valuation of contingent consideration  provision for warranty costs  royalty costs  income taxes  foreign exchange forward contracts  and share based compensation expense 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our revenue is principally generated from the sale of wireless broadband access solutions to wireless operators  oem customers and value added resellers and distributors 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of asset management solutions utilizing wireless technology and mm communication devices to transportation and industrial companies  medical device manufacturers and security system providers 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
where the transfer of title or risk of loss is contingent on the customer s acceptance of the product  we will not recognize revenue until both title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have granted price protection to certain customers in accordance with the provisions of the respective contracts and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we estimate the amount of price protection for current period product sales utilizing historical experience and information regarding customer inventory levels 
to date  we have not incurred material price protection obligations 
revenues from sales to certain customers are subject to cooperative advertising allowances 
cooperative advertising allowances are recorded as an operating expense to the extent that the advertising benefit is separable from the revenue transaction and the fair value of that advertising benefit is determinable 
to the extent that such allowances either do not provide a separable benefit to us  or the fair value of the advertising benefit cannot be reliably estimated  such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various factors  including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu we adopted the provisions of this guidance on january   which did not have a material impact upon our consolidated financial statements 
this standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements  such as product  software  services and support  to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction 
the standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist  how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables 
specifically  it modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item s  and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and instead requires that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
under asu  in multiple element arrangements  the total consideration received from customers must be allocated to the elements based on a relative selling price 
the new accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe  revenue has been based on the company s esp 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of the sale provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts allocated to post contract support pcs are recognized on a straight line basis over the pcs period  usually twelve months 
our process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
our prices are determined based upon cost to produce our products  expected order quantities and acceptance in the marketplace 
in addition  when developing esps for products we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist  and product specific business objectives 
we account for multiple element arrangements that primarily consist of software licenses and pcs by allocating revenue to each element based on vendor specific evidence of fair value 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  the entire revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or 
table of contents the delivery of the services  whichever is longer 
for multi element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation of the software  the revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed  at which point the entire revenue and cost of revenue for such arrangements are recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the pcs or the delivery of non essential services  whichever is longer 
in october  the fasb also issued asu  to amend the scope of arrangements under existing software revenue recognition authoritative literature to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance on january   which did not have a material impact upon our consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december    and  we have not recorded any significant revenues from multiple element or software arrangements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value or losses on inventory purchase commitments depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of acquired intangible assets 
in determining the purchase price allocation  the company considered  among other factors  its intention to use the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for enfora products and services 
the estimated fair value of intangible assets was based upon the income approach 
the income approach relies on an estimation of the present value of the future monetary benefits expected to flow to the owner of an asset during its remaining economic life 
this approach requires a projection of the cash flow that the asset is expected to generate in the future 
the projected cash flow is discounted to its present value using a rate of return  or discount rate that accounts for the time value of money and the degree of risks inherent in the asset 
the expected future cash flow that is projected should include all of the economic benefits attributable to the asset  including the tax savings associated with the amortization of the intangible asset value over the tax life of the asset 
the income approach may take the form of a relief from royalty methodology  a cost savings methodology  a with and without methodology  or excess earnings methodology  depending on the specific asset under consideration 
the relief from royalty method was used to value the trade name acquired from enfora 
the relief from royalty method estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset that would otherwise be 
table of contents required to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset 
the royalty rate used is based on an analysis of empirical  market derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets 
typically  revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
the royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings 
the key assumptions used in valuing the existing trade name acquired are as follows royalty rate of  discount rate of  tax rate of and an economic life of approximately years 
the developed technologies  customer relationships and backlog were valued using a form of the income approach known as the multi period excess earnings method 
inherent in the multi period excess earnings method is the recognition that  in most cases  all of the assets of the business  both tangible and intangible  contribute to the generation of the cash flow of the business and the net cash flows attributable to the subject asset must recognize the support of the other assets which contribute to the realization of the cash flows 
the contributory asset charges are based on the fair value of the contributory assets and either pre tax or after tax cash flows are assessed charges representing returns on the contributory assets 
a contributory asset charge for the use of the technology was assessed on pre tax cash flows  while contributory asset charges for the use of the working capital  fixed assets  and assembled work force have been deducted from the after tax cash flow in each year to determine the net future cash flow attributable to the relationships 
this future cash flow was then discounted using an estimated required rate of return for the asset to determine the present value of the future cash flows attributable to the asset 
the key assumptions used in valuing the developed technologies acquired are as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the customer relationships acquired are as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
the key assumptions used in valuing the backlog acquired are as follows discount rate of  tax rate of and estimated average economic life of months the covenant not to compete agreements were valued using the with or without method 
the with or without method measures the value of an asset as the difference between two scenarios 
one scenario measures the value of a business with the asset 
the other scenario measures the value without the asset 
the method treats the difference between the two scenarios with certain valuation adjustments as the value of the asset 
the key assumptions used in valuing the covenant not to compete agreements are as follows discount rate of and estimated average economic life of years 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their associated undiscounted expected future cash flows  which are determined using an expected cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over two to ten years 
as most of these assets are associated with technology or trade conditions that may change rapidly  such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 

table of contents valuation of goodwill 
our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of enfora in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  we will review goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicated a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all acquisitions 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
provision for warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if  based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate deferred income taxes on a quarterly basis to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in a decrease in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we will continue to evaluate the level of valuation allowance required based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the impact of uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 

table of contents share based compensation expense 
we have stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options and restricted stock units have been granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
we also had an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees  which was terminated in november share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis 
although the black scholes model is an acceptable model  the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards  as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of our million in cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of money market funds with the value of all of our cash equivalents determined based on level inputs  which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
at december   substantially all of our marketable securities are invested in fixed income products 
as such  our investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due in part to these factors  our future investment market values and income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other than temporary 
using a model that estimates the aggregate yield to maturity of our investment portfolio  we estimate that basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  our million in marketable securities by approximately  however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale within the meaning of asc topic  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other financial contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
credit risk we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities  which include various security holdings  types and maturities  with a number of financial institutions 
although the global credit crisis appears 
table of contents to have abated somewhat  credit risk remains 
as of the date of this report  we have not identified any significant credit risk associated with any of the financial institutions that maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and our marketable securities 
however  our ability to support our working capital needs depends  in part  on our available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
as a result  any significant decrease in the value of our investments may materially adversely impact our ability to support our working capital needs 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards specified in our investment policy guidelines at the time the investments are made 
at december   we have cash and cash equivalents of million 
of this million  million is held in cash demand deposits 
our million in cash equivalents at december  was held in money market investments 
these money market funds attempt to maintain a net asset value nav of per unit of investment 
should the underlying investments held by these money market funds suffer significant losses to market value due to interest rate changes or perceived counterparty risk  the nav of these money market funds may suffer declines below the targeted nav 
we hold money market funds that target a balance of investment return and preservation of invested capital through diversified holdings 
as such  we do not believe we currently have significant exposure to nav declines for our money market holdings 
at december   we had million invested in our portfolio of marketable securities 
our investment policy guidelines limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the fair value of our marketable securities at december  was determined based on level inputs  which were derived based on quoted prices for identical or similar assets  which had few transactions near the measurement period 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we generate euro denominated accounts receivable from sales to customers that are members of the european union  and we lack significant euro denominated purchases and trade liabilities to offset our exposure to this euro denominated accounts receivable activity 
during the year ended december   euro denominated revenue was approximately million 
as a result  we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  principally change in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts  principally forward currency foreign exchange contracts 
these forward currency foreign exchange contracts cover a portion  generally to  but may cover up to  of our euro based financial assets 
at december   we had approximately million million of euro denominated financial assets  as compared to million million in forward currency foreign exchange contracts with expiration dates of days or less 
at december   we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately  on our outstanding forward contracts 
in addition  at december   we recorded approximately  in unrealized foreign currency losses related to our outstanding euro denominated accounts receivable balances 
both the unrealized gain on the outstanding forward contracts and the unrealized losses on outstanding euro denominated receivables were recorded in other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
assuming a translation of our euro denominated revenue for the year ended december  at an average euro to us dollar exchange rate of and a uniform ten percent strengthening or weakening of this exchange rate  we estimate that income before income taxes for the year ended december  would increase or decrease  respectively  by approximately million 
this analysis does not give effect to any forward currency foreign exchange contracts that may be used to hedge foreign currency risk 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses discussed above based on fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposure and hedging transactions 

table of contents our sales to non european union countries are typically denominated in us dollars 
competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to increase prices in the event of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
sales of these products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  and in particular  the euro 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress the demand for these us manufactured products  reduce sales  or cause us to reduce per unit selling prices
