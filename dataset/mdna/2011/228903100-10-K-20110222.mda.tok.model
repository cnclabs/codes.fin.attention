item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated january  in florida  preserves and distributes human tissues and develops  manufactures  and commercializes medical devices for cardiac and vascular transplant applications 
the human tissues distributed by cryolife include the cryovalve sg pulmonary heart valve cryovalve sgpv and the cryopatch sg pulmonary cardiac patch tissue cryopatch sg  both processed using cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology 
cryolife s medical devices consist primarily of surgical adhesives  sealants  and hemostats including bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue  biofoam surgical matrix biofoam  perclot  which the company began distributing for starch medical  inc smi in october of  and hemostase  which the company currently distributes for medafor  inc medafor  although cryolife expects to discontinue sales of hemostase in late march because medafor terminated the hemostase distribution agreement 
for the year ended december  cryolife achieved record revenues  surpassing million in revenues 
in addition  cryolife generated million in cash from operations  the largest yearly inflow of cash from operations in company history 
cryolife used a portion of this cash to purchase assets from smi  common stock of medafor  and to repurchase cryolife common stock 
as a result of the transaction with smi  cryolife recorded million for prepaid royalties and intangible assets  and expensed million allocated to acquired in process research and development 
cryolife s operating income and net income for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by the expense of the smi acquired in process research and development as well as a write down of hemostase inventory and legal expenses related to its lawsuit and other dealings with medafor 
cryolife s net income for the year ended december  was also negatively impacted by the write down of the company s investment in medafor common stock 
see the results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during recent events on september  cryolife entered into a worldwide distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with smi of san jose  california for perclot  a polysaccharide hemostatic agent used in surgery 
in october cryolife announced that it had begun european distribution of perclot 
cryolife plans to file an investigational device exemption in with the us food and drug administration fda to begin clinical trials for the purpose of obtaining premarket approval to distribute perclot in the us on october  cryolife announced that bioglue had received shonin approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor  and welfare mhlw for use in the repair of aortic dissections 
cryolife s partner  century medical  inc  cmi will distribute bioglue in japan 
management estimates that distribution in japan will begin in the first half of critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold 
therefore  the tissues the company preserves and processes are not held as inventory 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations otpos  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
although the company cannot own human tissue  the preservation process is a manufacturing process that is accounted for using the same principles as inventory costing 
preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing and preservation activities and facility allocations 
preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to an implanting facility 
the allocation of fixed production overhead costs is based on actual production levels  to the extent that they are within the range of the facility s normal capacity 
cost of preservation services also includes as incurred idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  extra freight  and rehandling costs 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent otpos  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date  a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could result in an adjustment to or write down of deferred preservation costs and  therefore  materially impact the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the cost of preservation services on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as a part of the normal course of business  the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value or if there is any impairment to the costs for tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of its packaging 
cryolife records a charge to cost of preservation services to write down the amount of deferred preservation costs not deemed to be recoverable 
typically lower of cost or market value write downs are primarily due to excess tissue processing costs incurred during the write down period that exceed the estimated market value of the tissue  based on then recent average service fees 
impairment write downs are recorded based on the book value of the impaired tissues 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels if the market value of tissues increase or when tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company recorded write downs to its deferred preservation costs totaling   and  for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated deferred tax assets primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for tissue processing and product liability claims  and operating losses 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the period from through the third quarter of  cryolife maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of its deferred tax assets 
at each quarterly period during this time  the company concluded that  based on its analysis  a valuation allowance was needed on its deferred tax assets 
the company reassessed its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and the appropriate levels of the valuation allowance as of december  in conducting this assessment  management considered a variety of factors including the company s operating profits for the years ended december  and  the reasons for the company s operating losses in prior years  management s judgment as to the likelihood of continued profitability and expectations of future performance  and other factors 
based on this analysis  as of december  the company determined that maintaining a full valuation on its deferred tax assets was no longer appropriate 
as a result  on december  the company recorded a tax benefit of million on its consolidated statement of operations to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
the company continued to maintain valuation allowances on a portion of its deferred tax assets  primarily related to state tax net operating loss carryforwards that the company does not believe it will be able to utilize based on its projections of profitability in certain states and state carryforward rules and limitations 
in future periods the company will assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets as necessary when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its prior determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  related to state net operating loss carryforwards  and a net deferred tax asset of million 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards  and a net deferred tax asset of million 
the tax years through generally remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
however  certain returns from years prior to in which net operating losses and tax credits have arisen are still open for examination by the tax authorities 
liability claims in the normal course of business the company is made aware of adverse events involving its tissues and products 
any adverse event could ultimately give rise to a lawsuit against the company 
in addition  tissue processing and product liability claims may be asserted against the company in the future based on events it is not aware of at the present time 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to tissue processing and product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
any punitive damage components of claims are uninsured 
the company estimates its liability for and any related recoverable under the company s insurance policies as of each balance sheet date 
the company uses a frequency severity approach to estimate its unreported tissue processing and product liability claims  whereby  projected losses are calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims are determined based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim is calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the company uses a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of unreported claims included with respect to accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  during which the company experienced unusually high claim volumes  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  during which the company experienced an unusually high average cost per claim  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that the assumptions it uses to determine its unreported loss liability provide a reasonable basis for its calculation 
however  the accuracy of the estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
the company accrues its estimate of unreported tissue processing and product liability claims as components of accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and records the related recoverable insurance amounts as a component of receivables and other long term assets 
the amounts recorded represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported claims related to services performed and products sold prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and the short term and long term portions of the unreported loss liability and any related recoverable insurance amounts are as follows in thousands short term liability long term liability total liability short term recoverable long term recoverable total recoverable total net unreported loss liability further analysis indicated that the liability as of december  could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations calculated based on actuarial simulation techniques 
on march  the company bound liability coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is an eight year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
as of february  there were no pending tissue processing or product liability lawsuits filed against the company 
valuation of acquired assets or businesses as part of its corporate strategy  the company is seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies 
the company evaluates and accounts for acquired patents  licenses  distribution rights  and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group  or as a business combination  as appropriate 
the determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires significant judgment based on the weight of available evidence 
for the purchase of an asset group  the company allocates the cost of the asset group  including transaction costs  to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values 
in process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition 
the company accounts for business combinations by allocating the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred 
in process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued 
the company engages external advisors to assist it in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations  using cost  market  or income valuation methodologies  as appropriate  including the excess earnings  the discounted cash flow  or the relief from royalty methods 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgments and estimates  including  but not limited to timing of product life cycles  estimates of future revenues  estimates of profitability for new or acquired products  cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes  estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  estimates of the success of competitive products  and discount rates 
management  in consultation with its advisor s  makes these estimates based on its prior experiences and industry knowledge 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
a significant change in management s estimates used to value acquired asset groups could result in future write downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by the company and  therefore  could materially impact the company s financial position and profitability 
new accounting pronouncements the company is required to adopt fasb accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  asu requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or non recurring fair value measurements including i significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and ii information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu will not have an effect on the company s financial position  profitability  or cash flows upon adoption 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the three months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue orthopaedic tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase other medical devices total products other total revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue orthopaedic tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase other medical devices total products other total revenues increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
preservation services revenues from preservation services increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac preservation service revenues 
the increase for the twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in both cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues 
see further discussion of cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services consisting of revenues from the distribution of heart valves  cardiac patch tissues  and minimally processed tissues that are distributed to a third party tissue processor increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to the impact of a increase in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues and favorable tissue mix 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the aggregate impact of favorable tissue mix and a increase in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues 
for the three and twelve months ended december   shipments of cryovalve sgpv  cryopatch sg  and aortic valves increased  partially offset by a decrease in traditionally processed cardiac patch tissues and pulmonary valves 
the favorable tissue mix in the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the favorable impact of synergraft tissues including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  which command a premium fee over standard processed tissues 
in both the three and twelve months ended december   the decrease in revenues from traditionally processed pulmonary valves was more than offset by an increase in revenues related to the cryovalve sgpv  as hospitals continue to transition to the synergraft processed product  particularly after the company received fda clearance to extend the shelf life of the cryovalve sgpv to five years in the second quarter of in the three and twelve months ended december  the decrease in revenues from traditionally processed cardiac patch tissues was not fully offset by increases in revenues from the cryopatch sg 
the company believes that these revenues were unfavorably impacted by increasing competitive pressures and by a reduced supply of certain patch tissues available for shipment during the period as the company works to achieve an optimal balance among its offered tissues 
revenues from synergraft processed tissues  including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
vascular preservation services revenues from vascular preservation services decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which decreased revenues by  largely offset by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the decrease in vascular volume for the three months ended december  was primarily due to decreases in shipments of femoral veins and arteries 
cryolife believes that vascular revenues in the fourth quarter of were lower due to increasing pressure from lower cost competitive products  which may continue into the increase in vascular volume for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins  resulting from the strong demand for these tissues in domestic markets  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
the increase in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended december  was due in part to list fee increases on certain vascular preservation services  fee differences due to vascular tissue characteristics  and due to the negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
products revenues from products increased for both the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in hemostase revenues and  to a lesser extent  perclot revenues 
see further discussions of bioglue  biofoam  perclot  and hemostase revenues below 
bioglue and biofoam revenues from the sale of bioglue and biofoam decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange  which decreased revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of bioglue and biofoam decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the revenues were impacted by a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange  which decreased revenues by  largely offset by an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by 
the decrease in sales volume for bioglue and biofoam for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of bioglue in domestic markets  particularly in the northeast region of the us management believes that the decrease in domestic bioglue shipments is a result of various factors  including the us market introduction of sealant products with approved indications for use in clinical applications in which bioglue has been used previously  poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  the resulting attempts by hospitals to control costs by reducing spending on consumable items such as bioglue  and the efforts of some large competitors in imposing and enforcing contract purchasing requirements for competing non cryolife products 
the impact of foreign exchange for the three months ended december  was due to changes in the exchange rates in the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the respective periods in between the us dollar and the euro and  to a lesser extent  between the us dollar and the british pound 
the company s sales of bioglue and biofoam to german hospitals  austrian hospitals  and certain distributors are denominated in euros  and its sales through its direct sales force to united kingdom hospitals are denominated in british pounds 
the increase in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to list price increases on certain bioglue products that went into effect during and and the negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the company does not expect to see a similar level of benefit from price increases in as it did in sales of bioglue and biofoam for the three and twelve months ended december  included international sales of biofoam following receipt of the ce mark approval during the third quarter of biofoam sales accounted for less than of total bioglue and biofoam sales for the three and twelve months ended december  and domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue and biofoam revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total bioglue and biofoam revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  bioglue has reached a level of market maturity in the us and is experiencing increasing competitive pressures while continuing to achieve higher levels of growth and penetration in international markets due to its expanded clinical indications 
management believes that as economic conditions begin to improve  growth of bioglue revenues in future periods would most likely be due to price increases and smaller volume increases or expansions into new markets 
the company expects a decrease in usage of bioglue in the us in those clinical applications for which new sealant products have fda approval  partially offset by volume growth of bioglue due to increases in cardiac and vascular surgical procedure volumes where bioglue is used 
the company anticipates that it will begin shipping bioglue to japan in the first half of  as bioglue was recently approved in japan for use in the repair of aortic dissections 
perclot and hemostase revenues from the sale of perclot and hemostase increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of grams sold  which increased revenues by  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices  which decreased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of perclot and hemostase increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of grams sold  which increased revenues by 
the increase in sales volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in shipments of hemostase in domestic markets and to a lesser extent shipments of perclot and hemostase in international markets 
cryolife began commercial distribution of perclot in international markets in the fourth quarter of management believes that the company lost additional sales of hemostase during the third and fourth quarters of due to uncertainty in the market as to whether the company had authority to market hemostase and as to whether it would be able to continue to supply the product in the future 
management believes that third and fourth quarter hemostase sales were also adversely impacted by continued sales by medafor of medafor s product into the company s exclusive territory in violation of the private label exclusive distribution agreement between the parties eda 
the decrease in average selling prices for the three months ended december  was primarily due to discounting of hemostase inventory in an attempt to sell off the company s remaining inventory balances prior to the company s planned cessation of hemostase sales in late march  as discussed further below 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total perclot and hemostase revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and of total hemostase revenues for both the three and twelve months ended december  as discussed in recent events above  on september  cryolife entered into a worldwide distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with smi for perclot  an absorbable powder hemostat that has ce mark designation allowing commercial distribution into the european community and other markets
