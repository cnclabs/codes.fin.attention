item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in decision management dm solutions that enable businesses to automate  improve and connect decisions to enhance business performance 
our predictive analytics  which include the industry standard fico score  and our decision management systems power billions of customer decisions each year 
we help companies acquire customers more efficiently  increase customer value  reduce fraud and credit losses  lower operating expenses and enter new markets more profitably 
most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions  as do many insurers  retailers  healthcare organizations  pharmaceutical companies and government agencies 
we also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their fico scores  the standard measure in the united states of credit risk  empowering them to manage their financial health 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the banking including consumer credit and insurance industries  and during the years ended september   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from within these industries 
a significant portion of our remaining revenues are derived from the healthcare and retail industries 
our clients utilize our products and services to facilitate a variety of business processes  including customer marketing and acquisition  account origination  credit and underwriting risk management  fraud loss prevention and control  and client account and policyholder management 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from transactional or unit based software license fees  annual license fees under long term software license arrangements  transactional fees derived under scoring  network service or internal hosted software arrangements  and annual software maintenance fees 
the recurrence of these revenues is  to a significant degree  dependent upon our clients continued usage of our products and services in their business activities 
the more significant activities underlying the use of our products in these areas include credit and debit card usage or active account levels  lending acquisition  origination and customer management activity  and customer acquisition  cross selling and retention programs 
approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal  and  respectively  were derived from arrangements with transactional or unit based pricing 
we also derive revenues from other sources which generally do not recur and include  but are not limited to  perpetual or time based licenses with upfront payment terms and non recurring consulting service arrangements 
our revenues derived from clients outside the united states have generally grown  and may in the future grow more rapidly than our revenues from domestic clients 
international revenues totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total consolidated revenues in each of these years 
we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from international clients will increase in the future  subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
general economic conditions stabilized in fiscal from which we realized overall growth in our revenues of to million 
however  high levels of unemployment and financial market uncertainty continue to impact our customers in the united states and the pace of global recovery 
consumer and small business lending activity  which is one of the drivers of demand for our services  has stabilized in most markets around the world but in most cases is not yet showing strong growth 
we expect growth in consumer lending to continue to lag the general economic recovery 
in an effort to respond to these market conditions  we have continued to focus on activities related to our ongoing reengineering initiative 
as part of this initiative  we continue to manage our expenses to maintain solid earnings and cash flows and grow revenues through strategic resource allocation 
key components of the initiative include ongoing rationalization of our business portfolio  simplifying management hierarchy  eliminating low priority positions  investing in high priority positions  consolidating facilities and managing fixed and variable costs 
in fiscal  we completed additional actions under our reengineering initiative that was initiated in fiscal these actions were aimed at reducing costs through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
with respect to the headcount reductions  we identified and eliminated positions throughout the company 
also in 
table of contents connection with the initiative  we sold our liquidcredit service for telecom lct and roamex product line assets  and we fully exited our cortronics neural research product line  fast panel diagnostics product line and advertising services group 
during fiscal  we incurred net charges totaling million 
the charges included million for severance costs associated with the reduction of positions throughout the company 
we also recognized charges of million associated with vacating excess leased space in minnesota  georgia and illinois 
costs for vacating excess leased space represent future cash lease payments  net of estimated sublease income  which will be paid out over the next seven years 
for  the operating environment will continue to present challenges for the marketing and growth of our products and services 
however  we do expect to derive growth through modest improvements in the credit economy and from the momentum we achieved as a result of our performance in the latter part of bookings management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance 
bookings represent contracts signed in the current reporting period that will generate current and future revenue streams 
we consider contract terms  knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our customers  among other factors  when determining the estimated value of contract bookings 
bookings calculations have varying degrees of certainty depending on the revenue type and individual contract terms 
our revenue types are transactional and maintenance  professional services and license 
our estimate of bookings is as of the end of the period in which a contract is signed  and we do not update our initial booking estimates in future periods for changes between estimated and actual results 
actual revenue and the timing thereof could differ materially from our initial estimates 
the following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions used to calculate bookings and the susceptibility of these assumptions to variability 
transactional and maintenance bookings we calculate transactional bookings as the total estimated volume of transactions or number of accounts under contract  multiplied by a contractual rate 
transactional contracts generally span multiple years and require us to make estimates about future transaction volumes or number of active accounts 
we develop estimates from discussions with our customers and examinations of historical data from similar products and customer arrangements 
differences between estimated bookings and actual results occur due to variability in the volume of transactions or number of active accounts estimated 
this variability is primarily caused by the following the health of the economy and economic trends in our customer s industries  individual performance of our customers relative to their competitors  and regulatory and other factors that affect the business environment in which our customers operate 
we calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract 
professional services bookings we calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour 
we estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope  conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects 
estimated bookings may differ from actual results primarily due to differences in the actual number of hours incurred 
these differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of fico and internal resources used to complete a project 
license bookings licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract 

table of contents bookings trend analysis bookings bookings yield number of bookings over million weighted average term in millions months quarter ended september  quarter ended september  year ended september  n m year ended september  n m bookings yield represents the percentage of revenue recognized from bookings for the periods indicated 
n m measure is not meaningful as our estimate of bookings is as of the end of the period in which a contract is signed  and we do not update our initial booking estimates in future periods for changes between estimated and actual results 
transactional and maintenance bookings were and of total bookings for the quarters ended september  and  respectively 
professional services bookings were and of total bookings for the quarters ended september  and  respectively 
license bookings were and of total bookings for the quarters ended september  and  respectively 
transactional and maintenance bookings were and of total bookings for the years ended september  and  respectively 
professional services bookings were and of total bookings for the years ended september  and  respectively 
license bookings were and of total bookings for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the weighted average term of bookings achieved measures the average term over which the bookings are expected to be recognized as revenue 
as the weighted average term increases  the average amount of revenues expected to be realized in a quarter decreases  however  the revenues are expected to be recognized over a longer period of time 
as the weighted average term decreases  the average amount of revenues expected to be realized in a quarter increases  however  the revenues are expected to be recognized over a shorter period of time 
management regards the volume of bookings achieved  among other factors  as an important indicator of future revenues  but they are not comparable to  nor should they be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues  and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance 
although many of our contracts contain noncancelable terms  most of our bookings are transactional or service related and are dependent upon estimates such as volume of transactions  number of active accounts  or number of hours incurred 
since these estimates cannot be considered fixed or firm  we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings as backlog 
divestiture activity in june  we signed definitive agreements to sell the assets associated with our liquid credit for telecom lct and roamex product lines for million in cash 
we recognized a combined million pre tax loss  and a million after tax loss on the sales  as the goodwill associated with the sale of these product lines was not deductible for income tax purposes

as of september   we had million remaining under this authorization 
for a description of recent board authorization  see note to the financial statements in item of this report 
dividends we paid quarterly dividends of two cents per share  or eight cents per year  during each of fiscal  and our dividend rate is set by the board of directors on a quarterly basis taking into account a variety of factors  including among others  our operating results and cash flows  general economic and industry conditions  our obligations  changes in applicable tax laws and other factors deemed relevant by the board 
although we expect to continue to pay dividends at the current rate  our dividend rate is subject to change from time to time based on the board s business judgment with respect to these and other relevant factors 
revolving line of credit we have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on september  proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt  acquisitions  and the repurchase of the company s common stock 
interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on i a base rate  which is the greater of a the prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus or ii libor plus an applicable margin 
the margin on libor borrowings ranges from to and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
in addition  we must pay utilization fees if borrowings and commitments under the credit facility exceed of the total credit facility commitment  as well as facility fees 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of and a minimum fixed charge ratio of  and also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities 
as of september   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants

proceeds from these senior notes were used to repay the entire balance outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
these senior notes were issued in four series as follows series amount interest rate maturity date e million july  f million july  g million july  h million july  all of the senior notes are subject to certain restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility  including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the purchase agreements for the senior notes also include covenants typical of unsecured facilities 
capital resources and liquidity outlook as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  as well as available borrowings from our million revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements and any scheduled repayments of existing debt over the course of the next twelve months 
under our current financing arrangements we have no significant debt obligations maturing until may in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  or if we refinance our existing debt  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software licenses software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  software is made available to our customers  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
the determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectability is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance  expiration of the acceptance period  or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria 
we evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and change to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
when software licenses are sold together with implementation or consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using contract accounting as described below 

table of contents revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
transactional based revenues transactional based revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues from our credit scoring  data processing  data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed 
revenues from transactional or unit based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized based on minimum contractual amounts or on system usage that exceeds minimum contractual amounts 
certain of our transactional based revenues are based on transaction or active account volumes as reported by our clients 
in instances where volumes are reported to us in arrears  we estimate volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information or average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate transaction volumes in the future  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is received  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
consulting services we provide consulting  training  model development and software integration services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed price service contracts  we apply the percentage of completion method of contract accounting to determine progress towards completion  which requires the use of estimates 
in such instances  management is required to estimate the input measures  generally based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the project  with consideration also given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and  accordingly  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists  we apply the completed contract method of accounting and defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed 
if we are unable to accurately estimate the input measures used for percentage of completion accounting  revenue would be deferred until the contract is complete  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
hosting services we are an application service provider asp  where we provide hosting services that allow customers access to software that resides on our servers 
the asp model typically includes an up front fee and a monthly commitment from the customer that commences upon completion of the implementation through the remainder of the contractual term 
the up front fee is the initial setup fee  or the implementation fee 
the monthly commitment includes  but is not limited to  a fixed monthly fee or a transactional fee based on system usage that exceeds monthly minimums 
revenue is recognized from asp when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees is fixed or determinable and the collection of the company s fees is probable 
we do not view the activities of signing the contract or providing initial setup services as discrete earnings events 
revenue is typically deferred until the date the customer commences use of our services at which point the up front fees are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the customer arrangement 
asp transactional fees are recorded monthly as earned 

table of contents multiple deliverable arrangements including non software each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement that includes non software is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the following criteria are met i the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software and non software deliverables based on a relative selling price 
we use vsoe in our allocation of arrangement consideration when it is available 
we define vsoe as a median price of recent standalone transactions that are priced within a narrow range  as defined by us 
if a product or service is seldom sold separately  it is unlikely that we can determine vsoe 
in circumstances when vsoe does not exist  we then assess whether we can obtain third party evidence tpe of the selling price 
it may be difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate tpe and therefore we may not always be able to use tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use estimated selling price esp in its allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis 
our determination of esp involves weighting several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement 
the factors include  but are not limited to  geographies  market conditions  gross margin objectives  pricing practices and controls and customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle 
we analyze selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration on an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary 
selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 
gross vs 
net revenue reporting we apply accounting guidance to determine whether we report revenue for certain transactions based upon the gross amount billed to the customer  or the net amount retained by us 
in accordance with the guidance we record revenue on a gross basis for sales in which we have acted as the principal and on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectability of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment assessment our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  in connection with our business combinations 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets based on forecasted cash flows associated with the assets over the estimated useful lives 
goodwill is not amortized  but is assessed at least annually for impairment 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and 
table of contents services  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents or trademarks  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
estimates using different assumptions  or unanticipated events and circumstances could produce significantly different results 
we assess potential impairments to our intangible assets when there is evidence that events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to our previously recorded intangible assets with finite useful lives  we test for impairment using undiscounted cash flows 
if such tests indicate impairment  then we measure and record the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and other long lived assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit levels  which we have determined are the same as our reportable segments  at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would be an indicator of potential impairment of a reporting unit  with the fair value below its carrying value 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a weighted combination of discounted cash flow valuation model known as the income approach and a comparison of our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies known as the market approach 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  costs of capital and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we evaluate historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors when estimating these amounts 
the determination of an impairment loss  using assumptions that are different from those used in our estimates but in each case reasonable  could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
for example  if the economic environment impacts our forecasts beyond what we have anticipated  it could cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value 
the key assumptions that require significant management judgment for the income approach include revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
in our analysis  revenue growth rates were primarily based on third party studies of industry growth rates for each of our reporting units 
within each reporting unit  management refined these estimates based on their knowledge of the product  the needs of our customers and expected market opportunity 
the weighted average cost of capital was determined based on publicly available data such as the long term yield on us treasury bonds  the expected rate of return on high quality bonds and the returns and betas of various equity instruments 
as it relates to the market approach  there is less management judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units other than selecting which guideline publicly traded companies are included in our peer group 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date 
accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test and recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended september  
table of contents during our fiscal goodwill impairment analysis  we concluded the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
as discussed above  estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation using the fair value recognition provisions as required in the accounting literature 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock and our historical volatility rate 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
the dividend yield assumption is based on historical dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee options 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted  we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our share based compensation expense  net income and earnings per share 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  which requires the use of estimates 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period or reduce goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income 
to the extent an adjustment in our deferred tax assets relates to a business combination the adjustment is recorded either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that our valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable  and such an increase could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities also involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could also have a material impact on our income tax provision and consolidated results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to products and services  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
if the potential loss is considered less than 
table of contents probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure of the matter is considered 
the amount of loss accrual or disclosure  if any  is determined after analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
due to uncertainties related to these matters  accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time 
significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses 
revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

table of contents interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of two years or less 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

in july we issued an additional million of senior notes to a group of institutional investors in a private placement 
the fair value of our senior notes may increase or decrease due to various factors  including fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions

interest on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is based on i a base rate  which is the greater of a the prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus or ii libor plus an applicable margin 
the margin on libor borrowings ranges from to and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value of the instrument 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of september  forward foreign currency contracts we maintain a program to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk on existing foreign currency receivable and cash balances by entering into forward contracts to sell or buy foreign currency 
at period end  foreign denominated receivables and cash balances held by our us reporting entities are remeasured into the us dollar functional currency at current market rates 
the change in value from this remeasurement is then reported as a foreign exchange gain or loss for that period in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and the resulting gain or loss on the forward contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated assets 
all of our forward foreign currency contracts have maturity periods of less than three months 
such derivative financial instruments are subject to market risk
