our software is used to build a wide range of business process solutions including customer on boarding and account opening  crm  exception and case management  and risk fraud and compliance management 
we also provide professional services  maintenance  and training related to our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are large companies or divisions within companies  and typically leaders in their industry 
our strategy is to sell initial licenses that are focused on a specific purpose or area of operations  rather than selling large enterprise licenses 
this strategy allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and limits their initial investment 
once a customer has realized this initial value  we work with the customer to identify opportunities for follow on sales 
our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our prpc software and related solution frameworks 
prpc is a comprehensive platform for building and managing bpm applications that unifies business rules and business processes 
our solution frameworks are built on the capabilities of prpc and are purpose or industry specific collections of best practice functionality to allow organizations to quickly implement new customer facing practices and processes  bring new offerings to market  and provide customized or specialized processing 
these products often result in shorter implementation periods than competitive enterprise software products 
prpc and related solution frameworks can be used by a broad range of customers within financial services  insurance and healthcare markets  as well as other markets  such as life sciences and government

this offering enables our customers to immediately build  test  and deploy their applications in a secure cloud environment while minimizing their infrastructure and hardware costs 
our total revenue increased in compared to and reflects revenue growth in each of software license  maintenance  and professional services revenue 
maintenance revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of the fair value of deferred maintenance revenue acquired from chordiant and the continued increase in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from software licenses  maintenance fees related to our software licenses  and professional services 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  
table of contents generally contain multiple elements  including professional consulting services  training  and software maintenance services 
software revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements and recognized as those elements are delivered 
any remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license  the delivered element 
revenue is recognized for each element when all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
changes in the mix of the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
before we can recognize revenue  the following four basic criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement as evidence of the existence of an arrangement  we use a contract signed by the customer for software licenses and a statement of work for professional services 
delivery of product software is delivered electronically or shipped via disk media 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
in addition  we assess whether contract modifications to an existing term arrangement constitute a concession 
our software license agreements do not include a right of return 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer s industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
software license revenues perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract that is not perfunctory is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software other than maintenance support  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
as a result of our focus on frequent sales to our targeted customers  our strategy to sell initial term licensing agreements to those customers with the goal to generate follow on sales  and as a result of extended payment terms  we recognize term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
until  the majority of our term license arrangements were larger agreements with extended payment terms that did not typically result in follow on license agreements 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under the original payment terms  therefore for these arrangements  we have recognized the present value of the future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
a portion of the license fees payable under these agreements equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments was initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the 
table of contents license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used were estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate 
as of december   the discount rates associated with the remaining installment receivables ranged from to 
as of december   the remaining balance of these installment receivables totaled approximately million as summarized in the table on page for licensing arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products  fees are accounted for as subscriptions and the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
maintenance revenues first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support period  which is generally one year and subject to annual renewals 
perpetual license maintenance obligations are based on separately stated renewal rates in the arrangement that are substantive and therefore represent vsoe of fair value 
term license arrangements include separately stated maintenance fees and the company uses separate sales to determine vsoe of fair value 
professional services revenues our services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services  including software implementation  training  and reimbursable expenses 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
revenue from stand alone training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vsoe of fair value for our training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts in north america and europe  other than spain 
consulting services may be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for fixed price services 
when fixed price services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  and when services  including maintenance  are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
in the past  in a limited number of our arrangements  the fixed price services were essential to the arrangement because we made significant alterations to the functionality of the software or built complex interfaces necessary for the software to be functional in the customer s environment 
we have not been able to make reasonably dependable estimates for the purpose of determining our progress to completion  as we have limited experience with these types of unique and complex arrangements 
accordingly  when the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement  all revenue and costs are deferred until the completion of the fixed price services under the completed contract method 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized ratably during the service period  which is typically less than four months 
revenue from stand alone sales of pega cloud  our platform as a service offering  is recognized ratably over the term of the service 
warranties and indemnification we warrant to our customers that our software products will conform to documented specifications for a limited period 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 

table of contents our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no material claims were outstanding  other than as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently defending claims related to certain software that was assumed in the acquisition of chordiant 
deferred revenue deferred software license revenue typically results from customer specific acceptance provisions and other arrangements for which all of the criteria to recognize revenue have not been met 
deferred maintenance revenue represents software license updates and product support contracts that are typically billed on an annual basis in advance and are recognized ratably over the support periods 
deferred professional services revenue represents advanced billings for consulting and training services that are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for sales credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimates are based on the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate that resulted in their inability to make required payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of sales credit memos for services rendered 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of sales credit memos and assumptions about future events and experience with customer disputes 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment goodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business combination after all identified assets and liabilities have been recorded 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested annually  in the fourth quarter  for impairment by the fair value model at a reporting unit level 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and evaluate if it is impaired 
we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating potential impairment of these assets  we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including  but not limited to l whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset  l whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and l whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 
if indicators of impairment are present  we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate to its carrying value 
these estimates involve significant subjectivity 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

table of contents valuation of acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of chordiant and our preliminary purchase price allocation  we recorded million of intangible assets  relating principally to customer related intangible assets and acquired technology 
the valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections 
the principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows  which are based on a number of estimates and assumptions 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process 
the estimates and assumptions that are most sensitive include  but are not limited to l the selection of an appropriate discount rate  l the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income  l our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue from a market participant s perspective  l our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  l our technology life cycles  l the attrition rate of our customers  l our planned level of operating expenses 
accounting for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods 
sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
changes in our valuation allowance impact income tax expense in the period of adjustment 
our deferred tax valuation allowances require significant judgment and uncertainties  including assumptions about future taxable income that are based on historical and projected information 
we have preliminarily determined that we may utilize approximately million of acquired chordiant federal and foreign net operating losses nols 
the acquired federal nols are subject to annual limitations through as a result of the preliminary purchase price allocation  we recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million related to these acquired nols 
if our taxable income is not consistent with our expectations or the timing of income is not within the applicable carryforward period  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on all or a portion of these deferred tax assets 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
we classify liabilities for uncertain tax positions as non current liabilities unless the uncertainty is expected to be resolved within one year 
we classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense 

table of contents as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and nexus and tax credit estimates 
in addition  the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
see note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with equity awards in our consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
stock based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity award  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we recognize stock based compensation using the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
we periodically grant stock options and rsus for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors 
rsus deliver to the recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of our common stock upon vesting  net of tax withholding 
unlike stock options  there is no cost to the employee at share issuance 
we value our rsus at the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date  less the present value of expected dividends as the employee is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period 
the exercise price for stock options is greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of key assumptions including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of our stock price over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
the expected annual dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend of per share divided by the average stock price 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected option term at the time of grant 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the choice of a valuation model  and the underlying assumptions used in applying that model  involves significant judgment 
our judgment reflects our assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgment could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
to date we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately   and  of our total revenue from sales to customers based outside of the us in   and  respectively 
our international license and professional services sales have increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset our foreign currency exposure 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar  could adversely impact our revenues and operating results 
our us operating company invoices most of our foreign customers in foreign currencies  so it holds cash and receivables valued in these foreign currencies 
our us operating company s functional currency is the us dollar 
therefore  when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  we recognize a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we have intercompany accounts that are eliminated in consolidation  but that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  which are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of our acquisition of chordiant  we have expanded our international operations 
we hold us dollars in these foreign operations whose functional currency is the euro  which partially offsets our exposure to foreign currency transaction losses related to foreign currencies held by our us operating company 
as of december   we held cash and receivables subject to foreign currency transaction gains or losses with a net carrying value of approximately million 
a ten percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates as of december  would have changed the net carrying value of our net monetary assets by approximately million as of that date with a corresponding currency gain loss recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
during  we recorded a million foreign currency transaction loss due to the decrease in the value of our net monetary assets held in foreign currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  relative to the us dollar 
interest rate exposure during the first quarter of  we sold our marketable securities to pay for the chordiant acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we paid approximately million in cash  net of approximately million in cash acquired to complete the chordiant acquisition 
as of december   we had million of cash equivalents  which were primarily liquid money market funds  and million of marketable debt securities  which consisted of government sponsored enterprise bonds  corporate bonds  and municipal bonds 
due to the highly liquid nature of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk
