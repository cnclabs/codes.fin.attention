item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
description of noteworthy properties we are the operator of properties containing approximately of our proved oil and gas reserves 
as operator we are able to directly influence exploration  development and production operations 
our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows  subject to commodity price fluctuations  and thus provide a foundation for our technical staff to pursue the development of our undeveloped acreage  further develop our existing properties and also generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase our share value 
although  we believe that many of our existing fields have additional exploration and exploitation opportunities  these opportunities are held by continuing production operations and therefore we have deferred certain projects in favor of development drilling associated with our bakken and eagle ford shale  as further discussed below 
as common in the industry we participate in non operated properties on a selective basis  our non operating participation decisions are dependent on the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators 
the following is a description of certain of our noteworthy operated and non operated producing oil and gas properties 
bakken shale and three forks formations  williston basin overview we believe the bakken shale and three forks formations in the williston basin represent a large north american oil deposit 
a report issued by the united states geological survey  or usgs  in april classified the bakken formation as the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed by it in the contiguous united states 
our williston basin  bakken shale properties are located primarily in mountrail and williams counties  north dakota and in roosevelt and richland counties  montana 
we presently have working interests in approximately  net acres of which   net acres are in williams county   net acres are in mountrail county and  net acres are in roosevelt and richland counties 
as further discussed below  we have been involved in a non operated joint venture with slawson exploration company slawson primarily in mountrail county north dakota  since drilling activities in this joint venture increased appreciably over and consistent with our operating strategy  during and  we assembled acreage positions in williams county  north dakota and in eastern montana 
at present  we anticipate operating the majority of spacing units across our acreage  outside of mountrail county  and we continue to lease or otherwise acquire or trade for acreage within these project areas 
at present we are running one rig in williams county and eastern montana and plan to bring on a second and third rig during depending on drilling rig availability 
williams county  north dakota our williams county project area is comprised of  net acres  representing a working interest where we have lease positions in eighty two  acre spacing units 
we originated the project and brought in industry partners on a promoted basis 
we retained operations within a specified area of mutual interest 
drilling began in the project area in late we have drilled three operated wells and participated on one non operated well 
these wells are all in varying stages of completion and production operations 
roosevelt and richland counties  montana in eastern montana  we have acquired approximately  net acres where we are the operator of sixteen  acre units and have non operated interests in several additional units 
to date we have participated in three non operated units  two of which are producing and the other one is waiting on hydraulic fracturing 
we have also initiated our operated drilling program where we have drilled with the page

index to financial statements wheeler ranch  which is a vertical ratcliffe proved undeveloped location awaiting completion and we are currently drilling our first middle bakken well 
bakken non operated joint venture  north dakota our principal drilling activities in our bakken non operated joint venture are conducted through slawson exploration company  inc  but we also participate in this area with several other industry participants 
we have varying working interests in the  net acres ranging from to in montrail and nearby counties 
to date  over joint venture wells have been drilled by slawson and we also have nominal interests in over wells with other operators that are producing or are in various stages of drilling and completion 
for the quarter ended december   the total production net to our interest in the bakken trend was approximately  boe day and was approximately oil 
other williston basin fields we also operate other fields in montana and north dakota  including the fairview  fort gilbert and mondak fields in richland county  montana  the froid south field in roosevelt county  montana and the starbuck madison unit  southwest starbuck field  the landa  northeast landa  sherman and wayne fields in bottineau county  north dakota 
the montana fields are comprised of gross producing wells from the mission canyon interval through the red river interval 
we have an average working interest of with a net revenue interest in these fields 
the froid area has become prospective for bakken formation production with recent well activity in the area and we control five potential  acre drilling units and have working interests in two possible additional drilling units 
the sherman wayne fields consist of gross producing wells  which produce from the mississippian wayne interval 
we have an average working interest in the fields of  with an average net revenue interest of 
the landa northeast landa area has gross producing wells from the spearfish and madison intervals 
we have a average working interest and a average net revenue interest in these wells

we operate the units and at the starbuck madison unit have an average working interest of approximately and an average net revenue interest of 
at southwest starbuck  we have a working interest and a net revenue interest 
these two water floods had production net to our interest of boe day oil for the quarter ended december  for the same period  the production net to our interest in the remaining williston basin fields  including those mentioned above but excluding the bakken and starbuck areas  was approximately boe day oil 
eagle ford shale trend our eagle ford properties are located in atascosa  fayette  gonzales and mcmullen counties of texas 
in southwest fayette county  we have entered into agreements with an industry partner  which established an area of mutual interest  resulted in a cash payment of million for a undivided interest in our acreage  provides for the drilling and completion of six wells  where we retain a interest  without cost to us and further provides us with a retained overriding royalty interest 
the agreement also provides for additional leasing 
our net acreage position in the eagle ford trend totals approximately  acres 
our initial drilling unit is the acre flatonia east unit  located in southwest fayette county  texas 
we have drilled and cased our initial well in the unit and are currently drilling the second unit well

in addition  we are the general partner and owner of a limited partnership that owns an average working interest with an average net revenue interest in the giddings field 
our acreage position is  net acres  with approximately  net acres held directly and approximately  net acres held through our interest in the limited partnership 
from to early  when we suspended our drilling operations due to low gas prices  we drilled wells with a success rate 
we have remaining austin chalk drilling locations and believe the acreage is prospective for the yegua  georgetown and eagle ford formations 
production from the giddings field is primarily gas and for the quarter ended december   the production net to our interest in the giddings field was approximately  mcfe day and was approximately gas 
an additional  mcfe day gas was attributable to our share of the limited partnership 
our acquisition in giddings and nearby fields was located primarily in brazos and madison counties  texas 
this property consists of producers with all but three page

title to properties it is customary in the oil and gas industry to make a limited review of title to undeveloped oil and gas leases at the time they are acquired 
it is also customary to obtain more extensive title examinations prior to the commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped leases or prior to the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties 
with respect to the future acquisition of both undeveloped and proved properties  we plan to conduct title examinations on such properties in a manner consistent with industry and banking practices 
we have obtained title opinions  title reports or otherwise conducted title investigations covering substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  overriding royalty interests  and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of such properties 
substantially all of our oil and gas properties are and may continue to be mortgaged to secure borrowings under bank credit facilities see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto reflected in the index to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
general we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development and production of oil and gas reserves in multiple basins 
as further discussed in this report  future growth in assets  earnings  cash flows and share values will be dependent upon our ability to acquire  discover and develop commercial quantities of oil and gas reserves that can be produced at a profit  and assemble an oil and gas reserve base with a market value exceeding its acquisition  development and production costs 
our strategy includes a combination of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
historically  we have shifted our emphasis among these basic activities to take advantage of changing market conditions and to facilitate profitable growth 
the majority of our efforts are currently focused on developing our oil weighted acreage positions in the bakken trend of montana and north dakota and the eagle ford trend of texas 
in addition  it is essential that  over time  our personnel expand our current projects and or generate additional projects so we have the potential of economically replacing our production and increasing our proved reserves 
following is a brief outline of our current plans accelerate the development of our acreage positions in the bakken and eagle ford trends  expand our acreage positions and drilling inventory 
solicit industry partners  on a promoted basis  where we can retain operations and control large acreage positions in order to diversify  enhance economics and generate operating fees  generate additional exploration and development projects  acquire oil and gas properties with producing reserves and development and exploration potential  within our focus areas  selectively divest assets to high grade our producing property portfolio and to lower corporate wide per unit operating and administrative costs  and focus attention on existing fields and new projects with greater development and exploitation potential  and obtain additional capital  as needed  through the issuance of equity securities and or through debt financing 
while the impact and success of our corporate plans cannot be predicted with accuracy  our goal is to replace production and further increase our reserve base at an acquisition or finding cost that will yield attractive rates of return 
in addition to our fundamental business strategy  we intend to pursue corporate acquisitions and mergers 
we believe that a corporate acquisition or merger could potentially accelerate growth  increase market visibility and realize operating and administrative benefits 
accordingly  we intend to consider any such opportunities which may become available that we consider beneficial to our stockholders 
the primary financial considerations in the evaluation of any such potential transactions include  but are not limited to the potential to increase assets in a core area  the opportunity to increase our earnings and cash flow on a per share basis  development and exploration potential  and realization of administrative savings 
further  we believe a corporate acquisition could lead to increased visibility in the market place  greater trading volume and therefore greater shareholder liquidity and possibly access to capital with lower costs

index to financial statements recent property acquisitions during we continued our drilling programs and expanded our acreage positions 
we also acquired producing and undeveloped properties  principally in the bakken shale trend in the williston basin  north dakota and in the giddings field  texas 
a summary of our activities is as follows in october  the company initiated a leasing program in williams county  north dakota with the objective of establishing a significant operated position in the bakken shale trend 
in february  the company entered into agreements with two unaffiliated third parties under which we sold each of them an interest in existing acreage and they agreed with us to acquire additional acreage and jointly develop the project area 
cash proceeds to us totaled approximately million and we retained a working interest in the project area 
the agreement also provided for up to million million net to the company of additional joint leasing in a contractually specified area of mutual interest ami 
as of december  our net acreage position in the project area totals approximately  acres 
for accounting purposes the company uses the cost recovery method  under this method proceeds from joint owners have been recorded in the balance sheet as a reduction to the carrying value of the unproved properties 
on july  the company closed an acquisition of producing oil and gas properties located in the giddings field of central texas 
the purchase price was million plus closing adjustments for normal operations activity 
the acquisition covered approximately  net acres and was funded through borrowings under our credit facility 
in september  we company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to jointly acquire and develop mineral leases in the eagle ford shale trend of texas 
as part of this agreement  the company sold a working interest in its acreage for million 
for accounting purposes  the company uses the cost recovery method  under this method  proceeds from joint owners are recorded in the balance sheet as a reduction of the carrying value of unproved properties 
the purchaser also agreed to pay the drilling costs for the first six wells to be drilled in a contractually specified ami 
the agreement also provides for an additional million million net to the company for additional leasing within the ami 
subsequent to the initial closing  the company and the joint owners have continued to acquire leases within the ami pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
in november  the company purchased an membership interest in trigon energy partners  llc trigon  which owns undeveloped leases in the eagle ford shale trend of texas for approximately million 
the company fully consolidated trigon and recorded a non controlling minority interest of million at december  for the year ended december   trigon did not generate any revenue or net income 
the company s share of trigon s undeveloped leases is included the eagle ford acreage totals throughout this report

hedging activities management attempts to reduce our sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility and secure favorable debt financing terms by entering into hedging transactions which may include fixed price swaps  price collars  puts and other derivatives 
we believe our hedging strategy should result in greater predictability of internally generated funds  which in turn can be dedicated to capital development projects and corporate obligations

based on the estimated fair market value of our derivatives  designated as hedges at december   we expect to reclassify net losses on commodity derivatives of million into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income loss during the next twelve months  however  actual cash settlement gains and losses recognized may differ materially 
at december   a increase in per unit commodity prices would cause the total fair value liability of our commodity derivative financial instruments to increase by million to million 
a decrease in per unit commodity prices would cause the fair value liability to change to an asset of million due to an estimated million decrease in the net liability 
there would also be a similar increase or decrease in other comprehensive income loss included in total equity in the balance sheet 
since we have designated all of our commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges and therefore the change in market value of the effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income  a change in fair value would not have a significant effect on net income

hedging commodity prices for a portion of our production is a fundamental part of our corporate financial management 
we do not engage in speculative commodity trading activities and do not hedge all available or anticipated quantities of our production 
in implementing our hedging strategy we seek to effectively manage cash flow to minimize price volatility and generate internal funds available for operations  capital development projects and additional acquisitions  and ensure our ability to support our exploration activities as well as administrative and debt service obligation 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices which  although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculation cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain fair value positions from our counterparties and compare that value to our internally calculated value 
we believe that our practice of comparing our value to that of our counterparties  who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations  reduces our risk of error and approximates the fair value of the contracts  as the fair value obtained from our counterparties would be the cost to us to terminate a contract at that point in time 
commitments and contingencies we have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year in thousands long term debt commodity derivatives operating leases asset retirement obligations thereafter long term debt is the outstanding principal amount and interest under our credit agreement at december  interest is calculated using the annual interest rate in effect at december  of

represents the estimates of future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis 
the discounted present value of the asset retirement obligations at december  is million 
administrative and operating costs on an ongoing basis  we focus on cost containment efforts related to administrative and operating costs 
however  we must continue to attract and retain competent management  technical and administrative personnel to successfully pursue our business strategy and fulfill our contractual obligations 
our industry has experienced a shortage of such personnel over the past few years  and we expect this shortage to continue as long as oil prices and demand for services in our key operating areas remain at historically high levels 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to finance future acquisition  development and exploration activities through available working capital  cash flows from operating activities  our bank credit facility  sale of non strategic assets  various means of corporate and project finance and possibly through issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
in addition  we intend to continue to partially finance our drilling activities through the sale of participations to industry or institutional partners on a promoted basis  whereby we may earn working interests in reserves and production greater than our proportionate capital costs 
financing activities during resulted in a net increase in our debt of million from the outstanding debt of million at december  we borrowed million to fund the acquisitions of producing properties and acreage in our bakken and eagle ford areas and made principal debt payments of million 
financing activities during resulted in a net increase in debt of million from the outstanding debt of million at december  during the second quarter of  we borrowed an additional million to fund the sbe partners and bakken acquisitions

the borrowing base is redetermined in may and november of each year 
as a result of the successful public stock offering in january  we have reduced our outstanding line of credit debt to zero and now have million available under the facility 
cash flows from operating activities for  net cash provided by operating activities was million  an increase of million from we believe that we can continue to generate cash flows sufficient to allow us to continue with our planned capital expenditures program which will replace our reserves and increase our oil and gas production  assuming page

capital expenditures budget we continue to expand our portfolio of drilling and development projects and therefore have increased our projected drilling and development expenditures 
as summarized below  we estimate our capital budget for will total million 
while the table includes the bulk of our currently identified drilling for  we are constantly working on developing and acquiring new opportunities 
a benefit of our property portfolio is that it consists of relatively new acreage positions and therefore we generally have two to five years to drill the bulk of our undeveloped leases 
in addition  many of our drilling opportunities  including the bulk of our gas drilling locations  are held by production or long term leases and therefore not subject to lease expiration or significant future incremental carrying costs 
accordingly  we have a substantial ability to adjust our capital spending as industry circumstances dictate or as opportunities arise 
we have initiated drilling on our operated bakken acreage in the williston basin and our operated eagle ford acreage in texas and our bakken non operated holdings continue to be actively developed 
those projects represent the bulk of our planned capital expenditures for  as set forth in the table below 
however  we may shift our expenditures between geographic areas and projects in an attempt to maximize cash flow and take advantage of regional differences in net commodity prices and service costs or other matters we deem of significance 
while industry circumstances may require us to make capital expenditures adjustments  it is our current intent to accelerate our bakken and eagle ford drilling and further expand our acreage 
to a lesser extent  we intend to drill certain locations in the austin chalk and certain of our prospects on the gulf coast  but those projects could be deferred in favor of increased activity in other areas or so long as low natural gas prices prevail 
the projects  estimated costs and timing of actual expenditures are subject to significant change as we continue to technically and economically evaluate existing and alternative projects  as we further expand our portfolio  and as industry conditions dictate 
estimated expenditures are also subject to significant change 
there can be no assurance that all of the projects identified and summarized in the table below will remain viable and therefore certain projects may be sold or abandoned by us 
however  in the opinion of management  at present  we have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fulfill lease obligations or otherwise maintain all material mineral leases 
our current estimate of our capital expenditure spending for is as follows page

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations 
under this method  costs to acquire oil and gas properties  drill successful exploratory wells  drill and equip development wells  and install production facilities are capitalized 
exploration costs  including unsuccessful exploratory wells  geological  page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements geophysical as well as cost of carrying and retaining unproved properties are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of the capitalized costs associated with proved oil and gas properties are computed using the units of production method  at the field level  based on total proved reserves and proved developed reserves  respectively  as estimated by our independent petroleum engineers 
oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  generally on a field by field basis 
long lived assets committed by management for disposal are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value  less transaction costs 
all of our properties are located within the continental united states and the gulf of mexico 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion  impairment of our oil and natural gas properties  and asset retirement obligations 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and the fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserves information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by our independent petroleum engineers  cawley  gillespie associates  inc the independent petroleum engineers evaluated of our estimated proved reserve quantities and their related future net cash flows as of january  estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
we make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available 
we make changes to depletion rates  impairment calculations  and asset retirement obligations in the same period that changes to reserve estimates are made 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review the value of our oil and gas properties whenever management determines that events and circumstances relating to the significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
this process is performed no less frequently than at the end of each calendar quarter 
impairments of producing properties are determined by comparing the pretax future net undiscounted cash flows to the net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized costs exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined based on expected future cash flows using discounted rates commensurate with the risks involved  using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making relative to acquisitions and divestitures 
during  we recorded impairments of million on proved properties 
these impairments are described in note a organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements consolidated financial statements 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculation of impairment 
the significant assumptions used in the current period s calculation are described in note g fair value disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statement 
we provide for impairments on significant undeveloped properties when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligations aros consist primarily of estimated future costs before considering estimated salvage value associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage  and land restoration in accordance with applicable local  state and federal laws 
the discounted fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas field 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we use hedging to help ensure that we have adequate cash flows to fund our capital expenditure programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based  in part  on our view of current and future market conditions 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
we primarily utilize swaps and costless collars  which are placed with major financial institutions 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivative contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the fair value gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective and is reclassified to oil and gas revenues in our consolidated statements of income in the period that the hedged production is delivered 
hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly based on the relative changes in the fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
our costless collars are valued based on the counterparty s marked to market statements  which are validated by observable transactions for the same or similar commodity options using the nymex futures index 
our swaps are valued based on a discounted future cash flow model 
our primary input for the model is the nymex futures index 
our model is validated by the counterparty s marked to market statements 
the discount rate used in determining the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk 
the values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations each period can be impacted by our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our derivative contracts would not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment  then our consolidated statements of income could include large non cash fluctuations  particularly in volatile pricing environments  as our contracts are marked to their period end market values 
page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
we evaluate the ability of our counterparties to perform at the inception of a hedging relationship and on a periodic basis as appropriate 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
we will consider a tax position settled if the taxing authority has completed its examination  we do not plan to appeal  and it is remote that the taxing authority would reexamine the tax position in the future 
we use the benefit recognition model which contains a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criteria and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  then we will not record the tax benefit 
the amount of interest expense that we recognize related to uncertain tax positions is computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
revenue recognition we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced oil and gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
historically  these differences have been insignificant 
accounting for business combinations our business has grown substantially through acquisitions  and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests acquired are measured at their fair value including the recognition of acquisition related costs and anticipated restructuring costs that are separate from the acquired net assets 
the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is recognized immediately to earnings as a gain from bargain purchase 
certain contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if we can reasonably estimate a fair value during the measurement period 
page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements 
we do not participate in these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements
