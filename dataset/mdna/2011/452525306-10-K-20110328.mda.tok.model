first defense continued to benefit in from wide acceptance by dairy and beef producers as an effective tool to prevent bovine enteritis calf scours 
sales of wipe out dairy wipes increased by during the year ended december  in comparison to we believe that sales growth potential for wipe out dairy wipes is limited because most of our sales of this product tend to be to smaller dairies that are under continued financial pressures that are forcing many small dairy producers out of business and because  while our product is a high quality tool  there are less expensive ways to sanitize a cow prior to milking

our current annual target is to maintain the gross margin percentage at approximately 
a number of factors account for the variability in our costs 
we expect some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter 
the gross margin on first defense is affected by biological yields from our raw material  which do fluctuate over time 
more generally  costs for production of first defense and wipe out dairy wipes have increased due to increased labor costs and expenses associated with our efforts to sustain compliance with cgmp regulations in our production processes 
like most manufacturers in the us  we have been experiencing increases in the cost of raw materials that we purchase 
we have been able to minimize the impact of these cost increases by implementing yield improvements 
product mix also affects gross margin in that we earn a higher gross margin on first defense and a lower gross margin on wipe out dairy wipes 
our inventory balance increased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  this investment was made to help prevent a potential back log of orders 
we have not experienced a back log of orders since the third quarter of we have not implemented significant increases to our selling prices  believing that we could benefit more from higher unit sales volume than through a higher average selling price per unit 
product development expenses product development expenses decreased by  or  to  during the year ended december   as compared to  during we expect higher product development expenses during the year ending december  if a partner agrees to fund the completion of the mast out product development effort  these expenses would be expected to increase even higher  but only if they are off set  in part  by the funds expected to be received from a potential strategic collaboration

the other improvements  extensions  or additions to our current product line include the potential to prevent scours in calves caused by pathogens other than those within the current first defense disease claims e 
coli k and coronavirus such as rotavirus 
we also remain interested in acquiring other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries

at this stage in our development  we have limited our investment in investor relations spending 
we provide a full disclosure of the status of our business and financial condition in three quarterly reports and one annual report each year 
additional information about our business is available in our annual proxy statement 
all of these reports are filed with the sec and are available on line or upon request to the company 
presently  our financial and time resources are committed principally to managing our commercial business and developing mast out 
our board of directors is very involved with and supportive of this resource allocation 
while this strategy of providing cost effective investor relations through our sec reporting is subject to change  we believe that this focus currently is in the best long term interest of all stockholders

we did not increase this authorized limit during or or to date in as of december   we had remaining authorization to spend up to  on capital expenditures  net of  in investments made from january  through december  we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our working capital requirements and to finance our ongoing business operations during at least the next twelve months 
the return of the mast out product rights to us has caused us to increase our spending on product development expenses that had been funded by pfizer from to mid as expected  the expenditures on this program of product development resulted in net losses in  and ending the nine consecutive years of profitability that we recorded through the year ended december  continued development towards regulatory approval of mast out will likely result in a net loss during the first six months of as well 
we believe that our current balance of cash and short term investments is more than sufficient to fund our projected loss and that the commercial prospects for mast out warrant this level of investment 
we expect to return to positive net operating income before other revenues expenses  net and income taxes during the last six months of since  our strategy has been focused on selling and developing products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries 
these product opportunities are generally less expensive to develop than the human health product opportunities that we had worked on during the s

off balance sheet arrangements none critical accounting policies the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 

table of contents immucell corporation we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred

work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates nor currency exchange rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
however  future increases in inflation or interest rates or the value of the us dollar could affect our customers and the demand for our products 
we hedged our interest rate exposure to a  mortgage with an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted a floating interest rate to the fixed rate of 
the interest rate on our  note payable is variable 
if the london interbank offered rate plus exceeds  our interest payments will increase over the current amount 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states 
the cost of our products to international customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
the decline of the us dollar against other currencies could make our products less expensive to international customers 
we do not anticipate that currency fluctuations will significantly affect our sales or the cost of operations
