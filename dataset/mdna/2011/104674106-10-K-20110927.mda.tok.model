table of contents critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates  refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s effective income tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes liabilities when it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the full tax benefit of the position 
the company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 
tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be included in a tax return in different periods than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the income tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the income tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amount of expected future taxable income will not support the use of the deduction or credit 
the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies  and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on an income tax return  but has not yet recognized as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when  based upon the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions 
the company generally re evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when i there is completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
in addition  accounting guidance requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment 
if circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value  the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event 
changes in management s estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
to aid in establishing the value of goodwill and other intangible assets at the time of acquisition  company policy requires that all acquisitions with a purchase price above million require the use of external valuations 

table of contents the company has identified seven reporting units within its three reportable segments 
the company s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year over year basis  the assumptions used in performing the impairment calculations were evaluated in light of market and business conditions 
brady continues to believe that the discounted cash flow model and market multiples model provide a reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company s reporting units 
the projections of future operating results  which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company s current and long range operating plans  are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates  price increases  capital expenditures  working capital levels  income tax rates  the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies  and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to the company s business  loss of significant customers  inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure  and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations 
in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  including goodwill  the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  if necessary  the company may consult valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment would be recorded 
in performing the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its reporting units 
based on the company s fiscal goodwill impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units  the hypothetical fair value of each of the company s reporting units would have been greater than the carrying value
