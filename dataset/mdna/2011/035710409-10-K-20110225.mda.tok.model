item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own  manage  and finance a portfolio of real estate related investments  including mortgage pass through certificates  cmos  agency callable debentures  and other securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our interest earning assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of interest earning assets and from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries offer diversified real estate  asset management and other financial services 
fidac and merganser are our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries that are registered investment advisors that generate advisory and service fee inco me 
rcap is our wholly owned broker dealer taxable reit subsidiary which generates fee income 
we also own an investment fund 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  cmos and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae 
we also invest in federal home loan bank or fhlb  freddie mac and fannie mae debentures 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to high quality rated mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation or s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
in addition  we may directly or indirectly invest part of this remaining of our assets in other types of securities  including without limitation  unrated debt  equity or derivative securities  to the extent consistent with our reit qualification requirements 
the derivative securities in which we invest may include securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  as well as inverse floaters  which may have imbedded leverage as part of their structural characteristics 
we may acquire agency mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  substantially all of the agency mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining our status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as pre payment speeds on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
the table below provides quarterly information regarding our average balances  interest income  yield on assets  average repurchase agreement balances  interest expense  cost of funds  net interest income and net interest rate spreads for the quarterly periods presented 
average investment securities held total interest income yield on average investment securities average balance of repurchase agreements interest expense average cost of funds net interest income net interest rate spread ratios for the quarters have been annualized  dollars in thousands quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  does not reflect unrealized gains losses 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
for the purposes of computing ratios relating to equity measures  throughout this report  equity includes series b preferred stock  which has been treated under gaap as temporary equity 
in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  net income attributable to controlling interest is referred to as net income 
recent developments during the period of market dislocation that began in august  fiscal and monetary policymakers established new liquidity facilities for primary dealers and commercial banks  reduced short term interest rates  and passed legislation intended to address the challenges of mortgage borrowers and lenders 
in september  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed into the conservatorship of the federal housing finance agency  or fhfa  their federal regulator  pursuant to its powers under the federal housing finance regulatory reform act of  a part of the housing and economic recovery act of in addition to fhfa becoming the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  the treasury and fhfa entered into preferred stock purchase agreements pspas between the treasury and fannie mae and freddie mac p ursuant to which the treasury will ensure that each of fannie mae and freddie mac maintains a positive net worth 
on december   the treasury amended the terms of the pspas with fannie mae and freddie mac to remove the billion per institution limit established under the pspas until the end of the treasury also amended the pspas with respect to the requirements for fannie mae and freddie mac to reduce their portfolios 
in  freddie mac and fannie mae began purchasing seriously delinquent mortgage loans out of securities that they currently guarantee 
the loans which they consider seriously delinquent are those loans that are more than days past due 
the repurchases materially impacted the rate of principal prepayments on our agency mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac because of higher premium amortization expense  a decline in higher yielding agency mortgage backed securities assets and an increase in lower yielding investments 
as of december   we had net purchase premiums of billion  or of current par value  on our agency mortgage backed securities 
in addition  the us government  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or federal res erve  and other governmental and regulatory bodies may take other actions in the future to address the financial crisis and recovery from the crisis 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act provides for new regulations on financial institutions and creates new supervisory and advisory bodies  including the new consumer financial protection bureau 
the dodd frank act tasks many agencies with issuing a variety of new regulations  including rules related to mortgage origination and servicing  securitization and derivatives 
because a significant number of regulations under the dodd frank act have either not yet been proposed or not yet been adopted in final form  it is not possible for us to predict how the dodd frank act will impact our business 
on february   the u 
s department of the treasury issued a white paper titled reforming america housing finance market that lays out  among other things  proposals to limit or potentially wind down the role that fannie mae and freddie mac play in the mortgage market 
any such proposals  if enacted  may have broad adverse implications for the mortgage backed securities market and our business  operations and financial condition 
we expect such proposals to be the subject of significant discussion and it is not yet possible to determine whether or when such proposals may be enacted  what form any final legislation or policies might take and how proposals  legislation or policies emanating from the white paper may impact the mortgage backed securities market and our business  operations and fi nancial condition 
we are evaluating the potential impact of the proposals set forth in the white paper 
market conditions are evolving on a number of fronts 
regulatory and technical dynamics continue to develop  and monetary policy initiatives  including additional large scale asset purchases by the federal reserve  continue to support asset prices and lower yields across a wide range of market sectors  including ours 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
fair value of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part our overall management of our portfolio 
accordingly  we are required to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to determine fair values from internal sources and compare them to independent sources 
fair values from internal prices are compared to independent sources for reasonableness 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly b asis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
consideration is given to our intent to sell the investment securities  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery  or whether we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities 
further  the security is analyzed for credit loss the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
the credit loss  if any  will then be recognized in the statement of earnings  while the balance of impairment related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income or oci 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  wall street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
derivative financial instruments hedging activity prior to the fourth quarter of  we designated interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges  whereby the swaps were recorded at fair value on our balance sheet as assets and liabilities with any changes in fair value recorded in oci 
in a cash flow hedge  a swap would exactly match the pricing date of the relevant repurchase agreement 
through the end of the third quarter of we continued to be able to effectively match the swaps with the repurchase agreements therefore entering into effective hedge transactions 
however  due to the volatility of the credit markets  it is no longer practical to match the pricing dates of both the swaps and the repurchase agreements 
as a result  we voluntarily discontinued hedge accounting after the third quarter of through a combination of de designating previously defined hedge relationships and not designating new contracts as cash flow hedges 
the de designation of cash flow hedges requires that the net derivative gain or loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedge should continue to be reported in accumulated oci  unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we continue to hold repurchase agreements in excess of swap contracts and have no indication that interest payments on the hedged repurchase agreements are in jeopardy of discontinuing 
therefore  the deferred losses related to these derivat ives that have been de designated will not be recognized immediately and will remain in oci 
these losses are reclassified into earnings during the contractual terms of the swap agreements starting as of october  changes in the unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate swaps subsequent to september  are reflected in our statement of operations

our net interest income decreased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  because of the decreased interest rate spread 
our net interest rate spread for the year ended december  was  or basis points less than the interest rate spread of for the year ended december  of 
this basis point decrease in interest rate spread for over the spread for was the result of the a decrease in average yield on average interest earning assets of basis points which was only partially offset by the decrease in the average cost of funds of basis points 
our net interest income increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of the increased average asset base of billion in and the increased interest rate spread of basis points

substantially all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties 
substantially all of our mortgage backed securities were freddie mac  fannie mae or ginnie mae mortgage pass through certificates or cmos  which carry an implied aaa rating 
all of our agency debentures are callable and carry an implied aaa rating 
we carry all of our agency mortgage backed securities and agency debentures at fair value 
we carry our corporate debt at amortized cost 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount on interest earning assets and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium on interest earning assets 
at december    and we had on our balance sheet a total of million  million and million  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our on interest earning assets acquired at a price below principal value and a total of billion  billion and million  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our on interest earning assets acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average prepayment speed for the year ended december   and was   and  respectively 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

we invested approximately million in the fund and have redeemed approximately million 
the current assets of the fund still remain at lbie and affiliates of lbie and the ultimate recovery of such amount remains uncertain 
we have entered into the claims resolution agreement between lbie and certain eligible offerees effective december  with respect to these assets or the cra 
certain of our assets subject to the cra are held directly at lbie and we have valued such assets in accordance with the valuation date set forth in the cra and the pricing information provided to us by lbie 
the valuation date with respect to these assets as set forth in the cra is september  certain of our assets subject to the cra are not held directly at lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie 
given the great degree of uncertainty as to the status of our assets that are not directly held by lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie  we have valued such assets at an discount 
the value of the net assets that are not directly held by lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie is determined on the basis of the best information available to us from time to time  legal and professional advice obtained for the purpose of determining the rights  and on the basis of a number of assumptions which we believe to be reasonable 
we can provide no assurance  however  that we will recover all or any portion of any of the net assets of the investment fund following completion of lbie s administration and any subsequent liquidation 
borrowings as of december   our collateralized debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our interest earning assets 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts which we believe are in excess of our needs 
all of our interest earning assets are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity

at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was  with the effect of the interest rate swaps  and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
during the year ended december   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due or the convertible senior notes for net proceeds following underwriting expenses of approximately million 
interest on the convertible senior notes is paid semi annually at a rate of per year and the convertible senior notes will mature on february  unless earlier repurchased or converted 
the convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate at december  of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  which was equivalent to a conversion price at december  of per share of common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional interest earning assets and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies 
our non cash assets are largely actual or implied aaa assets  and accordingly  we have not had  nor do we anticipate having  difficulty in converting our assets to cash 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our interest earning assets could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  convertible senior notes totaled million at december  and there were no convertible senior notes outstanding at december  we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of interest earning assets increases due to changes in market interest rates of market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of our agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such agen cy mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such agency mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our agency mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  interest expense on repurchase agreements  the non cancelable office lease and employment agreements at december  the table does not include the effect of net interest rate payments under our interest rate swap agreements 
the net swap payments will fluctuate based on monthly changes in the receive rate 
at december   the interest rate swaps had a net negative fair value of million 
dollars in thousands contractual obligations within one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total repurchase agreements interest expense on repurchase agreements  based on rates at convertible senior notes interest expense in convertible senior notes long term operating lease obligations employment contracts total stockholders equity on july  we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds following underwriting expenses of approximately billion 
this transaction settled on july  during the year ended december    options were exercised under incentive plan  for an aggregate exercise price of million 
during the year ended december    shares of series b preferred stock were converted into million shares of common stock 
during the year ended december   we raised million by issuing million shares through the direct purchase and dividend reinvestment program 
during the year ended december    options were exercised under incentive plan  for an aggregate exercise price of million 
during the year ended december   we raised million by issuing million shares through our direct purchase and dividend reinvestment program 
during the year ended december   million shares of series b preferred stock converted into million shares of common stock 
unrealized gains and losses with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of the de designation of interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges during the quarter ended december   unrealized gains and losses in our interest rate swaps impact our gaap income 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities and interest rate swaps in our portfolio prior to de designation 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands at december  unrealized gain unrealized loss net unrealized loss gain unrealized changes in the estimated net fair value of available for sale investments have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net fair value of our available for sale investments securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
leverage our debt to equity ratio at december   and was  and  respectively 
we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary  as it currently does because of market conditions  from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion market conditions of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we would cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our agency mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debentures by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors or purchasing interest only securities 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the years ended december  and we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the years ended december   and and for each quarter therein 
consequently  we met the reit income and asset test 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  for the years ended of december    and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests and at least of our assets in qualifying interests plus other real estate related as sets 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the agency mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december  and december   we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
chan ges in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our agency mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors  inverse floaters and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value  should interest rates go up or down  and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
change in interest rate projected percentage change in net interest income projected percentage change in portfolio value  with effect of interest rate swaps basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a n egative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience 
within months months more than year to years years and over total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets mortgage backed securities and agency debentures principal cash equivalents reverse repurchase agreements us treasury securities securities borrowed corporate debt total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities repurchase agreements  with the effect of swaps convertible senior notes us treasury securities sold  not yet purchased securities loaned total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
