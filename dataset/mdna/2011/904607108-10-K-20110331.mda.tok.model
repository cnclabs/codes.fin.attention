item a 
risk factors 
the company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  the outcome of which may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
these risks are as follows changes in general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
the company s revenues and profitability may be impacted by national and local economic conditions  particularly in the state of california 
unfavorable changes in economic conditions such as recessions  increased levels of unemployment and inflation may reduce the company s revenue through policy cancellations  modifications or non renewals 
the recent turmoil in the economy and the disruption in the financial markets may impair the ability of customers to pay premiums as they become due  reduce the amount of coverage that customers may seek and may limit the amount of premiums the company may charge for insurance 
the company is not able to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in the financial markets and adverse economic conditions  both nationally and in the state of california 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on estimates and may not be sufficient to cover future losses 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company 
there is a high level of uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of the required losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for the company 
the long tailed nature of liability claims and the volatility of jury awards exacerbate that uncertainty 
the company sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses 
the ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events  the outcomes of which are affected by many factors 
company claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy  current and perceived social and economic inflation  current and future court rulings and jury attitudes  improvements in medical technology  and many other economic  scientific  legal  political  and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims 
changes in company operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the company s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses  and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulas  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation availability of sufficient reliable data 
incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data 
uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions 
selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies 
adoption of successful pricing strategies 
prediction of policyholder retention eg  policy life expectancy 
unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices 
unexpected inflation 
social changes  particularly those affecting litigation inclinations 
of such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate  or inaccurate data  or inappropriate analyses  assumptions  or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could under price risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s operating results  financial condition  and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
inability to obtain reinsurance or to collect ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses could adversely affect the company s ability to write new policies 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the risk of loss and could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition 
ceded reinsurance does not discharge the company s direct obligations under the policies it writes 
the company remains liable to its policyholders even if the company is unable to make recoveries that it believes it is entitled to under the reinsurance contracts 
losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and legislative changes  which may impact the manner in which the company operates its business 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation by the california department of insurance 
the california department of insurance has broad regulatory powers implemented to protect policyholders  not stockholders or other investors 
these powers include  among other things  the ability to place limitations on the company s investments and dividends 
place limitations on the company s ability to transact business with its affiliates 
establish standards of solvency including minimum reserves and capital surplus requirements 
prescribe the form and content of  and to examine  the company s financial statements 
federal legislation currently does not directly impact the property and casualty business  but the business can be indirectly affected by changes in federal regulations 
in addition  the us congress and other federal agencies from time to time consider whether federal regulation of u 
s 
insurers is necessary 
the company is unable to predict whether such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent this could affect the company 
this extensive regulation may affect the cost or demand for the company s products and may limit the ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that the company might desire to do in order to increase its profitability 
a downgrade in the financial strength rating of the insurance company could reduce the amount of business it may be able to write 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims 
the financial strength rating of am best is subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents  and are not intended for the protection of investors 
any downgrade in the company s am best rating could cause a reduction in the number of policies it writes and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in december of  am best company reaffirmed crusader s financial strength rating of a excellent and a rating outlook of stable 
in addition  crusader was assigned an issuer credit rating of a excellent 
intense competition could adversely affect the ability to sell policies at premium rates the company deems adequate 
the company faces significant competition which  at times  is intense 
if the company is unable to compete effectively  its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition in the property and casualty marketplace is based on many factors including premiums charged  services provided  financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation  perceived financial strength  and general experience 
the company competes with regional and national insurance companies 
some competitors have greater financial  marketing  and management resources than the company 
intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor 
the company uses its own proprietary premium rates to determine the price it charges for its property and casualty policies 
of the company s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates 
investment income is an important component of the company s revenues and net income 
the ability to achieve investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond the company s control 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
any significant decline in investment income as a result of falling interest rates or general market conditions would have an adverse effect on net income and  as a result  on the company s stockholders equity and policyholders surplus 
the outlook for the company s investment income is dependent on the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment 
the fair values of fixed maturity investments that are available for sale fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in stockholders equity 
the company s geographic concentration ties its performance to the business  economic  and regulatory conditions in california 
the company s insurance business is concentrated in california of gross written premium in through 
accordingly  unfavorable business  economic or regulatory conditions in the state of california could negatively impact the company s performance 
in addition  california is exposed to severe natural perils  such as earthquakes and fires  along with the possibility of terrorist acts 
accordingly  the company could suffer losses as a result of catastrophic events 
the company relies on independent insurance agents and brokers 
the failure or inability of independent insurance agents and brokers to market the company s insurance programs successfully could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
independent brokers are not obligated to promote the company s insurance programs and may sell competitors insurance programs 
the company s business largely depends on the marketing efforts of independent brokers and on the company s ability to offer insurance programs and services that meet the requirements of those brokers customers 
the company s reserve for doubtful accounts is based on estimates 
the company may not be able to collect the premiums it estimates is collectible from its agents and brokers and  therefore  the company s reserve for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient 
litigation may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the insurance industry is the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation  some of which involve claims for substantial and or indeterminate amounts and the outcomes of which are unpredictable 
this litigation can be based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices 
although the company has not been the target of any specific class action lawsuits  it is possible that a suit of this type could have a negative impact on the company s business 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability  and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and maintaining its policyholder data 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems or the loss of data contained in the systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs  and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters 
terrorism acts and attacks by computer viruses or hackers 
power loss 
unauthorized access 
computer systems or data network failure 
of it is possible that a system failure  accident  or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized  and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers  and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
the company must hire and train new employees and retain current employees to handle its operations 
the failure of the company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business 
in addition  the failure to adequately staff its claims department could result in decreased quality of the company s claims operations 
the company s success also depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
the company  by virtue of the nature of the business conducted by it  becomes involved in numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either plaintiff or defendant 
incidental actions are sometimes brought by customers or others that relate to disputes concerning the issuance or non issuance of individual insurance policies or other matters

revenue and income generation the company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations  commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations  finance charges and fee income from the premium finance operations  and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation 
the insurance company operation generates approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company

in december of  am best company reaffirmed crusader s financial strength rating of a excellent and a rating outlook of stable 
in addition  crusader was assigned an issuer credit rating of a excellent 
a primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
that is  when pricing its products  the company must forecast the ultimate claim and loss adjustment costs 
in addition  factors such as changes in regulations and legal environment  among other things  can all impact the accuracy of such costs 
of the property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft market conditions  in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is readily available  and by periods of hard market conditions  in which premium rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find  and insurers profits increase 
the company believes that the california property and casualty insurance market continues to be a soft market 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue nor in which direction they might change 
despite the increased competition in the property and casualty marketplace  the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is its primary goal 
nonetheless  crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability by continuing to focus upon three key areas of its operations product development  improved service to retail brokers  and appointment of captive and independent retail agents 
in june  the company completed its search for a new policy administration software system to replace its existing legacy system  and the company signed related contracts on july  the company has concerns about the basis for the vendor s delay in the implementation of the system and about the new system s expected functionality

the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
policy fee income for the months ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in policy fee income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during the months ended december   as compared to of there have been significant changes in the company s health insurance operation in in  approximately of the company s health insurance income was derived from the cigna medical and dental programs 
this represents a decline from in and in in september  cigna substantially reduced the medical plans offered to small group employers in the state of california from plans down to plans 
primarily as a result of cigna s decision to reduce the number of plans offered  aib decided to terminate its marketing and administrative agreement with cigna effective august  on september   aib stopped marketing all cigna products

the insurance premium financing operation currently finances policies written only through its sister company  unifax 
effective july   aac reduced the interest rate charged on premiums financed to in an effort to increase the sales of existing renewal and new business written by unifax for crusader 
due to the low interest rate environment  the cost of money to provide this incentive is not material 
the company monitors the cost of providing this incentive  and depending on the cost benefit determination  can continue to offer it or withdraw it at any time 
primarily due to the interest rate reduction  finance charges and fees earned by aac in decreased as compared to the average premium financed by aac was  in   in and  in the daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by bedford insurance services  inc bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written 
commission in the daily automobile rental insurance program decreased as compared to the decrease in commission income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued and in force during the months ended december   as compared to investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost as of december   and million at amortized cost as of december  investment income for the months ended december   decreased  as compared to the months ended december  the decrease in investment income was primarily due to a decrease in the company s annualized yield on average invested assets to in from in the decrease in the annualized yield on average invested assets is a result of lower yields in the marketplace on both new and reinvested assets 
due to the current interest rate and financial market environment  management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of years or less and with minimal credit risk 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments was years compared to years and years as of december   and december   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
of the increase in net cash used by operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was primarily due to declining written premium and declining commission and fee income 
the decrease in written premium is primarily due to the competitive insurance marketplace 
the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is its primary goal 
the increase in net cash used from operating activities was also attributable to decreased investment income resulting from the lower yields in the marketplace on both new and reinvested assets 
in addition  cash flows can change from period to period depending largely on the amount and the timing of claims payments 
the variability of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses is primarily due to its small population of claims which may result in greater fluctuations in claim frequency and or severity 
as of december   the company had only open claims 
although the consolidated statements of cash flows continue to reflect net cash used by operating activities  the company continues to be profitable  well capitalized  and adequately reserved  and it does not anticipate future liquidity problems 
as of december   all of the company s investments are in us treasury securities  fdic insured certificates of deposit and money market funds which are readily marketable 
the weighted average maturity of the company s investments is approximately years 
the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company is adverse development of the insurance company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be sufficient 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments 
cash and investments at amortized cost of the company at december   were  compared to  at december  crusader cash and investments at december   and december   were of the total cash and investments held by the company 
the company investments are as follows december  december  amount amount fixed maturities at amortized cost certificates of deposit us treasury securities industrial and miscellaneous taxable total fixed maturity investments short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit bank money market accounts us government money market fund short term us treasury bills bank savings accounts total short term cash investments total investments the company is required to classify its investment securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading securities 
although all of the company investment in fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and while the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
the company s investment guidelines on equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of  the company s investment guidelines on fixed maturities limit those investments to high grade obligations with a maximum term of years 
the maximum investment authorized in any one issuer is  this dollar limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and us government or us government guaranteed issues 
when the company invests in fixed maturity municipal securities  preference is given to issues that are pre refunded and secured by us treasury securities 
the short term investments are either us government obligations  fdic insured  or are in an institution with a moody rating of p and or a standard poor rating of a all of the company fixed maturity investment securities are rated  readily marketable  and could be liquidated without any materially adverse financial impact 
of the investment marketplace in general  and in certain asset classes specifically  has been impacted by volatility as a result of uncertainty in the credit markets that began in and continued throughout the company s fixed maturity amortized cost investment portfolio as of december   consisted of us treasury securities and certificates of deposit 
crusader statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  a decrease of  less than from december  crusader statutory capital and surplus as of december   was  a decrease of  from december  in the years ending december  and  crusader issued cash dividends of  and  respectively  to unico  its parent and sole shareholder 
these dividends were primarily used to fund the cash dividends paid by unico to its shareholders  to repurchase and retire shares of unico common stock and for general corporate purposes 
no dividends were declared or paid by crusader to unico in based on crusader s statutory surplus for the year ended december   the maximum dividend that could be made by crusader to unico without prior regulatory approval in is on december   the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share payable on december   to shareholders of record on december  declaration of future cash dividends will be subject to the company s profitability and its cash requirements 
on december   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire from time to time up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
this program has no expiration date and may be terminated by the board of directors at any time 
during the year ended december   the company did not repurchase any stock under this program 
as of december   the company had remaining authority under the program to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of its common stock 
the program is the only program under which there is remaining authority to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
the company has retired all stock repurchased 
although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings  the company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end  net of statutory deposits of  and california insurance company statutory dividend restrictions applicable to crusader plus the cash to be generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next months without the necessity of borrowing funds 
there were no trust restrictions on cash and short term investments at december  as a california insurance company  crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that crusader is admitted 
premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes 
the company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows contractual obligations total within year years years after years building lease loss and loss adjustment expense reserves total unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates 
of results of operations general total revenue for the year ended december   was   for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of  for the year compared to the year and  for the year compared to the year 
the company had net income of  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of  for the year compared to the year  and a decrease of  for the year compared to the year 
for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  in income before taxes 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit  a decrease of  in investment income and a decrease in other insurance revenues of  which were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses of  for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  in income before taxes 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting profit  and a decrease of  in investment income 
the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the years ended december    and was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium net written premium net of reinsurance ceded earned premium before reinsurance ceded earned premium net of reinsurance ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses crusader s primary line of business is commercial multi peril policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for the years ended december    and as of december   crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of arizona  california  nevada  oregon  and washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in other states 
of premiums premium written before reinsurance is a non gaap financial measure which is defined  under statutory accounting  as the contractually determined amount charged by the company to the policyholder for the effective period of the contract based on the expectation of risk  policy benefits  and expenses associated with the coverage provided by the terms of the policies 
premiums written is a required statutory measure designed to determine written premium production levels 
premium earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
for the year ended december   gross written premium as reported on the company s statutory statement was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  
for the year ended december   gross written premium was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  
the decrease in written premium in both and reflected heightened competition  weak economic growth and management s continued emphasis on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline 
in addition to the increased competition in the market place and the effects of the slow economic recovery in california  the company took corrective action in on two of its problematic programs that were contributing higher than expected losses 
this action resulted in reducing the number of brokers authorized to write that particular program from to these two programs accounted for approximately of the  decrease in written premium before reinsurance in the current year 
this action reinforces the company s belief that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is its primary goal 
the insurance marketplace continues to be intensely competitive as more insurers are competing for the same customers 
the company believes that california s commercial property and casualty marketplace continues to be in a soft market 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market condition will continue  nor in which direction it might change 
while crusader attempts to meet such competition with competitive prices  its emphasis is on service  promotion  and distribution 
crusader believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is its primary goal 
nonetheless  crusader believes that it can grow its sales and profitability by continuing to focus upon three key areas of its operations product development  improved service to retail brokers  and appointment of captive and independent retail agents 
during  crusader continued to introduce product changes such as to its rates  eligibility guidelines  rules and coverage forms 
improved service is primarily focused upon transacting business through the internet  as well as providing more options to make the agents and brokers time more efficiently spent with crusader ie  as opposed to spending time with crusader s competitors 
as of december   crusader had appointed retail agents 
presently  it is expected that each such retail agent should be able to reach an annual sales volume of approximately one to two million dollars of crusader s products within three to five years of their appointment by crusader 
however  crusader does not intend to substantially increase its number of retail agents appointed until the company implements a new policy administration software system 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
in the year ended december   premium earned before reinsurance decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended december  in the year ended december   premium earned before reinsurance decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in earned premium before reinsurance in both and is a direct result of the decrease in written premium in and  respectively 
earned ceded premium for the months ended december   decreased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premium for the months ended december   increased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were in  in  and for the company evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance contracts at its inception to determine if there is a sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature 
as of december   all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance 
the earned premium ceded consists of both premium ceded under the company s current reinsurance contracts and premium ceded to the company s provisionally rated reinsurance contracts

crusader s and st layer primary excess of loss treaties provide for a contingent commission to the company equal to of the net profit  if any  accruing to the reinsurer 
the first accounting period for the contingent commission covers the period from january   through december  for each accounting period as described above  the company will calculate and report to the reinsurers its net profit excluding incurred but not reported losses  if any  within days after months following the end of the first accounting period  and within days after the end of each month period thereafter until all losses subject to the agreement have been finally settled 
any contingent commission received is subject to return based on future development of ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   the company has received a total net contingent commission of  for the years subject to contingent commission 
of this amount  the company has recognized  of contingent commission income  of which  was recognized in the year ended december  the remaining balance of the net payments received of  is currently unearned and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the unearned contingent commission may be subsequently earned or returned to the reinsurer depending on the future development of the ceded ibnr for the years subject to contingent commission 
crusader s direct  ceded and net earned premium are as follows year ended december direct earned premium earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium provisionally rated ceded premium total earned ceded premium net earned premium ratios of earned ceded premium to direct earned premium the changes in the ratio of earned ceded premium to direct earned premium is primarily due to changes in ceded reinsurance rates charged by reinsurers and changes in the level of crusader s participation 
losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss ratio are as follows year ended december net earned premium net losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for events of prior years total net losses and loss adjustment expenses loss ratio expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined based on earned premiums 
the portion of the premium dollar expected to pay claims costs is referred to as the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
the company s emerging loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for each accident year are reviewed in detail at the end of each quarter as part of the reserve diagnostics testing 
of the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as indicated in the above table  the loss ratio for the year ended december   increased to from in and in the increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to an increase in the provision for insured events of the current year as a percent of net earned premium 
the increase in current accident year losses was primarily a result of problems with one of the company s new programs 
the company s sales in that program  which include both property and liability coverages  began in july the company took immediate corrective action on that program which included non renewal of a substantial number of policies written in that program and is reflected in the reduction of written premium in the company took further action in the third quarter of by reducing the number of brokers authorized to write that particular program from to the company will non renew the annual polices written by the brokers that are no longer authorized to write that program 
these actions are expected to ultimately improve the company s loss ratio for that program 
for the year ended december   the provision for insured events of the current year as a percent of net earned premium was as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december   respectively 
the company s net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the calendar years ended december   december  and december   were   and  respectively 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
the favorable adverse development by accident year is as follows years ended december  december  december  accident year favorable adverse development of total favorable adverse development of total favorable adverse development of total prior to total prior accident years as reflected in the above table  the amount of favorable development recognized during the year ended december   increased  to  from  in the amount of favorable development recognized during the year ended december   increased  to  from  in the favorable development in the above table is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 
of any reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses from redundancies in the company s december   reserves over actual future payments  and or any additional losses and loss adjustment expenses from actual future payments that exceed the company s reserves  will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations of future accounting periods 
the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption closely approximates the company s historical average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
the difference between the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption and the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for a given accident year will ultimately result in a dollar change either higher or lower that is a multiple of the earned premium for that year 
the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within five percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in of the company s years 
since the company s net earned premium in was  a difference between the accident year actual and current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios of only five percentage points will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within ten percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in of the company s years 
a difference of ten percentage points on accident year will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within twenty percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in of the company s years 
a twenty percentage point difference between the accident year actual and the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  in addition  accident years and prior are also still developing 
future development on those years might either offset or add to any future development that emerges on accident year reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves consists of case reserves and reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
case reserves are established by claims personnel based on a review of the facts known at the time the claim is reported and are subsequently revised as more information about a claim becomes known 
ibnr is computed using various actuarial methods and techniques and includes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported to the company  and a provision for expected future development on case reserves for information not currently known 
the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are as follows year ended december direct reserves case reserves ibnr reserves total direct reserves reserves net of reinsurance case reserves ibnr reserves total net reserves reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of crusader s lines of business were as follows year ended december line of business cmp other liability other total the company s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for both reported and unreported claims of the insurance company operation 
the company sets these reserves at each quarterly balance sheet date based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date  for both reported and unreported claims 
of analysis of the roll forward of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of crusader s losses and loss adjustment expenses  including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated year ended december reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year decrease in provision for events of prior years total losses and loss adjustment expenses payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years total payments reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet  gross of reinsurance the company s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve was  as of december  since underwriting profit is a significant part of income  a small percentage change in reserve estimates may result in a substantial effect on future reported earnings 
such changes might result from a variety of factors  including claims costs emerging in a different pattern than the average historical development patterns 
considering the continuum of possible development patterns  none of which is necessarily more or less likely than the next  the company must consider the varying probabilities that the development pattern is off in varying degrees 
if future development ultimately ends up being five percent different than the company s net reserve  approximately million would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
a variance of five percent of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve is not an unlikely scenario 
if future development ultimately ends up being ten percent different than the company s net reserve  approximately million would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
a variance of ten percent of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve is not an unlikely scenario 
differences of more than ten percent are also possible  though not quite as likely as differences of ten percent or less 
other insurance operations health insurance program commission income from the health insurance sales is as follows year ended december commission income of aib markets health insurance in california through non affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups 
for these services  aib receives commission based on the premiums that it writes 
commission income for the year ended december   decreased  compared to the year ended december  commission income for the year ended december   decreased   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in commission income in and is primarily due to the decrease in commission income from the sales of cigna medical and dental plans 
there had been significant changes in the company s health insurance operation in in  approximately of the company s health insurance income was derived from the cigna medical and dental programs 
this represents a decline from in and in in september  cigna substantially reduced the medical plans offered to small group employers in the state of california from plans down to plans 
primarily as a result of cigna s decision to reduce the number of plans offered  aib decided to terminate its marketing and administrative agreement with cigna effective august  on september   aib stopped marketing all cigna products 
aaqhc  an administrator  ceased administration of cigna dental plans effective november  and cigna medical plans effective december  the termination of the marketing and administrative agreement with cigna has resulted in a decrease in aib commission income and aaqhc fee income 
aib is assisting the aaqhc members in obtaining medical and dental coverage with other contracted carriers 
these carriers are paying aib commissions for these members 
aib has developed a new partnership with guardian life insurance company of america glic 
effective october   aib has been marketing glic s dental and group life products to both brokers and the public

the decrease in is also due to the termination of the administrative agreement with cigna also discussed above 
policy fee income unifax sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
unifax also receives non refundable policy fee income that is directly related to the crusader policies it sells 
for financial statement reporting purposes  policy fees are earned ratably over the life of the related insurance policy 
the unearned portion of the policy fee is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet under accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the earned portion of the policy fee charged to the policyholder by unifax is recognized as income in the consolidated financial statements 
unifax s policy fee income is as follows year ended december policy fee income policies issued policy fee income for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in policy fee income is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during as compared to policy fee income for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in policy fee income is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during as compared to of daily automobile rental insurance program the daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by bedford for a non affiliated insurance company

the daily automobile rental insurance program continues to be impacted by the intense price competition in the marketplace and the slow economic recovery during the periods covered by this report 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
to avoid underwriting losses for the non affiliated insurance company that it represents  bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes to be adequate

premium finance program premium finance charges and late fees earned from financing policies are as follows year ended december premium finance charges and fees earned new loans the insurance premium financing operation currently finances policies written only through its sister company  unifax 
consequently  aac s growth is primarily dependent on the growth of crusader and unifax business 
effective july   aac reduced the interest rate charged on premiums financed to in an effort to increase the sales of existing renewal and new business written by unifax for crusader 
due to the low interest rate environment  the cost of money to provide this incentive is not material 
the company monitors the cost of providing this incentive  and depending on the cost benefit determination  can continue to offer it or withdraw it at any time 
primarily due to the financing  premium finance charges and fees earned decreased  in the year ended december   compared to premium finance charges and fees earned decreased  in the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to the fact that there were fewer loans issued during the year

due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of years or less and with minimal credit risk 
thus  the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments as of december   was years compared to years as of december  the company s invested assets at amortized value as of december   were  as compared to  as of december  in the year ended december   the company s average invested assets at amortized value decreased  compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   investment income earned  excluding realized gains  decreased  compared to the year ended december  the yield on average invested assets decreased to in from in the decrease in the yield on average invested assets is primarily the result of a decrease in the average return on new and reinvested assets in the company s investment portfolio

no securities were sold at a loss during or the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments 
the company does not have the intent to sell its fixed maturity investments  and it is not likely that the company would be required to sell any of its fixed maturity investments prior to recovery of its amortized costs 
the company did not sell any fixed maturity investments in the years ended december  and the company sold one fixed maturity investment in the year ended december   with net realized gain in the amount of  operating expenses policy acquisition costs are as follows year ended december policy acquisition costs ratio to net earned premium gaap ratio policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  premium taxes  inspection fees  and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the production of crusader insurance policies 
these costs include both crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other unico subsidiaries 
on certain reinsurance treaties  crusader receives a ceding commission from its reinsurer that represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to the premium ceded 
no ceding commission is received on facultative  catastrophe  or provisionally rated ceded premium 
policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
no significant change in the ratio of policy acquisition cost to net earned premium were noted in the years ended december   and salaries and employee benefits are as follows year ended december total salaries and employee benefits incurred less charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses less capitalized to policy acquisition costs net amount charged to operating expenses of total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   decreased  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in total salaries and employee benefits incurred is primarily the result of a decrease in the number of employees as compared to the prior year and the retirement of the former chief executive of the company on april   and the effect of the adjustment on the quarter ended march   to reduce the company s annual contribution to the employee profit sharing plan for the plan year ending march   by approximately  see note 
total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   decreased  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in total salaries and employee benefits incurred is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of employees as compared to the prior period  the retirement of the former chief executive of the company on april   and was offset by increases in general salaries and employee benefits costs 
commissions to agents brokers are as follows year ended december commission to agents brokers commissions to agents brokers not including commissions on crusader policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs are generally related to gross commission income from the health insurance program  the daily automobile rental insurance program  and the earthquake program 
commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in written premium in the health insurance program and the decrease in commission income from that program 
commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in written premium in the health insurance program and the decrease in commission income from that program 
other operating expenses are as follows year ended december other operating expenses other operating expenses generally do not change significantly with changes in production 
this is true for both increases and decreases in production 
other operating expenses decreased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses is primarily due to a decrease in the company s bad debt expense  general corporate legal expenses and costs related to the california department of insurance required tri annual examination of the company s insurance subsidiary that was ongoing in other operating expenses increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the company s bad debt expense increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and legal fees increased  as compared to december   primarily due to a single agent s failure to remit premiums due unifax

income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
this decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in pre tax income to  in the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of  in the year ended december   and to the recognition of a decrease in the percentage of undistributed dividends subject to california franchise tax that reduced the company s deferred tax liability by approximately  excluding the adjustment to the deferred tax expense  the effective tax rate would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to tax adjustments  recorded in the months ended december   related to prior periods which reduced the company s income tax expense in the current year by  the adjustment was the result of recognition of the tax effect of certain deferred items for state income tax purposes 
the pre tax income decreased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   which resulted in a decreased income tax expense in recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued a new standard to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
costs that meet the definition defined in the new standard are recognized as assets and referred to as deferred acquisition costs 
deferred acquisition costs are amortized over time using amortization methods dependent upon the nature of the underlying insurance product 
other costs that do not vary with and are not primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts are charged to expense as incurred 
the new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued a new standard related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which amends the earlier fasb standard to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and fair value measurements and requires separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to level fair value measurements 
the new standard also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value 
the company adopted the new accounting standard which became effective for the interim reporting period ended march   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no other accounting standards issued during that are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves 
management makes its best estimate of the liability for unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the company s unpaid claims costs  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments may vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  especially for a small insurer like the company 
for any given line of insurance  accident year  or other group of claims  there is a continuum of possible reserve estimates  each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness 
due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process  there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios 
the company does not specifically identify reasonably likely scenarios other than utilizing management s best estimate 
in addition to applying the various standard methods to the data  an extensive series of diagnostic tests are applied to the resultant reserve estimates to determine management s best estimate of the unpaid claims liability 
among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns  frequencies expected claim counts  severities average cost per claim  loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to premium  and loss adjustment expense ratios to loss 
when there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year  the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly 
of some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as long tail lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled 
lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called short tail lines 
it is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long tail lines because of the long period of time that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim 
the company s short tail lines consist of its property coverages and its long tail lines consist of its liability coverages 
however  compared to other long tail liability lines that are not underwritten by the company  such as workers compensation  professional liability  umbrella liability  and medical malpractice  the company s liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker 
the company underwrites four statutory annual statement lines of business commercial multi peril  liability other than automobile and products  fire  and allied lines 
commercial multi peril policies comprised of the company s  and premium volume 
commercial multi peril policies include both property and liability coverages 
for all of the company s coverages and lines of business  the company s actuarial loss and loss adjustment expense reserving methods require assumptions that can be grouped into two key categories expected losses and loss adjustment expenses required by the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods  and expected development patterns required by the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the company also segregates most of its business into smaller homogeneous categories primarily for management s internal detailed business review and analysis 
these homogeneous categories used by the company include various combinations and special groupings of its lines of business  programs types  states  and coverages 
some categories exclude certain items and or others include certain items 
not all categories are defined in the same way 
this analysis includes the tracking of historical claims costs and development patterns separately for each of these uniquely designed categories 
generally  neither the liability development patterns nor the property development patterns vary significantly by category 
the accurate establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on the company s current and historical accident year claims data  including but not limited to reported claim counts  open claim counts  closed claim counts  closed claim counts with payments  paid losses  paid loss adjustment expenses  case loss reserves  case loss adjustment expense reserves  earned premiums and policy exposures  salvage and subrogation  and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid 
many other factors  including changes in reinsurance  changes in pricing  changes in policy forms and coverage  changes in underwriting and risk selection  legislative changes  results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company s reserves are re evaluated for each accident year ie  for all claims incurred within each year by a committee consisting of the company s president and the company s chief financial officer 
it is also reviewed by an independent consulting actuary 
the company uses the loss ratio method  bornhuetter ferguson methods and loss development methods to estimate ultimate claims costs 
in general the loss ratio method is more appropriate for the current accident year  the loss development methods are more appropriate for the older more mature accident years  and the bornhuetter ferguson methods combine the other two methods 
the estimates of the loss ratio method and the bornhuetter ferguson incurred method have not been significantly different on the current accident year at recent valuation dates through during the actual emerged claims cost for the current accident year are higher than expected  hence the incurred but not reported ibnr estimate from bornhuetter ferguson incurred method is greater than the ibnr estimate from the loss ratio method 
management reviews such differences to determine whether they are aberrations that are a normal part of the process or an indication that a change in reserve assumptions is appropriate 
in this case management has recognized the adverse experience observed in as one of the normal differences between actual and expected claim costs that can emerge from time to time  particularly in an insurer the size of the company and does not believe a that a change in assumptions to estimate the ultimate claims costs for the current accident year to be appropriate 
of development patterns generally do not tend to change materially over time 
generally  the company has very little property claim development subsequent to the end of an accident year 
although liability claims may take or more years to fully develop  most of the development occurs in the first to years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
however  liability claims are substantially developed by years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
the company s reserving methodology assumptions have not changed in the years presented 
the effect of losses and loss adjustment expenses on the company s financial statements has primarily resulted from estimated costs being adjusted as actual costs emerge 
the estimate of the total ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense for a given accident year is revised over time as actual costs emerge 
this is not  however a revision of the company s estimates  but a gradual replacement over time of the prior cost estimates with actual cost estimates with actual costs as they emerge 
this is normal unfolding of loss development process  not a revision of cost estimates 
the company s actuarially based loss and loss adjustment expense reserve methodology does not include an implicit or explicit provision for uncertainty 
insurance claims costs are inherently uncertain 
there is not a precise means of quantifying a provision for uncertainty when determining an appropriate liability for unpaid claims costs 
rather  the potential for claims costs being less than estimated and the potential for claims costs being more than estimated are considered when selecting the parameters to be used in the application of the actuarial methods and when testing the estimates for reasonableness 
management believes that its recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves make reasonable provision for its liability for unpaid claims costs 
the information that management uses to arrive at its best reserve estimate comes from many sources within the company  including its accounting  legal  claims  and underwriting departments 
informed managerial judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
the company must estimate its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using a very small claim population size 
at the beginning of  the company had open claim files 
during   new claim files were opened and  claim files were closed  leaving open claim files at the end of due to the small size of the company and the related small population of claims  the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses for any accident year can vary significantly from the initial expectations 
due to the small number of claims  changes in claim frequency and or severity can materially affect the company s reserve estimate 
the potential variability from management s best estimate cannot be measured from any meaningful statistical basis due to the numerous uncertainties in the claims reserving process and the small population of claims 
at each quarterly review  actual claims costs that emerge are compared with the claims costs that were expected to emerge during that development period 
sometimes the previous claims costs estimates prove to have been too high  sometimes they prove to have been too low 
in the case of the company  the estimates proved to be too high in each of the years reflected in the table 
the favorable development in through underscores the inherent uncertainty in insurance claims costs  especially for a very small insurer 
calendar year ended december net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net decrease in provision for events of prior years percent of favorable development to beginning reserves of the differences between actual and expected claims costs are typically not due to one specific factor but to a combination of many factors such as the period of time between the initial occurrence and the final settlement of the claim  current and perceived social and economic inflation  and many other economic  legal  political  and social factors 
because of these and other factors  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
there have been no changes in key assumptions of estimating future loss and loss adjustment payments 
the changes in estimates of prior accident year incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are attributed to the passage of time and the greater amount of actual loss data available for each accident year 
reinsurance the company s recoverable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments that will be recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
these estimates are based upon estimates of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that the company expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses  the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the company s estimate of the amounts recoverable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
the company s assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts recoverable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
the company evaluates each of its ceded reinsurance contracts at its inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature 
at december   all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance 
the following tables provide the effect of reinsurance on the company s financial statements the effect of reinsurance on financial position is as follows year ended december ceded loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable on excess of loss treaties ceded case loss and loss adjustment expense reserves recoverable ceded ibnr reserves recoverable total ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves recoverable the effect of reinsurance on the results of operations is as follows the effect of reinsurance on earned premium is as follows year ended december direct earned premium earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium provisionally rated ceded premium total earned ceded premium net premiums earned ratio of earned ceded premium to direct earned premium of the effect of reinsurance on losses and loss adjustment expenses are as follows year ended december direct losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on excess of loss treaties ceded paid losses and loss adjustment expenses change in ceded case loss reserves change in ceded ibnr reserves total ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred net losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded premium and ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses are as follows year ended december earned ceded premium ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred ceded earned premium less ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred the effect of reinsurance on cash flow is as follows year ended december changes in reinsurance recoverable from statements of cash flows there were no catastrophe losses incurred during the period covered by this table 
there have been no changes in key assumptions of estimating future ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the changes in estimates of prior accident year ceded incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are attributed to the passage of time and greater amount of actual loss data available for each accident year 
the company s reinsurance strategy is to reduce volatility in its expected loss and loss adjustment expense results by protecting the company against liabilities in excess of certain retentions  including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which it insures 
on an annual basis  or sooner if warranted  the company evaluates whether any changes to its retention  participation  or retained limits are necessary 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are determined separately on both a direct basis and a net of reinsurance basis  and the ceded reserves are determined by subtraction 
therefore  reinsurance recoverable is determined in a manner consistent with the associated loss reserves 
there have been no recent changes in key assumptions underlying the estimation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  and no changes are anticipated 
paid losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded are determined by the terms of the individual treaties 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of reinsurance recoverable to determine if any allowance is necessary 
the company currently only writes business in the state of california 
the types of businesses and the coverage limits written by the company are not considered difficult lines for obtaining reinsurance 
in addition  because the major catastrophe exposure is primarily from riots and from fire following earthquakes  the company does not anticipate significant limitations on its ability to cede future losses on a basis consistent with its historical results 
of investments the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value 
although all of the company investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in the value of a fixed maturity is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and  consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit over year at cost total invested assets the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the company s unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes of  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately  this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold or the decrease was deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
