we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results m ay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation allowances  sales returns and warranty liability  the useful life of property and equipment  stock based compensation expense and income taxes 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably may have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenue is derived from sales of our products through our indirect channel including retailers and distributors and through our direct channel including www 
zagg 
com and our corporate owned and third party owned mall kiosks  and from the fees derived from the sale of exclusive independent distributor licenses related to the kiosk program 
for sales of product  our standard shipping terms are fob shipping point and we record revenue when the product is shipped  net of estimated returns and discounts 
for some customers  the contractual shippin g terms are fob destination  for these shipments  we record revenue when the product is delivered  net of estimated returns and discounts 
for license fees  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the license term 
promotional products given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a cost of sales 
cash incentives provided to our customers are recognized as a reduction of the related sale price  and  therefore  are a reduction in sales 
reserve for sales returns and warranty liability for product sales  the company records revenue  net of estimated returns and discounts  when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
our return policy generally allows its end users and retailers to return purchased products for refund or in exchange for new products within days of end user purchase 
in addition  the company generally provides the ultimate consumer a warranty with each product 
due to the nature of the invisibleshield product line  returns are generally not salvageable and are not included in inventory 
we estimate a reserve for sales returns and warranty and record the estimated reserve amount as a reductio n of sales and as a sales return reserve liability 
the estimate for sales returns and warranty requires management to make significant estimates regarding return rates for sales and warranty returns 
historical experience  actual claims  and customer return rights are the key factors used in determining the estimated sales return and warranty reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectability of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and to compare these with current inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to the estimated net realizable value thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
the determination of the realization of certain income tax positions is subject to significant estimates based upon the facts and circumstances of each position 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary which involves judgment related to future cash flows and the application of the appropriate valuation model 
if fore casts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for awards granted to employees and non employees under its stock incentive plan  which include restricted stock and stock options 
equity classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is measured on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model bsm  which involves the use of assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free rate 
volatility is a key factor used to determine the fair value of stock options in the bsm 
the company does not have sufficient historical data or implied volatility information to determine volatility based upon its own information 
therefore the company uses signif icant judgment to identify a peer group and determine the appropriate weighting in order to estimate a volatility rate for use in the bsm

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
to date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial  although there can be no guarantee that these market risks will be immaterial to us 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our financing facilities and capital structure 
market risk  calculated as the potential change in fair value of our cash equivalents and line of credit resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  was not material at december
