real estate lending primarily includes both variable and adjustable rate products 
loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward immediately based on changes in the loan s index  normally prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
rates on adjustable rate loans move upward or downward after an initial fixed term of normally one  three  or five years 
rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans are made annually after the initial fixed term expires and are indexed mainly to shorter term treasury indexes 
generally  variable and adjustable rate loans contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases over the life of the loan of up to basis points and lifetime floors of basis points 
in addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments  loans secured by residential real estate typically contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of basis points 
there is typically no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate 
the company also makes fixed rate commercial real estate loans to a lesser extent with repayment terms generally not exceeding months

other commercial loans are asset based loans secured by equipment and lines of credit secured by receivables and include lending across a diverse range of business types 
commercial lending and real estate construction lending  including commercial leasing  generally includes a higher degree of credit risk than other loans  such as residential mortgage loans 
commercial loans  like other loans  are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements 
collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower s financial strength  the terms and amount of the loan  and collateral available to secure the loan 
credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower 
credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan s outstanding balance 
for construction loans  inaccurate initial estimates of a project s costs and the property s completed value could weaken the company s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property 
secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles  boats  and other motor vehicles 
in most cases loans are restricted to the subsidiaries general market area 
loan policy the company has a company wide lending policy in place that is amended and approved from time to time as needed to reflect current economic conditions and product offerings in its markets

as an example  the loan to value limits contained within the policy were reduced during due to the declining economy and the attendant real estate market decline 
while new appraisals now reflect that decline  appraisal reviews and downward adjustments are a continuing area of focus to reduce credit risk 
the lending policy is evaluated for underwriting criteria by the company s internal audit department in its loan review capacity as well as by regulatory authorities 
suggested revisions from these groups are taken into account  analyzed  and implemented by management where improvements are warranted 
the company s subsidiary banks may amend their lending policy so long as the amendment is no less stringent than the company wide lending policy 
these amendments are done within the control structure and oversight of the parent company

procedures the lending policy lists the products and credit services offered by each of the company s subsidiary banks 
each product and service has an established written procedure to adhere to when transacting business with a customer 
the lending policy also establishes pre determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience 
further  the policy establishes committees to review and approve or deny credit requests at various lending amounts 
this includes subcommittees of the bank boards of directors and  at certain lending levels  the entire bank board 
generally  for loans in excess of million  the bank subsidiaries full board of directors will be presented with the loan request 
this only occurs when the credit has first been recommended by the loan officer and chief credit officer  and then by the directors loan committee 
when loan requests are within policy guidelines and the amount requested is within their lending authority  lenders are permitted to approve and close the transaction 
a review of the loan file and documentation takes place within days to ensure policy and procedures are being followed 
approval authorities are under regular review for adjustment by affiliate management and the parent company

hybrid loans include payment option adjustable rate mortgages arm s  negative amortization loans  and stated income stated asset loans 
appraisals the value of real estate in the company s markets has generally declined as a result of the economic downturn beginning in net charge offs have been negatively impacted by slower sales and excess inventory related to loans secured by real estate developments 
the slower sales and excess inventory has decreased the cash flow and financial prospects of many borrowers  particularly those in the real estate development and related industries and reduced the estimated fair value of the collateral securing these loans 
the company uses independent third party state certified or licensed appraisers 
these appraisers take into account local market conditions when preparing their estimate of fair value 
however  management of the company will often include refinements in the appraised value for estimated costs to sell as required under relevant accounting standards 
the company evaluates appraisals it receives from independent third parties subsequent to the appraisal date by monitoring transactions in its markets and comparing them to its projects that are similar in nature 
the company s internal audit department periodically reviews appraisals on a test basis to determine that assumptions used in appraisals remain valid and are not stale 
new appraisals are obtained if market conditions significantly impact collateral values for those loans that are identified as impaired 
internal audit reviews appraisals related to all of the company s impaired loans and repossessed properties at least annually 
the company considers appraisals it receives on one property as a means to extrapolate the estimated value for other collateral of similar characteristics if that property may not otherwise have a need for an appraisal 
should a borrower s financial condition continue to deteriorate  an updated appraisal on that specific collateral will be obtained 
appraisals obtained for construction and development lending purposes are performed by state licensed or state certified appraisers who are credentialed and on the company s approved list 
plans and specifications are provided to the appraiser by bank personnel not directly involved in the credit approval process 
the appraisals conform to the standards of appraisal practices established by the appraisal standards board in effect at the time of the appraisal 
this includes net present value accounting for construction and development loans on an as completed basis 
appraisal reviews are conducted internally by bank personnel familiar with the local market and who are not directly involved in the credit approval process 
bank personnel do not increase the valuation from the appraisal but may  in some instances  make a reduction 
upon completion  a follow up site visit by the appraiser is completed to verify the property was improved per the original plans and specifications and recertify  if appropriate  the original estimate of as completed market value 
there are two circumstances where management may make adjustments to appraisals as discussed above  construction and development appraisals are on an as completed basis 
if work remains to be completed on a financed project  management will reduce the estimated value in the appraisal by the cost estimated to complete the work and  if required by the loan balance  establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan based on the need to complete such work 
if an appraisal for given collateral is still valid eg less than one year old  etc  but due to market conditions and the bank s familiarity with comparable property sales in the market the appraised value appears high  management may adjust downward from the last appraisal its estimate of the value of the collateral and  in turn  establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan to reflect this downward adjustment 
loan to value ratios are typically well under at inception which gives the company a cushion as collateral values fall 
however  when updated appraisals reveal collateral exposure ie the value of the collateral is less than originally estimated and no longer supports the loan balance  negotiations ensue with the borrower aimed at providing additional collateral support for the credit 
this may be in many forms as determined by the financial holdings of the borrower 
if not available  third party support for the credit is pursued eg  guarantors  equity investors 
if negotiations fail to provide additional adequate collateral support  reserves are allocated to the loan or the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated costs to sell 
when a construction loan or development loan is downgraded  a new appraisal is ordered contemporaneously with the downgrade 
the appraisers are instructed to give a fair value based upon both an as is basis and an as completed basis 
the twofold purpose is to facilitate management s decision making process in determining the cost benefits of completing a project vs 
marketing the project as is 
the carrying value of a downgraded loan or non performing asset wherein the underlying collateral is an incomplete project is based on a fresh appraisal at the as is value 
the current appraisal is a compilation of the most recent sales available and therefore includes the risk premium established by the market conditions 
when the comparable sales are not deemed to be reliable or the adjustments are not satisfactory  management will make appropriate adjustments to the fair value which includes a risk premium discount deducted using the discounted cash flow framework 
the reserve or write down is expended upon completion of the appraisal and other relevant information assessment 
interest reserves interest reserves represent funds loaned to a borrower for the payment of interest during the development phase on certain construction and development loans 
interest reserves were a common industry practice when banks were more actively lending in their markets and the predictability of a sale or stabilization of the project had a high probability 
the interest reserve is a component of the loan proceeds which is determined at the loan s inception after a full evaluation of the sources and uses of funds for the project  and is intended to match the project s debt service requirements with its expected cash flows 
in all construction lending projects  we monitor the project to determine if it is being completed as planned and if sales stabilization projections are being met 
since the real estate market has diminished over time  the company has been less active in construction and development lending and the use of the interest reserves 
for present and future construction and development loan requests  borrowers must show sufficient cash reserves and significant excess cash flow from all sources in addition to other underwriting criteria measures 
the projects viability is a major consideration as well  along with the probability of its stabilization and or sale 
due to the general lack of opportunities currently in our markets combined with our low desire for this segment of the lending portfolio  interest reserves are not commonplace 
supervision and regulation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of their operations 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and borrowers and  to a lesser extent  stockholders 
changes in applicable laws  regulations  or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business 
the following summarizes certain of the more important aspects of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions 
supervisory authorities the company is a bank holding company  registered with and regulated by the federal reserve board frb 
all four of its subsidiary banks are kentucky state chartered banks 
two of the company s subsidiary banks are members of their regional federal reserve bank 
the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions kdfi 
the regulatory authorities routinely examine the company and its subsidiary banks to monitor their compliance with laws and regulations  financial condition  adequacy of capital and reserves  quality and documentation of loans  payment of dividends  adequacy of systems and controls  credit underwriting and asset liability management  and the establishment of branches 
the company and its subsidiary banks are required to file regular reports with the frb  the fdic and the kdfi  as applicable 
capital the frb  the fdic  and the kdfi require the company and its subsidiary banks to meet certain ratios of capital to assets in order to conduct their activities 
to be well capitalized  the institutions must generally maintain a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of or more 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity and related surplus  retained earnings  and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill net of certain deferred tax liabilities and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and a limited amount of other items 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are generally weighted for risk 
certain assets  such as cash and us government securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as commercial and consumer loans  have a risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  average assets as defined are used and are not risk weighted 
if the institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a series of restrictions that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company  if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result 
undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval  which must be guaranteed by the institution s parent holding company 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision issued final rules related to global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity commonly referred to as basel iii previously agreed on by the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee 
the new rules present details of the basel iii framework  which includes increased capital requirements and limits the types of instruments that can be included in tier capital 
basel iii includes the following provisions i that the minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets be increased to from the current level of  to be fully phased in by january   and ii that the minimum requirement for the tier risk based capital ratio will be increased from to  to be fully phased in by january  the new minimums will be phases in starting january  basel iii also includes a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to maintain an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets in addition to the minimum requirement 
this requirement will be phased in between january  and january  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and  while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress  if a bank s regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement  the bank will be subject to more stringent constraints on dividends and bonuses 
in addition  basel iii includes a countercyclical buffer of up to  which could be imposed by countries to address economies that appear to be building excessive system wide risks due to rapid growth 
to constrain the build up of excess leverage in the banking system  basel iii introduces a new non risk based leverage ratio 
a minimum tier leverage ratio of will be tested during a parallel run period between january  and january  based on the results of the parallel run period  any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of the impact from basel iii is not expected to have a material impact on the company s level of capital since current levels are in excess of the requirements 
basel iii includes two separate standards for supervising liquidity risks which include i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that banks have a sufficient amount of high quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress scenario over a day period  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon 
after an observation period beginning in  the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on january  the revised net stable funding ratio will become effective january  basel iii implementation in the us will require that regulations and guidelines be issued by us banking regulators  which may significantly differ from the recommendations published by the basel committee

deposit insurance each of the company s subsidiary banks are members of the fdic  and their deposits are insured by the fdic s deposit insurance fund dif up to the amount permitted by law 
the company s subsidiary banks are thus subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
in february  the fdic adopted a long term dif restoration plan as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increased base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from its then current 
to its statutorily mandated minimum of within eight years as amended 
beginning april  the fdic established a bank s initial base assessment rate ranging between and basis points  depending on the banks risk category 
the initial base assessment rate is then adjusted higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
adjustments to the initial base assessment rate are based on a bank s level of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate ranges between and basis points and is applied to a banks assessable deposits when computing the fdic insurance assessment amount 
the fdic adopted an emergency special assessment in which superseded its interim rule that would have imposed a basis point assessment with an option for an additional basis point assessment 
under the final rule adopted  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on a bank s total assets minus tier capital as of june  and collected september  the company paid million related to the special assessment 
the final rule also authorized the fdic to impose up to two additional basis points assessments if needed while capping each assessment at basis points of the banks assessment base 
in addition to the fdic s special assessment for  the fdic in november approved a final rule requiring banks to prepay their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of as well as all of   and on december  the prepayment was adopted by the fdic in lieu of an additional special assessment as summarized in the preceding paragraph 
the assessment rate used for all periods covered in the prepayment plan was the bank s assessment rate in effect as of september   increased by basis points for all of and the prepayment was based on a bank s regular assessment base total domestic deposits as of september   with a quarterly increase of an estimated annual growth rate through the end of the prepaid assessment is applied against actual future quarterly assessments until exhausted 
any funds remaining after june  will be returned to the institution 
requiring this prepaid assessment does not limit the fdic from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk based assessment system 
the company paid million on december  related to this assessment 
prepaid fdic insurance assessments are included in other assets on the company s balance sheet 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act requires changes to a number of components of the fdic insurance assessment with an implementation date of april  the dodd frank act requires the fdic to adopt a new dif restoration plan to ensure that the reserve ratio increases to from of insured deposits by under the new restoration plan  the fdic will forego the uniform three basis point increase in initial assessment rates scheduled to take place on january  the fdic has proposed new regulations that would redefine the assessment base as average consolidated assets less average tangible equity 
the proposed regulations would use the current assessment rate schedule with modifications to the unsecured debt and brokered deposit adjustments  and eliminate the secured liability adjustment 
at least semi annually  the fdic will update its loss and income projections for the dif and  if needed  increase or decrease assessment rates 
in establishing assessments  the fdic is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion 
in addition to deposit insurance assessments  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership government corporation established by the competitive equality banking act of possessing assessment powers in addition to the fdic 
the fdic acts as a collection agent for fico  whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct federal savings loan insurance corporation 
fico assessment rates are determined quarterly and will continue until the fico bonds mature in during the fourth quarter of  the fdic issued a final rule implementing provisions of the dodd frank act that provide for temporary unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts

apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies 
require the federal banking regulators to seek to make their capital requirements countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital 
provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance 
make permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
increase the authority of the federal reserve to examine non bank subsidiaries 
codify and expand the source of strength doctrine as a statutory requirement 
the source of strength doctrine represents the long held policy view by the federal reserve that a bank holding company should serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on commercial demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate

recent regulatory events and increased capital requirements the company s subsidiary banks are subject to capital based regulatory requirements 
the company has historically managed its banks capital levels with the goal of meeting the criteria established by its regulators for each bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized 
historically  to be well capitalized  a depository institution needed to have a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as of december   each of the company s four subsidiary banks satisfied these capital ratios 
although each of the company s subsidiary banks was well capitalized as of december   some of their capital levels have decreased in recent years as a result of the economic downturn that began in late because of the turmoil in the banking markets and continued difficulty many banks are experiencing with their loan portfolios  bank regulatory agencies are increasingly requiring banks to maintain higher capital reserves as a cushion for dealing with any further deterioration in their loan portfolios in order to maintain well capitalized status

under this authority  bank regulators can require the company to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 
primarily as a result of increased levels of nonperforming assets  the parent company  farmers bank  and citizens northern have entered into separate memoranda of understanding with our regulators and united bank has consented to a cease and desist order from its regulators 
in the aggregate  these memoranda of understanding and the cease and desist order  among other things  require the company to develop an acceptable capital plan to ensure that the consolidated organization remains well capitalized and each of its subsidiary banks meet the capital requirements imposed by their regulator as described elsewhere in this report  increase the regulatory capital ratios at these three banks  these three banks refrain from paying dividends to the parent company unless approved in advance by the regulators and the company not make future interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without seeking prior approval from frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
if the company is unable to comply with the terms of its current regulatory orders  or is unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory orders to which it may become subject  then we could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including cease and desist orders  prompt corrective actions and or other regulatory enforcement actions 
if the company s regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
if one or more of the company s banks were unable to comply with regulatory requirements  such banks could ultimately face failure 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
our nonperforming assets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and take significant management time to resolve 
as of december   nonperforming loans which include restructured loans of million totaled million or of the company s loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets which include foreclosed real estate were million or of total assets at year end in addition  loans past due days and still accruing were million as of december  nonperforming assets adversely affect the company s net income in various ways 
if economic conditions do not improve or actually worsen in our markets  the company could continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming assets 
the company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting interest income 
when the company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  it is required to mark the related loan to the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  which decreases earnings 
these loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital the company s regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks 
while the company seeks to reduce its problem loans through workouts  restructurings and otherwise  decreases in the value of these assets  the underlying collateral or our borrowers performance or financial conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management of our banks  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future 
losses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance established for that purpose  which will have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
volatility and deterioration in the broader economy increases the company s risk of credit losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
if a significant number of loans in the company s portfolio are not repaid  it would have an adverse effect on its earnings and overall financial condition 
like all banks  the company s subsidiaries maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management of each subsidiary s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in their loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
this evaluation is primarily based upon a review of the bank s and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  known risks contained in the bank s loan portfolio  composition and growth of the bank s loan portfolio and economic factors 
additionally  a bank s regulators may require additional provision for the loan portfolio in connection with regulatory examinations  agreements or orders 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
as a result  the company s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to cover actual losses in its loan portfolio 
consequently  the company risks having additional future provisions for loan losses that may continue to adversely affect its earnings 
if the company s local markets experience a prolonged recession or economic downturn  it may be required to make further increases in its allowance for loan losses and to charge off additional loans  which would adversely affect its results of operations and capital 
for the year  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million  which includes million for the fourth quarter  and recorded net loan charge offs of million  million of which was in the fourth quarter 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of million and net loan charge offs of million for  and a million provision and million of net loan charge offs which were recorded for the fourth quarter of substantially all of the company s loans are to businesses and individuals located in kentucky 
a continuing or prolonged decline in the economy of central and northern kentucky could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
generally  the company s nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers  however  more recently the deterioration in the general economy has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of delinquencies and nonperforming loans 
slower sales and excess inventory in the residential housing market has been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures for residential construction and land development loans 
as of december   the company s total nonperforming loans had increased to million or of loans compared to million or of loans at december  if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  the company expects that it will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  the company expects that a prolonged recession or economic downturn could severely impact economic conditions in its market areas and that it could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  the company may be required to make further increases in its provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
if such additional provisions and charge offs cause the company to experience losses  it may be required to contribute additional capital to its bank subsidiaries to maintain capital ratios required by regulators 
the company s exposure to credit risk is increased by its real estate development lending 
real estate development loans have dominated the company s increase in impaired loans 
substantially all of the company s million nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  are secured by real estate 
development lending has historically been considered to be higher credit risk than single family residential lending 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers 
such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy in general because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development and  in most cases  sale of their property 
these loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortized over the loan period  but have a balloon payment due at maturity of the loan 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property 
in the current economic environment  the ability of borrowers to refinance or sell newly developed property or vacant land has greatly diminished 
if the real estate markets were to worsen or not improve  the company would likely experience increased credit losses and require additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses  which would adversely impact the company s earnings and financial condition 
the company s investment securities portfolio is comparatively larger than other community banks and it is more dependent on its investment portfolio to generate net income 
unlike many other community banks  the company relies more heavily on its investment securities portfolio as a source of interest income because it has a comparatively small loan portfolio 
if the company is not able to successfully manage the interest rate spread on the investment portfolio  its net interest income will decrease  which would adversely affect its results of operations and could negatively impact net income 
investment securities tend to have a lower risk than loans  and as such  generally provide a lower yield 
for  average investment securities made up of the company s average total assets 
interest income on investment securities accounted for of total interest income for in the company sold and realized net gains on investment securities 
the company may not have the same level of net gains and may have net realized losses in future periods on the sale of investment securities  which would reduce earnings 
moreover  due to the current interest rate environment  proceeds from recent sales may be reinvested in investment securities with lower yields which may reduce earnings from investment securities 
the company continually monitors its investment securities portfolio for deteriorating values and for other than temporary impairments 
any material other than temporary impairments would likewise have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and could lead to additional losses 
the company cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economy on its future results of operations or the market price of its stock 
the national economy and the financial services sector in particular continue to face unique challenges 
the company cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted its performance and the markets it serves 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in the company s local markets would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects  and could also cause the market price of the company s stock to decline 
while it is impossible to predict how long these conditions may exist  the economic downturn could continue to present risks for some time for our industry and the company 
interest rate volatility could significantly harm the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  the policies of the company s regulators  and the prevailing interest rates in the united states and the company s markets 
in addition  it is increasingly common for the company s competitors  who may be aggressively seeking to attract deposits as a result of increased liquidity concerns arising from changing economic or other conditions  to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates 
a significant component of the company s earnings is the net interest income of its subsidiary banks  which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets  such as loans  and the expense of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
a change in market interest rates could adversely affect the company s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it collects on loans and investments  or  alternatively  if interest rates earned on earning assets decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities 
consequently  as with most financial institutions  the company is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
the fdic has increased deposit insurance premiums to restore and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund  which has increased costs to the company 
under the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by the dodd frank act  the fdic must establish and implement a plan to restore the deposit insurance fund s designated reserve ratio to of insured deposits by the dodd frank act removed the previously established upper limit reserve ratio of 
the fdic must continue to assess and consider the appropriate level of the reserve ratio annually by considering each of the following risk of loss to the insurance fund  economic conditions affecting the banking industry  the prevention of sharp swings in the assessment rates  and any other factors the fdic deems important 
in december the fdic announced that it had established the long term reserve ratio at 
the fdic previously implemented a restoration plan that changed both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
as part of this plan  during the second quarter of it increased deposit insurance assessment rates generally and imposed a special assessment of five basis points on each insured institution s total assets less tier capital 
the special assessment in  which was in addition to the regular quarterly risk based assessment  totaled approximately million for the company 
in the wake of a rapid depletion of the fdic s deposit insurance fund resulting from a high number of bank failures  the fdic required that all with limited exceptions insured institutions pay in the fourth quarter of its following estimated three years quarterly deposit assessments in advance 
this resulted in an aggregate payment by the company s bank subsidiaries totaling million in the fourth quarter of the three years advance payment was recorded as a prepaid asset that is being expensed in approximately equal amounts over prepayment period and  thus  only impact earnings in the normal course 
however  the advance payment reduced the liquid assets of the company s bank subsidiaries at the time of payment 
the company expects that assessment rates may continue to increase in the near term due to the significant cost of bank failures  the relatively large number of troubled banks that may fail in the future  and the requirement that the fdic increase the reserve ratio 
any increase in assessments could adversely impact the company s future earnings and liquidity 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits of business customers could increase the company s interest expense 
federal prohibitions against financial institutions paying interest on demand deposit accounts of business customers were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions can offer to pay interest on commercial demand deposits to compete for customers 
the company cannot predict the interest rates other institutions may offer 
the company s interest expense is expected to increase and its net interest margin is expected to decrease should it begin to pay interest on commercial demand deposits to attract additional customers or to keep current customers 
this could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
any future losses may require the company to raise additional capital  however  such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain levels of capital to support its operations 
furthermore  in the wake of recent regularly scheduled examinations of three of its subsidiaries  the company s regulators have required these three banks to raise their capital to levels significantly above the well capitalized benchmark 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time and on the company s future financial condition and performance 
accordingly  the company cannot make assurances with respect to its ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
the tightening of available liquidity could limit the company s ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand  which could adversely affect its earnings and capital levels 
a tightening of the credit and liquidity markets and the company s inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits may negatively affect its earnings and capital levels 
in addition to deposit growth  maturity of investment securities and loan payments from borrowers  the company relies from time to time on advances from the federal home loan bank and other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits 
in the event of a further downturn in the economy  these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to the company 
the company s liquidity position could be significantly constrained if it were unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank or other wholesale funding sources 
the company s financial condition and outlook may be adversely affected by damage to its reputation 
the company s financial condition and outlook is highly dependent upon perceptions of its business practices and reputation 
its ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged 
negative public opinion could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including regulatory actions taken against the company  lending practices  corporate governance  regulatory compliance  mergers of its subsidiaries  or sharing or inadequate protection of customer information 
damage to the company s reputation could give rise to loss of customers and legal risks  which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition 
the company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services 
the company conducts most of its operations in central and northern kentucky 
the banking and financial services businesses in these areas are highly competitive and increased competition in its primary market areas may adversely impact the level of its loans and deposits 
ultimately  the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  the company s competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
if the company is unable to attract and retain banking customers  it may be unable to continue its loan growth and level of deposits 
the company s financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
the financial accounting standards board and the sec frequently change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws  regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
the short term and long term impact of changes to banking capital standards could negatively impact the company s regulatory capital and liquidity 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision issued final rules related to global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity 
the new rules present details of the basel iii framework  which includes increased capital requirements and limits the types of instruments that can be included in tier capital 
basel iii includes the following provisions i that the minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets be increased to from the current level of  to be fully phased in by january   and ii that the minimum requirement for the tier risk based capital ratio will be increased from to  to be fully phased in by january  the new minimums will be phases in starting january  basel iii also includes a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to maintain an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets in addition to the minimum requirement 
this requirement will be phased in between january  and january  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and  while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress  if a bank s regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement  the bank will be subject to more stringent constraints on dividends and bonuses 
in addition  basel iii includes a countercyclical buffer of up to  which could be imposed by countries to address economies that appear to be building excessive system wide risks due to rapid growth 
to constrain the build up of excess leverage in the banking system  basel iii introduces a new non risk based leverage ratio 
a minimum tier leverage ratio of will be tested during a parallel run period between january  and january  based on the results of the parallel run period  any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of basel iii includes two separate standards for supervising liquidity risks which include i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that banks have a sufficient amount of high quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress scenario over a day period  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon 
after an observation period beginning in  the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on january  the revised net stable funding ratio will become effective january  basel iii implementation in the us will require that regulations and guidelines be issued by us banking regulators  which may significantly differ from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
the company cannot predict at this time the precise content of capital and liquidity guidelines or regulations that may be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over us and our subsidiaries  or the impact that any changes in regulation would have on the company 
however  we expect that the new standards will generally require the company or our banking subsidiaries to maintain more capital  with common equity as a more predominant component  or manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities in order to comply with new liquidity requirements  which could significantly impact our return on equity  financial condition  operations  capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities 
the price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult to resell it when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of its common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section general economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets  changes in global financial markets  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical events  conditions in our local and national credit  mortgage and housing markets  developments with respect to financial institutions generally  including government regulation  our dividend practice  and actual and anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and earnings 
the market value of the company s common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general  including price and trading fluctuations 
these conditions may result in volatility in the level of  and fluctuations in  the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  the company s common stock and sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the market  in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the company s common stock 
there may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the company s equity  which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
the market price of the company s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the company of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur 
the company s board of directors is authorized generally to cause it to issue additional common stock  as well as series of preferred stock  without any action on the part of the company s shareholders except as may be required under the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  the board has the power  without shareholder approval  to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights  preferences and other terms 
this could include preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation 
if the company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if the company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
you may not receive dividends on the company s common stock 
holders of the company s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if its board of directors declares them  and as permitted by its regulators 
although the company has up through historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock  it is not required to do so 
the company s board of directors reduced its quarterly common stock dividend in january from 
per share to 
per share and again in october to 
per share 
the company also agreed to not make interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without prior approval from frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
however  there can be no assurance the company s regulators will provide such approvals in the future 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
in addition  the company s payment of dividends is subject to certain restrictions as a result of its issuance of series a preferred stock to the treasury on january  under the tarp cpp 
the dividends declared on the company s series a preferred stock reduce the net income available to common stockholders and reduce earnings per common share 
moreover  under the terms of the company s articles of incorporation  it is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of its common stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series a preferred stock 
further  until january   the company must have the treasury s approval before it may increase dividends on its common stock above the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share we declared prior to october   which was 
per share 
this restriction no longer applies if all the series a preferred stock has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
if the company is in arrears on interest payments on its trust preferred securities  it may not pay dividends on its common stock until such interest obligations are brought current 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiary banks and certain regulatory considerations 
the parent company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary banks 
as a result  the company s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its bank subsidiaries 
there are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of three of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to the parent company and its ability to make payments to its shareholders  including certain regulatory approvals of dividends or distributions 
there can be no assurance that the company will receive such approval or that it will resume paying dividends to shareholders 
the trading volume in the company s common stock is less than that of many other similar companies 
the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select stock market 
as of december  the day average trading volume of the company s common stock on nasdaq was  shares or 
of the total common shares outstanding of  an efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of a stock at any given time 
the company has no control over such individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions 
given the lower trading volume of the company s common stock  larger sales volumes of its common stock could cause the value of its common stock to decrease 
moreover  due to its lower trading volume it may take longer to liquidate your position in the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance when the company s series a preferred stock and related warrant issued to the treasury can be redeemed 
subject to consultation with banking regulators  the company intends to repurchase the series a preferred stock  and potentially the warrant  it issued to the treasury when it believes the credit metrics in its loan portfolio have improved for the long term and the overall economy has rebounded 
however  there can be no assurance when the series a preferred stock and warrant held by the treasury can be repurchased  if at all 
until such time as the series a preferred stock are repurchased  the company will remain subject to the terms and conditions of those instruments  which  among other things  limit the company s ability to repurchase or redeem common stock or increase the dividends on its common stock over 
per share prior to further  the company s continued participation in the cpp subjects it to increased regulatory and legislative oversight  including with respect to executive compensation 
these new and any future oversight and legal requirements and implementing standards under the cpp may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry as a whole  and particularly on cpp participants such as the company 
holders of the company s series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of the company s common stockholders 
the series a preferred stock that the company issued to the treasury is senior to the company s shares of common stock  and holders of the series a preferred stock have certain rights and preferences that are senior to holders of the company s common stock 
the restrictions on the company s ability to declare and pay dividends to common stockholders are discussed above 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries may not purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the company s common stock unless the company has paid in full all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock for all prior dividend periods  other than in certain circumstances 
furthermore  the series a preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference over shares of the company s common stock in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
holders of the company s series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
except in connection with the election of two directors to the company s board of directors if its dividends on the series a preferred stock are in arrears and we have missed six quarterly dividends and as otherwise required by law  holders of the company s series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the company s articles of incorporation  the vote or consent of holders owning at least of the shares of series a preferred stock outstanding is required for any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the series a preferred stock  any amendment to the rights of the series a preferred stock that adversely affects the rights  preferences  privileges or voting power of the series a preferred stock  or consummation of any merger  share exchange or similar transaction unless the shares of series a preferred stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity other than the company and have such rights  preferences  privileges and voting power as are not materially less favorable than those of the holders of the series a preferred stock 
the company s common stock constitutes equity and is subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness and its series a preferred stock  and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non common equity claims against its subsidiaries 
shares of the company s common stock represent equity interests in our holding company and do not constitute indebtedness 
accordingly  the shares of the company s common stock rank junior to all of its indebtedness and to other non equity claims on farmers capital bank corporation with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims 
additionally  dividends to holders of the company s common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the company s series a preferred stock and any additional preferred stock we may issue 
the series a preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
the company s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or otherwise  and thus the ability of the company s common stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution  will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
as a result  holders of the company s common stock will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries  including claims of depositors 
as of december  our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately billion 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock after an initial five year period  the cost of this capital will increase substantially 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase from approximately million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value to million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value 
this increase in the annual dividend rate on the series a preferred stock would have a material negative effect on the earnings the company can retain for growth and to pay dividends on its common stock 
the current economic environment exposes the company to higher credit losses and expenses and may result in lower earnings or increase the likelihood of losses 
although the company remains well capitalized  it continues to operate in a very challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions  including the company  are being adversely effected by difficult economic conditions that have impacted not only local markets  but on a national and global scale 
substantial deterioration in real estate and other financial markets have and may continue to adversely impact the company s financial performance 
continuing declines in real estate values and home sales volumes  along with job losses and other economic stresses can decrease the value of collateral securing loans extended to borrowers  particularly that of real estate loans 
lower values of real estate securing loans may make it more difficult for the company to recover amounts it is owed in the event of default by a borrower 
the current economic conditions may result in a higher degree of financial stress on the company s borrowers and their customers which could impair the company s ability to collect payments on loans  potentially increasing loan delinquencies  nonperforming assets  foreclosures  and higher losses 
current market forces have and may in the future cause the value of investment securities or other assets held by the company to deteriorate  resulting in impairment charges  higher losses  and lower regulatory capital levels 
market volatility could adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity position  and access to additional capital 
the capital and credit markets experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during the recent economic downturn  with unprecedented levels of volatility and disruptions that took place beginning with the last few months of in many cases  this has led to downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital 
risks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of limited market area 
commercial banks and other financial institutions  including the company  are affected by economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  value of the dollar  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect profitability 
in addition  almost all of the company s primary business area is located in central and northern kentucky 
a significant downturn in this regional economy may result in  among other things  deterioration in the company s credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and may harm the financial stability of the company s customers 
due to the company s regional market area  these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on the company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger  more diverse market area 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans 
lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by unanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral 
due to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans  such loans present a greater risk to the company than other types of loans when non payment by a borrower occurs 
in addition  consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans  but generally carry higher risks of frequency of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
inability to hire or retain certain key professionals  management and staff could adversely affect the company s revenues and net income 
the company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business  including major revenue generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios 
the loss of key staff may adversely affect the company s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively  which could negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses  which could cause a decrease in our net income 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
the company s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the recently enacted dodd frank act may increase the company s costs of operations which could adversely impact the company results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law by president obama 
the goals of the new legislation include restoring public confidence in the financial system that resulted from the recent financial and credit crises  preventing another financial crisis  and allowing regulators to identify failings in the system before another crisis can occur 
as part of the reform  the dodd frank act creates the financial stability oversight council  with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk  and the bureau of consumer financial protection  which will have broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services 
the dodd frank act also changes the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators  imposes additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements in areas such as executive compensation and proxy access  and limits or prohibits proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks 
the scope of the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry  and requires the development and adoption of many implementing regulations over the next several months and years  consequently  the effects of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry and the company will depend  in large part  upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them and the approaches taken to implement the regulations 
the company has begun to assess the potential impact of the dodd frank act on its business and operations and believes that compliance with these new laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs  but at this early stage  the probable impact cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty 
compliance with the new laws and regulations could adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  any of which may impact the market price of the company s common stock 
the company believes that the dodd frank act will most likely impact it in the areas of corporate governance  deposit insurance assessments  capital requirements  and restrictions on fees charges to consumers

the company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors  new information  future events  or other changes 
discontinued operations in june  the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell kentucky banking centers  inc  its former wholly owned subsidiary based in glasgow  kentucky 
in addition  farmers georgetown entered into a definitive agreement during august to sell its owingsville and sharpsburg branches in bath county the branches 
these sales were completed during the fourth quarter of application of critical accounting policies the company s audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility from period to period 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements  and accounting for goodwill to be the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets 
additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions asset quality and nonperforming assets in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements  either directly or indirectly 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in certain cases  an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis  such as investment securities classified as available for sale 
in other cases  management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write down or whether a valuation reserve should be established 
the company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods 
where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices  quoted market prices are used for fair value 
the company characterizes active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information  with reasonably narrow bid ask spreads  and where received quoted prices do not vary widely 
when the financial instruments are not actively traded  other observable market inputs  such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics  may be used  if available  to determine fair value 
inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes  price quotations that vary substantially among market participants  or in which minimal information is released publicly 
when observable market prices do not exist  the company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods 
the valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns 
other factors such as model assumptions  market dislocations  and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value 
changes in these underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded 
additional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements  as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the company available for sale investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis 
available for sale investment securities are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include  but not limited to  the following inputs us treasury securities are priced using dealer quotes from active market makers and real time trading systems 
marketable equity securities are priced utilizing real time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities 
government sponsored agency debt securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields  matrix pricing  prepayment speeds  cash flows  live trading data  and market spreads sourced from new issues  dealer quotes  and trade prices  among others sources 
at december   all of the company s available for sale investment securities were measured using observable market data 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo includes properties acquired by the company through actual loan foreclosures and is carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value of oreo is based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data comprised of significant unobservable inputs 
if the carrying amount of the oreo exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell  an impairment loss is recorded through expense 
at december  oreo was million compared to million at year end impaired loans loans are considered impaired when full payment under the contractual terms is not expected 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance  the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
appraisals used in connection with valuing collateral dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach 
appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available 
such adjustments are usually significant and typically include significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value 
impaired loans were million and million at year end and  respectively 
accounting for goodwill during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that its previously recorded goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million 
see note goodwill and intangible assets of the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information

the primary goals of the company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value  increase and maintain a strong capital position  provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure  and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees 
the company generates a significant amount of its revenue  cash flows  and net income from interest income and net interest income  respectively 
interest income is generated by earnings on the company s earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest expense paid on amounts borrowed to support those earning assets 
interest expense is paid primarily on deposit accounts and other short and long term borrowing arrangements 
the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the company 
managing credit risk  or the risk of loss due to customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms  is also a factor that can significantly influence the operating results of the company 
the severe downturn in financial markets and in the overall economy during and into created unprecedented market volatility 
during that time  certain capital markets ceased to function and credit markets were unavailable to many businesses and consumers 
in response  the us government took extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets by enacting broad legislation and regulatory initiatives that included the largest stimulus plan in its history 
improvement in the us financial markets and the overall economy occurred during however  certain key metrics  such as high unemployment and lower real estate values persist 
this has had a significant negative effect on the company s operations in the form of elevated nonperforming loans  allowance for loan losses  and net loan charge offs 
following is a summary of the more significant issues that impacted the company during and that will continue to have an impact beyond the level of nonperforming assets is currently the most important issue facing the company 
nonperforming assets remain elevated due to a high number of borrowers that are unable to repay their loans  which has been heavily impacted by ongoing economic challenges that the company s borrowers and their customers face 
this has resulted in lower levels of interest income  elevated levels of the provision for loans losses  and impairment charges related to properties that the company has repossessed in an attempt to satisfy customer loan obligations 
nonperforming loans and assets  although higher at year end compared to year end  have decreased when compared to the recent high that occurred in the first quarter of with the naming of lloyd c 
hillard  jr 
as its president and chief executive officer in the first quarter of  the company has refocused its effort to establishing a culture of excellence within the organization 
initial efforts have been focused on improving the customer experience and building a strong credit culture 
these initiatives have included expanded employee training and reinforcement  strengthening loan policies  and improving underwriting standards 
the parent company and its subsidiary banks that have entered into agreements with banking regulators have exceeded the capital levels required under those agreements 
although the parent company continues to explore potential capital raising scenarios  there is currently no directive by regulators to raise any additional capital and no determination has been made as to if or when a capital raise will be completed 
net proceeds from a possible sale of securities could be used for any corporate purpose determined by the company s board of directors 
results of operations the company reported net income of million or 
per common share in compared to a net loss of million or per common share for this represents an improvement of million or per common share 
the prior year net loss was mainly attributed to a one time million after tax non cash goodwill charge representing the company s write off of its entire previously reported goodwill 
other significant factors impacting net income in the annual comparison include the following net interest income increased thousand or in the year to year comparison 
interest income decreased million or  but was offset by lower interest expense of million or 
the decrease in interest income was the result of lower rates and lower volume in both the loan and investment securities portfolios 
the decrease in interest expense was led by a reduction in interest on deposit accounts  primarily time deposits which  decreased million mainly due to a lower average rate paid 
the provision for loan losses decreased million or in compared to the prior year 
the provision for loan losses decreased mainly because there are fewer new nonperforming and impaired loans requiring specific allocations in the current period compared to the same quarter a year ago 
a decrease in loan volume contributed to a lesser extent 
the company experienced a lower rate of increase in nonperforming loans during compared to net nonperforming loans increased million or in during  nonperforming loans increased million or  million of which occurred during the fourth quarter 
net interest margin was for  an increase of basis points from for net interest spread was  up basis points compared to 
noninterest income in increased million or due primarily to a million increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities 
significant other favorable increases included net gains on the sale of loans of thousand or  allotment processing fees of thousand or  and non deposit service charges  commissions  and fees of thousand or 
decreases in noninterest income line items include service charges and fees on deposits of thousand or and trust income of thousand or total noninterest expenses decreased million in the annual comparison 
the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of was the main driver of the improvement 
all other expenses  on a net basis  were unchanged 
improvements continue to be made in a significant number of noninterest expense categories 
some of the larger decreases in noninterest expense categories include salaries and employee benefits of million or  amortization of intangible assets of thousand or  equipment expense of thousand or  and correspondent banking fees of thousand or 
net expenses related to repossessed assets increased million or 
deposit insurance expense and bank franchise taxes were up thousand or and thousand or  respectively 
income tax expense was million for with an effective income tax rate of 
for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million that was driven by the impact of the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter 
a portion of the company s previously recorded goodwill was created in taxable business combinations and therefore was able to record a tax benefit of million attributed to the impairment charge 
return on assets roa was 
in  an increase of basis points from for the increase in roa is due mainly to the goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in  which negatively impacted roa in the prior year by basis points 
an increase in net interest margin and a lower provision for loan losses make up for basis points and basis points  respectively  of the increase in roa 
higher noninterest income  mainly from investment securities gains  increased roa by basis points offset by a basis point decrease attributed to income taxes 
return on equity roe for was compared to for interest income interest income results from interest earned on earning assets  which primarily includes loans and investment securities 
interest income is affected by volume average balance  composition of earning assets  and the related rates earned on those assets 
total interest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for interest income decreased across all major earning asset categories and was driven primarily by lower interest rates and  in the case for loans  a lower average volume 
rate declines were driven mainly by a combination of continuing weak economic conditions in the company s markets as well as the company s overall strategy of being more selective in pricing deposits and extending loans 
actions taken by the federal reserve board has also kept the level of interest rates at near historic lows throughout in general  the company s variable and floating rate assets and liabilities that have reset since the prior year  as well as activity related to new earning assets and funding sources  have repriced downward to reflect the overall lower interest rate environment 
the company s tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for interest expense interest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities  which are made up of interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other short and long term borrowed funds 
interest expense is affected by volume  composition of interest bearing liabilities  and the related rates paid on those liabilities 
total interest expense was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for interest expense decreased mainly as a result of a lower average rate paid on deposits in an overall lower interest rate environment 
volume reductions  primarily on time deposits  also contributed to lower interest expense as the company has made decisions to strategically reduce certain higher rate deposits 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for the decrease in interest expense for exceeded the decrease for interest income as the company has been able to more aggressively reduce its funding costs  particularly related to interest on deposits 
the federal funds rate  which was at at the beginning of  fell to near zero percent by the end of and has remained at that level for all of and new deposits and other borrowing arrangements as well as the repricing of existing deposits and borrowings at lower market interest rates  particularly for shorter term instruments  contributed to the overall lower interest expense in the comparable periods 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets 
the two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread represents the difference between the taxable equivalent yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  which are also available to fund earning assets 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets  their related yields  and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and the average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin 
the table following this discussion represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
net interest income was million for  an increase of thousand or compared to million for interest income for decreased million  but was offset by a million or decrease in total interest expense 
the company reported a de crease in all major interest income and interest expense line items that was mainly attributed to lower interest rates 
generally  variable and floating rate assets and liabilities that have reset since the prior reporting period as well as activity related to new earning assets and funding sources  have repriced downward to reflect an overall lower interest rate environment 
rate declines for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were driven mainly by continuing weak economic conditions in the company s markets as well as the company s overall strategy of being more selective in pricing deposits and extending loans in an effort to improve net interest margin  overall profitability  and capital position 
in addition to the impact of lower overall interest rates  a decrease in volume also contributed to lower interest income on loans and interest expense on time deposits and long term borrowings 
volume decreases for loans and deposits have been largely strategy driven  whereby the company has been more selective in pricing deposits and extending loans in a more focused effort to improve net interest margin and overall profitability 
the decrease in the volume of long term borrowings were impacted by the maturity during the fourth quarter of of million of borrowed funds associated with the company s balance sheet leverage transaction 
tax equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of thousand or compared to million for the net interest margin was  an increase of basis points from in the prior year 
net interest spread accounted for basis points of the higher net interest margin and was for compared to for the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funds negatively impacted net interest margin by basis points in the comparison 
the effect of noninterest bearing sources of funds on net interest margin typically decreases as the average cost of funds declines 
the company continues to actively monitor and proactively manage the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment 
this task has become increasingly more difficult following the extreme market disruptions and economic downturn that began in competition in the company s market areas continues to be intense 
the overall interest rate environment remains low by historical measures 
the federal reserve has kept its short term federal funds target rate at near zero percent since mid december and has indicated that it expects to maintain that rate at an exceptionally low level for an extended period of time 
yields on treasury securities of medium and longer term maturity structures have decreased as of year end compared to a year earlier 
the two and year notes decreased basis points and basis points  respectively in the comparison while the year bond dropped basis points 
similar to the short term federal funds target rate  the prime interest rate has not changed since december the company uses the prime interest rate as part of its pricing model primarily on variable rate commercial real estate loans 
the prime interest rate can have a significant impact on the company s interest income on loans that reprice based on changes to the prime interest rate 
the company s variable interest rate loans contain provisions that limit the amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate during the life of the loan 
this will limit the increase or decrease in interest income on loans that have interest rates tied to the prime interest rate 
for  the average yield earned on loans was  which is in excess of the prime interest rate of at year end predicting the movement of future interest rates is uncertain 
during  the average rates for two of the most significant components of net interest income for the company  loans and time deposits  both declined 
as previously noted  the average rate earned on the company s loan portfolio declined basis points to for the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in the annual comparison 
should interest rates on the company s earning assets and interest paying liabilities reprice lower  the company s yield on earning assets could potentially decrease faster than its cost of funds 
should interest rates reprice higher  the company s cost of funds may also increase and could continue to increase faster than the yields on earning assets  resulting in a lower net interest margin

income stated at fully tax equivalent basis using the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
noninterest income noninterest income for was million  an increase of million or compared to million for the increase in noninterest income was due primarily to a million increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities 
significant other favorable increases included net gains on the sale of loans of thousand or  allotment processing fees of thousand or  non deposit service charges  commissions  and fees of thousand or  and other income of thousand or 
decreases in noninterest income line items include service charges and fees on deposits of thousand or and trust income of thousand or 
the sale of investment securities in were strategically made to lock in some of the increase in their values and to bolster capital and to help counterbalance the high level of provision for loan losses and expenses related to repossessed real estate 
the sales were made after careful analysis of multiple reinvestment scenarios that would minimize the negative impact on the net interest margin on a go forward basis 
the thousand increase in net gains on the sale of loans is volume related  as the amount of loans sold in were million  up million or compared to the increase in loans sold is due to a higher volume of secondary market origination activity 
loan originations and refinance activities  buoyed by the low interest rate environment  picked up during the latter half of particularly in the months of october and november 
the thousand increase in allotment processing fees is due to overall higher transaction volumes 
the increase in other non deposit service charges  commissions  and fees of thousand was driven by higher interchange fees of thousand or mainly resulting from higher transaction volumes 
the thousand increase in other income is mainly due to a thousand lower aggregate loss attributed to tax credit partnerships 
the loss attributed to these partnerships in was thousand compared to a loss of thousand for the aggregate carrying amount of the company s investment in the partnerships at year end was thousand 
the thousand decrease in service charges and fees on deposits is mainly attributed to lower overdraft insufficient funds charges of thousand or 
the decrease in fees is attributed to volume declines  which led to lower fees of thousand or and thousand or during the fourth quarter of compared to the linked third quarter and fourth quarter a year ago  respectively 
beginning in the third quarter of  the federal reserve board began to prohibit financial institutions from charging fees to customers for paying overdrafts on one time debit card and automated teller machine transactions without the customer opting in to the overdraft service for those transactions 
the rule change  combined with the company s earlier adoption during of certain regulatory best practices related to overdraft charges  have contributed to the decrease in revenue from overdraft insufficient funds 
however  the company is unable to precisely quantify the impact related to these events 
the company is also unable to predict how this rule will impact the level of overdraft insufficient funds fees it will collect in future periods 
the thousand decrease in trust income is due to lower overall asset values on which trust fees are based combined with the collection of a large fee in the second quarter of the prior year 
noninterest expense total noninterest expenses were million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the decrease in noninterest expense in the comparison periods is mainly attributed to a million one time  non cash goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of all other expenses  on a net basis  were unchanged for compared to improvements continue to be made in a significant number of noninterest expense categories 
the more significant decreases in noninterest expense categories in the comparison include salaries and employee benefits of million or  amortization of intangible assets of thousand or  equipment expense of thousand or  and correspondent banking fees of thousand or 
net expenses related to repossessed assets increased million or 
deposit insurance expense and bank franchise taxes were up thousand or and thousand or  respectively 
the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in was a result of the company s annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter 
during that testing  the company concluded that as a result of continuing economic weaknesses and heightened market concern surrounding the credit risk and market capital position of the overall financial institutions industry  the fair value of the company s single reporting unit would more likely than not be below its carrying amount 
the company engaged an independent third party to assist with its goodwill impairment analysis and determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill was significantly less than the carrying value  resulting in the non cash impairment charge 
the million decrease in salaries and employee benefits is due to an overall shrinking workforce and a decrease in the company s matching contributions to its salary savings plan that took effect in the first quarter of the average number of full time equivalent employees was for  down or from for in addition  starting in the first quarter of the company began to match of eligible employee deferrals up to a maximum of of the participants compensation related to its salary saving plan 
for  the company matched all eligible employee contributions up to of the participants compensation 
amortization of intangible assets  which relate to customer lists and core deposits from prior acquisitions  is decreasing as a result of amortization schedules that allocate a higher amount of amortization in the earlier periods following an acquisition consistent with how the assets are used 
the thousand decrease in equipment expenses for is mainly due to lower depreciation expense of thousand 
the decrease in depreciation expense is a result of a relatively small amount of net additions to the company s fixed assets 
a decrease in depreciation expense on existing fixed assets exceeded the amount of depreciation expense related to net new fixed assets in the comparison 
the sharp decrease in correspondent bank fees of thousand are mainly a function of lower volume related to a custodial services contract with the kentucky teachers retirement system that expired at the end of the second quarter of that was not renewed 
the million increase in net other real estate expenses is attributed to the elevated amount of foreclosed real estate properties held by the company during expenses relating to these properties generally include amounts to prepare the properties for resale and  in some cases  impairment charges to write down a property s book value to its fair value less estimated costs to sell as determined by appraisal 
impairment charges included in net other real estate expenses were million for three separate real estate developments account for million of the total impairment charges 
the increase in deposit insurance expense of thousand was driven mainly by higher assessment rates primarily at two of the company s bank subsidiaries that are subject to regulatory agreements 
deposit assessment rates fluctuate as a result of changes to a bank s federal deposit insurance corporation s fdic risk category that takes into account its capital levels  supervisory ratings  and other risk measures based on various financial ratios established by the fdic 
the thousand increase in bank franchise taxes correlates to an increase in the base amount subject to the kentucky bank franchise tax of the company s bank subsidiaries 
the tax base is made up of a banks net capital  as defined  which generally represents the total capital of a bank adjusted for us and kentucky obligations as defined by kentucky banking regulations 
income tax income tax expense was million for with an effective income tax rate of 
for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million that was driven by the impact of the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter 
a portion of the company s previously recorded goodwill was created in taxable business combinations and therefore was able to record a tax benefit of million attributed to the impairment charge 
financial condition the size of the company s balance sheet decreased at year end compared to year end the reduction is due primarily to the company s broad strategy to realign its balance sheet 
the most significant parts of the strategy has included a more cautious and measured approach to lending as well as a more focused effort in reducing the company s overall cost of funds 
for loans  the approach has been to be more selective  in terms of acceptable credit risk  in the credits that are underwritten 
on the funding side  the approach has been to more aggressively reprice higher rate time deposits downward as they mature or by electing to not renew 
the strategy of reducing the overall size of the balance sheet is part of the company s plan to improve its net interest margin  nonperforming asset levels  capital ratios  and overall profitability 
total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million or from the year end the decrease in assets occurred across all major asset groups and mainly is reflective of the balance sheet realignment strategy summarized above 
the most significant decreases were as follows cash and cash equivalents million or  investment securities million or  loans net of unearned income and allowance for loan losses million or  and company owned life insurance million or 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities is attributed primarily to the overall net funding position of the company  which was heavily influenced by the plan to lower funding costs and improve net interest margin 
the decrease in investment securities has also been impacted by the overall low interest rate environment such that the company has reinvested more of the amounts it received from maturing or called bonds into shorter term cash equivalents 
the decrease in company owned life insurance is attributed to the liquidation of million at the parent company of life insurance at its cash surrender value 
the parent company took this action during the first quarter of mainly to have additional cash available to inject into certain of its bank subsidiaries to strengthen their capital positions 
an additional million of company owned life insurance remains at the parent company at year end that is expected to be liquidated in the near term 
total liabilities were billion at december   a decrease of million or compared to december  net deposits decreased million or while net borrowed funds decreased million or 
the net decrease in deposits was led by lower interest bearing deposits of million or 
as discussed above  the decrease in interest bearing deposit balances is mainly attributed to the company s overall balance sheet realignment strategy and goal for reducing overall funding costs 
for  the company s average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was  a decrease of basis points compared to for the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was for or basis points lower than the previous year amount of 
lowering the cost of funds has led to a reduction of higher balance time deposits and many of these depositors that are seeking higher yields have withdrawn their balances at maturity in lieu of renewing at lower rates 
the decrease in net borrowed funds is due to a million or lower amount of long term borrowings outstanding in the year to year comparison 
long term borrowings decreased million as a result of scheduled maturities attributed to the company s balance sheet leverage transaction 
the remaining decrease is nearly all attributed to scheduled repayments of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
shareholders equity increased million or to million at year end compared to million a year earlier 
the increase in shareholders equity is due mainly to net income of million for the year partially offset by dividends on preferred stock of million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
management of the company considers it noteworthy to understand the relationship between farmers bank and the commonwealth of kentucky 
farmers bank provides various services to state agencies of the commonwealth 
as the depository for the commonwealth  checks are drawn on farmers bank by these agencies  which include paychecks and state income tax refunds 
farmers bank also processes vouchers of the wic women  infants and children program for the cabinet for human resources 
therefore  reviewing average balances is important to understanding the financial condition of the company as daily deposit balances can fluctuate significantly as a result of farmers bank s relationship with the commonwealth 
the commonwealth seeks qualified financial institutions to meet its banking needs by periodically issuing a request for proposal through a competitive bidding process 
in a change from past practices  farmers bank partnered with a larger out of state financial institution to better respond to the commonwealth s most recent request for proposal for banking services 
while the company and the commonwealth have had a mutually beneficial relationship in the past  the partnering concept brings greater resources to the business relationship 
the company can provide the commonwealth with an increased level of service by partnering with the larger financial institution  leveraging off of the company s extensive specialized knowledge base  and maintaining local synergies 
the bidding process  however  is highly competitive and there can be no assurance about whether farmers bank  through its partner  will continue to provide banking services to the commonwealth in the future 
the impact of not retaining the general depository services contract of the commonwealth would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  overall liquidity  or net cash flows 
on an average basis  total assets were billion for  a decrease of million or from the average for average total assets decreased million from year end as a result of the goodwill impairment charge at year end where the company wrote off the entire amount of its goodwill 
average earning assets decreased million or from year end however  as a percentage of total average assets  average earning assets were for  an increase of basis points from for average net loans decreased million or in the comparison 
deposits averaged billion for  a decrease of million or from average noninterest bearing deposit balances declined million or in the comparison led by a sharp decrease in amounts related to the commonwealth of million 
all other average noninterest bearing deposits increased million or 
average interest bearing deposits decreased million or led by lower time deposits of million or 
loans loans  net of unearned income  were billion at december   a decrease of million or compared to year end the company continues to take a measured and cautious approach to loan originations while executing its balance sheet realignment strategy and working through high levels of nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets increased sharply in the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of as a result of the lingering effects of one of the most severe recessions in recent history 
loans secured by farmland and real estate of other commercial enterprises increased million or at year end compared to year end all other sectors of the loan portfolio experienced declines 
commercial  financial  and agricultural based lending decreased million or 
real estate construction and land development lending was down million or and loans secured by residential real estate decreased million or 
in the annual comparison 
consumer installment loans and commercial leasing decreased million or and million or  respectively in the yearly comparison 
the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  is summarized in the table below 
adjustments have been made among categories of prior years to reclassify certain loans to conform to their current classification 
total loans in prior years did not change 
december  in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction and land development real estate mortgage residential real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises installment lease financing total when loan balances decline either as a result of lower demand or due to reasons such as for the company s plan to strategically shrink its balance sheet  the available funds are generally redirected to temporary investments or investment securities  which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and produce lower yields 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
subprime mortgage lending is defined by the company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay 
on average  loans represented of earning assets for  a decrease of basis points compared to for average loans represent a lower percentage of earning assets due to a lower average outstanding balance that has driven the overall reduction in average total earning assets

interest sensitivity fixed variable in thousands rate rate due after one but within five years due after five years total asset quality the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio  limiting exposure to any single customer or industry  rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria  and collateral requirements 
the company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner 
this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable incurred loan losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using a risk rated methodology 
many factors are considered when estimating the allowance 
these include  but are not limited to  past loan loss experience  an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the risk rated methodology includes segregating watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating specific reserves to these loans depending on their status 
for example  watch list loans  which may be identified by the internal loan review risk rating process or by regulatory examiner classification  are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due days or more are assigned a different loss percentage 
each of these percentages considers past experience as well as current factors 
the remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into three components having similar risk characteristics as follows commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate loans 
each of these components is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective rolling twelve quarter historical loss percentage 
additional allocations to the allowance may then be made for subjective factors  such as those mentioned above  as determined by senior managers who are knowledgeable about these matters 
during  the company further identified signs of deterioration in certain real estate development loans that have remained present into and specific allowances related to these loans were recorded 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on the information currently available  additional adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in the factors noted above 
borrowers may experience difficulty in periods of economic deterioration  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require additional increases in the provision for loan losses 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews could result in additional adjustments to the provision for loan losses based upon their judgments about relevant information available during their examination 
in general  allowance for loan losses increases as the level of nonperforming and impaired loans  as a percentage of net loans outstanding  increases 
the company s allowance for loan loss amount has heavily considered past loan loss experience to estimate current loan losses  but it also considers current trends within the portfolio that may not be indicative of past charge off levels 
adjustments are made to the allowance for loan losses as needed when such matters are identified 
although there were signs of improvements during  economic weaknesses remain as a result of one of the most severe economic declines in recent history which began in the latter part of and early these economic conditions resulted in significant stress through deterioration in credit quality and collateral values  primarily in the company s residential real estate development and commercial real estate sectors of its lending portfolio 
lower real estate values  increased foreclosures  and high levels of unemployment over a prolonged period have all contributed to the company s elevated amounts of nonperforming assets and loan charge offs 
these factors have also resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses primarily related to real estate development and commercial real estate lending 
real estate markets  both residential and commercial  remain strained and unemployment rates are forecasted to remain high for the foreseeable future 
a slowdown in real estate sales activity creates cash flow difficulties for those borrowers in real estate development and related businesses that primarily depend on the sale of real estate 
the company expects the lingering effects of the economic downturn to continue to hinder its efforts to improve asset quality in the short term 
the company works with its loan customers on an individual case by case basis in order to maximize loan repayments and does not have a formal loan modification program 
impaired loans are defined as loans in which the company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
collateral values are updated in accordance with policy guidelines by obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area 
following is a tabular presentation of impaired loans at december  that includes the loan type  unpaid principal balance  estimated collateral value  and type of collateral for significant groupings of loans in thousands loan type unpaid principal estimated collateral value collateral type real estate construction and land development primarily residential real estate developments real estate mortgage residential residential real estate  including single and multi family use real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises commercial real estate  including farmland and other business enterprises other business assets  inventory  accounts receivable  personal autos  and other vehicles total in the aggregate  the estimated collateral value for impaired loans exceeds the unpaid principal amount 
in many cases the estimated fair value of the collateral less cost to sell exceeds the loan balance and no impairment reserve is needed 
however  the company has taken a charge to write down certain of these impaired loans to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell 
at year end  the company had million in specific reserves related to its impaired loans 
of this total  million or is attributed to real estate construction and land development lending and million or is attributed to loans secured by residential real estate 
two individual credit relationships account for million or of the million specific reserves 
both of these credits have been restructured and have an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses for is mainly due to fewer new nonperforming and impaired loans requiring specific allocations compared to a year earlier 
an overall net decrease in loans outstanding contributed  to a lesser extent  to the lower provision for loan losses 
the company experienced a lower rate of increase in nonperforming loans during compared to nonperforming loans were million at year end  representing an increase of million over the prior year 
for  the increase in nonperforming loans was million  million of which occurred during the fourth quarter 
for additional information about nonperforming loans  refer to the caption nonperforming assets that follows 
net loan charge offs were million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for charge offs of million or of total charge offs for are attributed to four individual credit relationships that represent primarily residential real estate development projects 
gross charge offs and recoveries by loan category are detailed in the table that follows 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 
for  a decrease of basis points compared to for although the provision for loan losses was lower in compared to the year before  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans net of unearned income has increased to at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was and at year end and  respectively 
the relatively low percentage of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is due in part to the composition of nonperforming loans 
restructured loans account for of the total amount of nonperforming loans at year end the allowance attributed to credits that are restructured with lower interest rates represents the difference in the present value of future cash flows calculated at the loan s original effective interest rate and the new lower rate 
this generally results in a reserve for loan losses that is less severe than for other loans that are collateral dependent 
in addition to higher restructured loans  nonaccrual loans at year end include an aggregate amount of million higher balance loans representing five credit relationships that had specific reserves of million prior to being classified as nonaccrual 
the classification of these loans to nonaccrual status had a more limited impact on the allowance for loan losses since a reserve had already been established 
each of these loans were performing at year end  but were identified as impaired on that date and specific reserves were recorded 
from this group of credits  loans totaling million are secured primarily by real estate construction and land development projects and million secured mainly by residential real estate properties

nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
in general  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed for days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans occur when a lender  because of economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulty  grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
restructured loans typically include a reduction of the stated interest rate or an extension of the maturity date  among other possible concessions 
for the company  all of its restructured loans were granted rate concessions at the time of restructuring 
nonperforming assets were million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at year end nonperforming assets spiked upward by million or in the prior year and have remained elevated mainly as a result of the ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continues to strain the company and many of its customers  particularly those associated with real estate development lending 
the increase in nonperforming assets for compared to is primarily attributed to higher restructured loans of million or 
nonperforming assets by category are presented in the table below for the dates indicated

such loans were million at december   a decrease of million or compared to million at year end three of the company s four subsidiary banks experienced an overall net decrease in nonaccrual loans of million or in the annual comparison 
this was partially offset by a million or increase at one of the company s subsidiary banks due mainly to the addition of three credit relationships amounting to million 
of these three credits  two in the amount of million in the aggregate were identified as impaired during and specific reserves were allocated 
a third credit in the amount of million  with a specific reserve allocation of thousand  was added during the fourth quarter of the million net increase in restructured loans at year end compared to year end was led by a residential real estate development credit in the amount of million and three other separate credits totaling million 
of the three credits totaling million  one relates to a credit relationship with an outstanding total of million secured by vacation condo units and the other two represent million in the aggregate secured by commercial real estate properties 
the company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses 
cash flow projections are carefully scrutinized prior to restructuring any credits  past due credits are typically not granted concessions 
from time to time the company s affiliate banks modify a customer s loan  but such modifications may not meet the criteria for classification of restructured troubled debt 
the primary reasons for such restructurings are repricing a loan to a current market rate of interest to a borrower with good credit and adequate collateral value in order to retain the customer  changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly  semi annually  or annually where the loan is performing  the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value and the company believes valid reasons exist for the change  or extending the interest only payment period of a performing loan where the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value in instances where a project may still be in a phase of development or leasing up  but where the company believes completion will occur in the near future  or such extension is otherwise in the company s best interest 
as a modification is made  management evaluates whether the modification meets the criteria to be classified as a troubled debt 
this criteria has two components the bank made a concession on the loan terms  and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
the company s loan policy has been recently updated to provide guidance to lending personnel as a result of the recent increase in restructured loans to ensure those that are troubled debt are properly categorized 
additional attention is being given to restructured loans through the oversight of the recently established position of chief credit officer at the parent company to ensure that modifications meeting criteria for restructured loans are identified and properly reported

the company s subsidiary banks have not engaged in loan splitting 
loan splitting is a practice that may occur in work out situations whereby a loan is divided into two parts a performing part and a nonperforming part 
this benefits a lender by potentially replacing one impaired loan by one smaller good loan and one smaller bad loan 
overall charge offs and reserve amounts are potentially reduced and the effects of adverse loan classifications may be diminished 
other real estate owned oreo was million at year end  a decrease of thousand or compared to million at year end real estate properties totaling million were transferred into oreo during  offset primarily by sales and write downs of oreo totaling million and million  respectively 
the million transferred into oreo during is made up mostly by real estate securing eight credit relationships totaling million  which includes million classified as nonaccrual at year end of the million sold in  million represents the five largest amounts in terms of carrying values  the largest of which relates to a single commercial property of million sold during the first quarter 
the company s comprehensive risk grading and loan review program includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans  a review of delinquencies  and an assessment of loans for needed charge offs or placement on nonaccrual status 
the company had loans in the amount of million and million at year end and year end  respectively  which were performing but considered potential problem loans and are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the table above 
these loans  however  are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain the company and many of its customers  particularly real estate development lending 
potential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by real estate 
at december  the five largest potential problem credits were million in the aggregate compared to million at year end and secured by various types of real estate including commercial  construction properties  and residential real estate development 
potential problem loans are identified on the company s watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management 
credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable  such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower 
potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower s ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment  deterioration in a borrower s financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements  a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan  or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates 
certain loans on the company s watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans were established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance 
temporary investments temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   temporary investments were million  a decrease of million or compared to million at year end the decrease in temporary investments was driven by lower interest bearing deposit balances held in other banks of million or  primarily with the federal reserve banking system  partially offset by a million or increase in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
temporary investments averaged million for the year  an increase of million or compared to million from year end the increase is a result of the company s overall net funding position  which reflects a more conservative lending approach as the company works through its high level of nonperforming assets and a continuing difficult economy 
temporary investments are reallocated to loans or other investments as market conditions and company resources warrant 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of debt securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  mortgage backed securities  and tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions 
substantially all of the company s investment securities are designated as available for sale 
total investment securities were million on december   a decrease of million or compared to million at year end net amortized cost amounts decreased million or 
net unrealized gains related to investments in the available for sale portfolio decreased million or 
the decrease in amortized cost amounts of investment securities for is attributed primarily to net sales activity  along with maturing and called securities that have outpaced purchases 
during the company sold million of available for sale investment securities at a net gain of million 
the sale of investment securities was part of an overall strategy to realign the balance sheet and to lock in some of the increase in the value of securities  strengthen capital  and to help counterbalance the high level of provision for loan losses and expenses related to repossessed real estate 
the sales were made after careful analysis of multiple reinvestment scenarios to minimize the negative impact on the net interest margin on a go forward basis 
the decrease in investment securities was also impacted by the company s balance sheet leverage transaction 
during  million of borrowings attributed to the leverage transaction matured and certain maturing bonds were used to fund the payoff of the borrowing rather than being reinvested in investment securities 
the million overall decrease in the net unrealized gains for available for sale investment securities is attributed mainly to the volume of securities sold during as previously discussed  the company in sold investment securities to lock in some of their increase in the value to strengthen capital and help counterbalance the high level of provision for loan losses and expenses related to repossessed real estate 
a portion of the previously recorded net unrealized gain on investments sold was realized in income at the time of sale 
included in the sale of investment securities in were million amortized costs amount of corporate debt securities sold during the second quarter at a net loss of thousand 
an additional million of corporate debt securities matured in the second quarter of the debt securities sold  although still rated as investment grade  were downgraded during and sold after a careful analysis of their short and long term prospects determined they no longer suited the company s investment preferences 
at year end  the company holds million amortized cost amounts of single issuer trust preferred capital securities of a global financial services firm with an estimated fair value of million 
these securities had an estimated fair value of million at year end these securities continue to perform according to contractual terms and the issuer of these securities is rated as investment grade by major rating agencies 
the company does not intend to sell these securities nor does the company believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery 
the company believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors  but rather the unrealized loss is primarily attributed to the decline in the financial markets and market volatility that occurred during and has not fully stabilized 
gradual improvements in many economic measures have resulted in higher market values of these securities in the company believes that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates 
gross unrealized losses totaling million at december  within the company s investment securities portfolio have not been included in income since they are identified as temporary 
the company believes that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates 
the company does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors 
the company does not expect to incur a loss on these securities unless they are sold prior to maturity 
the company does not currently have the intent to sell nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities before anticipated recovery 
all investment securities in the company s portfolio are currently performing 
funds made available from sold  maturing or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth  reinvested to purchase additional investment securities  or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
the following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on december    and the investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at the estimated fair value and held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost 
corporate debt securities consist primarily of debt issued by a large global financial services firm

the weighted average tax rates on exempt states and political subdivisions are computed based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
deposits the company s primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits  which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand  savings  and time deposits 
on december  total deposits were billion  a decrease of million or from year end both noninterest bearing and interest bearing deposits declined in the comparison 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased million or due to a million or lower balance from the commonwealth of kentucky 
all other noninterest deposits increased million or 
interest bearing deposit balances decreased million or  led by lower time deposits outstanding of million or partially offset by higher savings account balances of million or 
on an average basis  total deposits were billion for  a decrease of million or compared to average noninterest bearing deposits decreased million or  led by lower deposits from the commonwealth of million or 
all other noninterest bearing deposits  on average  increased million or 
average interest bearing deposits decreased million or year over year due to lower time deposits of million or partially offset by an increase of million or in savings deposit balances and higher interest bearing demand deposits of million or 
the decrease in both the end of period and average balances of the commonwealth is due mainly to a data processing change by the company during the first quarter of this change resulted in deposit transmissions from the commonwealth that are generally received and credited after processing deadlines for same day credit 
although deposits from the commonwealth can fluctuate significantly from day to day  outstanding balances are expected to remain at lower than recent historical levels as a result of the data processing change 
the sharp declines in the end of period and average time deposits for compared to year end is due in part to the maturity structure of the portfolio and the company s overall strategy of realigning and reducing the size of its balance sheet 
the company s liquidity position has enabled it to lower its cost of funds by more aggressively repricing higher rate maturing certificates of deposit downward in an overall lower interest rate environment or by allowing them to roll off without renewing 
rate offerings on new deposits have also had an overall decline due to the low rate environment 
the company has not sought out or accepted brokered deposits in the past nor does it have plans to do so in the future 
a summary of average balances for deposits by type and the related weighted average rates paid are as follows for the periods presented years ended december  in thousands average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings time total interest bearing total maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are summarized as follows

such borrowings are generally on an overnight basis 
other short term borrowings consist of fhlb borrowings totaling   and million at year end   and  respectively  and demand notes issued to the us treasury under the treasury tax and loan note option account totaling thousand  thousand  and thousand for   and respectively 
a summary of short term borrowings is as follows in thousands amount outstanding at year end maximum outstanding at any month end average outstanding weighted average rate at year end weighted average rate during the year long term borrowings the company s long term borrowings consist mainly of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb advances  and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts 
long term securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent obligations related to the company s balance sheet leverage transaction 
in this transaction  the company borrowed approximately million through multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of fixed rate gnma bonds 
at december   the amount outstanding under long term repurchase agreements was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
remaining maturities are million which is due in november and the remaining million is due in november at year end  million of the borrowings are putable quarterly and the remaining million is putable quarterly beginning in the fourth quarter of fhlb advances to the company s subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of fhlb stock that banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the fhlb 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs which have their own interest rates and range of maturities 
interest rates on fhlb advances are generally fixed and range between and  with a weighted average rate of 
remaining maturities of fhlb advances extend up to years  with a weighted average remaining term of years at year end long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb totaling million are convertible to a floating interest rate 
these advances may convert to a floating interest rate  indexed to the three month libor  only if libor equals or exceeds 
at year end  the three month libor was 
fhlb advances are generally used to increase the company s lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the fhlb 
long term advances from the fhlb totaled million at december   a decrease of million or compared to million at december  the company has previously completed three private offerings of trust preferred securities through three separate delaware statutory trusts the trusts sponsored by the company in the aggregate amount of million 
the combined million proceeds from the first two trusts trusts i and ii established in were used to fund the acquisition of citizens bancorp 
proceeds from the third trust trust iii were used primarily to acquire company shares through a tender offer during the company owns all of the common securities of each of the three trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  plus capital of million contributed by the company to establish the trusts  to purchase the company s subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii mature in and bear a floating interest rate at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion of the total and at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion 
the subordinated notes of trust iii in the amount of million mature in and bear a fixed interest rate through of and then convert to floating thereafter at three month libor plus basis points 
interest on each of the notes is payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii became redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option beginning on september  the subordinated notes of trust iii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after november  the subordinated notes are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
at december   the aggregate balance of the subordinated notes payable to the trusts was million 
the weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in was  unchanged compared to a year earlier

long term fhlb debt  subordinated notes payable  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption long term borrowings above and in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest 
postretirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next years 
estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions 
capital lease obligations represent amounts relating to the acquisition of data processing hardware and software used in the company s operations 
operating leases include standard business equipment used in the company s day to day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites 
operating lease terms generally range from one to five years  with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the company s option 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
guarantees during  the parent company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of its bank subsidiaries in connection with the million balance sheet leverage transaction 
the amount of borrowings outstanding guaranteed by the parent company at december  was million  with various maturity dates ranging from two to seven years 
the million outstanding borrowings are secured by gnma bonds held by the parent company s subsidiary banks valued at of the outstanding borrowings or million 
should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement  the gnma bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due 
if the value of the gnma bonds fall below the obligation under the contract  the parent company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks ability to do so 
the parent company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the parent company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement 
effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company has a corporate asset and liability management committee alco 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
alco also provides guidance and support to each alco of the company s subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company wide basis 
alco has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt 
however  the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the corporate policy 
the company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure 
the model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates during the next twelve months 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes  including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities 
other assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected prepayments  projected new volume  and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances 
these effects are combined with the company s estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months 
the forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and net income 
because assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income 
actual results could differ significantly from simulated results 
at december   the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would increase and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
the model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would decrease and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
in the current relatively low interest rate environment  it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets 
the average rate paid on many of the company s deposits is below 
this situation magnifies the model s predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates  as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower rate deposits 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
for financial institutions  liquidity reflects the ability to meet loan demand  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities 
a financial institution s ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company s goal is to meet its near term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset liability management 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
the company s alcos  both at the bank subsidiary and consolidated level  meet regularly and monitor the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
the company objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds include the subsidiary banks core deposits  consisting of both business and nonbusiness deposits  cash flow generated by repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities  fhlb and other borrowings  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition in our local markets 
as of december   the company had million of additional borrowing capacity under various fhlb  federal funds  and other borrowing agreements 
however  there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the company  or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity  although the company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the company s liquidity from these sources 
the company uses a liquidity ratio to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs 
this ratio is monitored by alco at both the bank and consolidated level 
the liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds 
this measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results 
for example  a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the company s ability to fund loans might become more difficult 
a high liquidity ratio could indicate that the company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets  which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties 
the company s liquidity position as measured by its liquidity ratio was relatively unchanged at year end compared to year end and is within alco guidelines and considered by management to be at an adequate level 
the company s liquidity ratio remains relatively high as it continues to take a measured and cautious lending strategy and work through its high level of problem assets in an economic environment that remains challenging 
liquidity at the parent company level is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see note regulatory matters of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  cash balances maintained  short term investments  investments in company owned life insurance  and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources 
payment of dividends by the company s subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations 
in addition  farmers bank  united bank  and citizens northern each must obtain regulatory approval to declare or pay dividends to the parent company as a result of increased capital required in connection with recent regulatory exams 
capital ratios at each of the company s four subsidiary banks exceed regulatory established well capitalized status at december  under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework  however  farmers bank  united bank  and citizens northern are required to maintain capital ratios at higher levels as outlined in their regulatory agreements 
the parent company s primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  injecting capital into subsidiaries  interest expense on borrowings  and paying for general operating expenses 
due to recent regulatory agreements  dividend payments on the parent company s common and preferred stock and interest payments on its trust preferred borrowings must have regulatory approval before being paid 
while regulatory agencies have so far granted approval to all of the company s requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company did not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries seek regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends 
moreover  the company will not pay any such dividend on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
reference is made to note regulatory matters of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  item a risk factors of this form k  and the heading capital resources below for additional information on the company s restrictions and requirements related to the payment of interest and dividends 
the parent company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million or from million at year end significant cash receipts of the parent company during include million proceeds from the liquidation of company owned life insurance at the parent company  million in dividends from first citizens bank  management fees from subsidiaries of million  million in dividends from ffkt insurance  and million return of capital from fcb services 
significant cash payments by the parent company during include million additional capital investment in bank subsidiaries  million for the payment of common and preferred dividends  salaries  payroll taxes  and employee benefits of million  interest expense on borrowed funds of million  and thousand additional capital injected into ekt properties 
the parent company may fund any additional external capital requirements of any of its banking subsidiaries from future public or private sales of securities at an appropriate time or from existing resources of the company  although the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
liquid assets consist of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investment securities 
at december   consolidated liquid assets were million  a decrease of million or from year end the decrease in liquid assets is attributed to a million or decrease in available for sale investment securities combined with a million or decrease in net cash and equivalents 
liquid assets  while still relatively high  have decreased mainly as a result of the company s overall net funding position  which was heavily influenced by the company s balance sheet realignment strategy that included reducing the overall size of the balance sheet 
the overall funding position of the company changes as loan demand  deposit levels  and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  an increase of million or compared to million for net cash provided by investing activities was million for compared to net cash used of million for the million higher net cash inflow in the comparison is mainly due to million related to investment securities transactions  million related to loan activity  million attributed to foreclosed real estate sales  and million in connection with the conversion to cash of a portion of company owned life insurance 
for investment securities transactions  the company had a net cash inflow of million in resulting from maturities and sales activity that exceeded purchases 
for  the company had net cash outflow related to investment securities of million as purchases exceeded maturities and sales 
net cash repayments received on loans were million for compared to million for as funding new loans have decreased in the current year 
the increase in cash received from foreclosed real estate activity is volume driven 
the company received million proceeds during upon liquidation of part of its investment in company owned life insurance at its cash surrender value to boost its cash available to inject into certain of its bank subsidiaries to strengthen their capital positions 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash inflows of million for for  net deposits decreased million  outstanding debt decreased million  and dividends paid amounted to million  all of which resulted in net cash outflows 
for  net cash flows from financing activities were increased by higher deposits of million and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million  partially offset by net payments that reduced outstanding debt by million and the payment of dividends totaling million 
information relating to off balance sheet arrangements is disclosed in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the company s liquidity position 
the company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options  or similar instruments 
capital resources company shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at december  retained earnings increased million during due to net income of million partially offset by dividends and accretion on preferred stock of million 
there were no dividends declared on common stock in other comprehensive income decreased million mainly due to an overall net decline in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities 
the decline in the overall net unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities was driven by the sale of securities in the current year and related gains that were recorded in noninterest income 
although the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec that became effective on october  as part of that filing  equity securities of the company of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of million could be offered for sale in one or more public or private offerings at an appropriate time 
the company continues to explore potential capital raising scenarios 
however  no determination has been made as to if or when a capital raise will be completed 
net proceeds from a potential sale of securities under the registration statement could be used for any corporate purpose determined by the company s board of directors 
at december  the company s tangible capital ratio was compared to at year end the tangible capital ratio is defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets 
this ratio excludes amounts related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
tangible common equity to tangible assets  which further excludes outstanding preferred stock  was at december  compared to at year end consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company s goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements 
the company capital ratios as of december  and the regulatory minimums are as follows 
farmers capital bank corporation regulatory minimum tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage capital tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing a bank s tier or total capital  as defined by regulation  by a risk weighted sum of the bank s assets  with the risk weighting determined by general standards established by regulation
