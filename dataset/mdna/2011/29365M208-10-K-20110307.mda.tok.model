overview we are a development stage medical device company focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  its associated co morbidities  and other gastrointestinal disorders 
our proprietary neuroblocking technology  which we refer to as vbloc therapy  is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve using high frequency  low energy  electrical impulses 
we have a limited operating history and we currently have no products approved for sale 
our initial product under development is the maestro system  which uses vbloc therapy to limit the expansion of the stomach  help control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness 
we were formerly known as beta medical  inc and were incorporated in minnesota on december  we later reincorporated in delaware on july  since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our maestro system 
based on our understanding of vagal nerve function and nerve blocking from our preclinical studies and the results of our initial clinical trials  we believe the maestro system may offer obese patients a minimally invasive treatment alternative that has the potential to result in significant and sustained weight loss 
we believe that our maestro system will allow bariatric surgeons to help obese patients who are concerned about the risks and complications associated with gastric banding and gastric bypass surgery 
in addition  data from sub group analyses demonstrate that vbloc therapy may hold promise in improving the obesity related co morbidities of diabetes and hypertension 
we are conducting  or plan to conduct  feasibility studies in each of these co morbidities to assess vbloc therapy s potential in addressing multiple indications 
we are currently evaluating the maestro system in human clinical trials conducted in the united states  australia  mexico  norway and switzerland 
to date  we have not observed any mortality related to our device or any unanticipated adverse device effects in these clinical trials 
we have also not observed any long term problematic clinical side effects in any patients  including in those patients who have been using the maestro system for more than one year 
on october   we announced preliminary results from our first pivotal clinical study  the empower trial  a multi center  randomized  double blind  prospective  placebo controlled pivotal study being conducted in the united states and selected international centers 
initial results from the trial indicated that the study did not meet its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in that the weight loss for the treatment arm was not statistically different from the control arm in which therapy was turned off 
the study did meet its safety endpoint 
our further review of the data suggests that i patients that used the device for the prescribed amount of time hours had clinically meaningful weight loss  ii both the treatment and control arm subjects experienced comparable  significant  dose dependent ewl at months  and iii there was an unanticipated therapeutic effect in which a low intensity blocking signal introduced vbloc therapy in human subjects in the control group 
in january  we met with the us food and drug administration fda to discuss the empower trial results and the regulatory process going forward 
based on this discussion  in march we submitted an investigational device exemption ide for a pivotal trial of our second generation fully implantable maestro rechargeable rc system 
in october  we received an unconditional approval from the fda for this trial  the recharge trial  a randomized  double blind  parallel group  multicenter pivotal clinical trial in morbidly obese subjects enrolled at up to us centers 
all patients in the study will receive an 
table of contents implanted device and will be randomized in a allocation to treatment or control groups 
the control group will receive a functional  but non active device that will deliver no charge to the vagus nerve during the study period 
all patients are expected to participate in a weight management program 
we will begin enrolling and implanting patients in the recharge trial and target the final implant to take place around the end of at the earliest 
assuming that we successfully enroll and implant the trial and achieve favorable results  we plan to use data from that trial to support a premarket approval pma application for the maestro system  which we expect to submit no earlier than the fourth quarter of we anticipate that we will be able to commercialize the maestro system in the united states in late at the earliest 
we have begun to take the initial steps necessary to commercialize the maestro rc system in australia  which includes applying for european ce mark certification and australian therapeutic goods administration tga approval 
we have applied for european ce mark certification of the maestro rc system and hope to receive approval in the first quarter of once we receive european ce mark certification  we intend to use that approval to file an application for approval and listing of the maestro rc system with the tga and intend to commercialize the device following receipt of that approval during the second half of on october   we announced that we entered into a cooperation agreement with the australian institute of weight control aiwc  a network of bariatric clinics specializing in laparoscopic weight loss surgery and clinical research for the morbidly obese 
under the cooperation agreement  we have designated aiwc and aiwc member clinics as authorized training and implantation centers for our products 
aiwc will be the first clinics in australia to implant the maestro system when it has received approval by the tga 
the aiwc will work with us to provide research  communications  training and accreditation support related to the maestro rc system in australia and other international territories 
in addition  the aiwc will work with us toward tga approval of the maestro rc system and collaborate on subsequent marketing and distribution efforts in australia 
the aiwc will also support our efforts in gaining reimbursement for the private sector through the medical services advisory committee msac in australia 
we received european ce mark approval for our maestro rf system on march   and as discussed above  are in the process of applying for european ce mark approval for our maestro rc system 
the method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device  but for our maestro system which falls into class iii  the method involved a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device  and a third party assessment by a notified body  usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer s quality system 
we use dekra certification inc formerly known as kema quality in the netherlands as the notified body for our ce marking approval process 
if and when we obtain fda approval of our maestro system we intend to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by field technical and marketing managers who provide training  technical and other support services to our customers 
outside the united states we intend to use direct  dealer and distributor sales models as the targeted geography best dictates 
to date  we have relied on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our maestro system 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the maestro system 
to date  we have generated no revenue from the sale of products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we continue our development activities 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
our board of directors and stockholders approved a for reverse split of our outstanding common stock that became effective on july  the reverse stock split did not change the par value of our stock or the 
table of contents number of common and preferred shares authorized by our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method and recognizing the expense over the option vesting period 
the intrinsic value method is calculated as the difference  if any  between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price on the date of the grant 
we also followed the minimum value disclosure provisions 
using the intrinsic value method  we were not required to recognize stock based compensation expense for employee stock options granted from inception through as the exercise prices  for financial reporting purposes  were determined to be at or above the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our common stock was assessed and approved by our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are nonemployee directors 
in determining the appropriateness of the fair value of our common stock  the board of directors considered several factors  such as our life cycle  results of research and development  recent financings and financial projections 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based payments  which superseded the previous accounting method  and requires compensation expense to be recognized using a fair value based method for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
companies are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we adopted the new provisions using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december  all option grants valued after january  are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes pricing model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the application of share based payment principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 

table of contents the fair value method is applied to all share based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate  nonemployees  unless another source of literature applies 
when determining the measurement date of a nonemployee s share based payment award  the company measures the stock options at fair value and remeasures such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant and each subsequent reporting period until the services are completed or a significant disincentive for nonperformance occurs  we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
common stock warrant liability effective january   we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance regarding the financial reporting for outstanding equity linked financial instruments 
this adoption required certain warrants issued by us to be recorded as a liability and recorded at fair value 
calculating the fair value of the warrant liability requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which requires our best estimates  and involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
the common stock warrant liability and related changes in fair value are significant to our consolidated financial statements and is based on a weighted average black scholes valuation model  however the warrant liability will never result in the payment of cash by us 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
under the provisions of sections and of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership will limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
the company is currently conducting a review of its ownership changes under section the results of this review indicate that ownership changes have occurred 
the company s gross net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credits  capitalized start up costs and capitalized research costs  totaling approximately million as of december   will be subject to a limitation 
the section limitation and accompanying recognized built in loss limitation is currently estimated to result in the expiration of between million and million of the company s aforementioned gross tax attributes 
a valuation allowance has been established to reserve the potential benefits of these carryforwards and tax credits in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
financial overview revenue to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any revenue 
we are taking the necessary steps to commercialize the maestro rc system in australia which includes the filing of an application for approval and listing with the tga upon receipt of european ce mark certification for the maestro rc system 
we hope to receive tga approval during the second half of in october we received unconditional approval from the fda of our ide to complete a pivotal trial using the maestro rc system 
as such  we do not expect to generate revenue in the united states before late and then  only if we successfully enroll and implant the clinical trial  achieve favorable results and receive fda approval of our maestro system 
any revenue from initial sales of a new product in the united states or internationally is difficult to predict and in any event will only modestly reduce our continued losses resulting from our research and development and other activities 

table of contents research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering  product development and clinical and regulatory expenses  incurred in the development of our maestro system 
research and development expenses also include employee compensation  including stock based compensation  consulting services  outside services  materials  supplies  depreciation and travel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
from inception through december   we have incurred a total of million in research and development expenses 
we expect research and development expense to increase in in support of a new clinical trial  recharge  in addition to continued follow up on existing trials  such as vbloc dm enable and empower 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  market development and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include costs associated with attending medical conferences  professional fees for legal  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain broad protection for the intellectual property related to our products  and accounting services  cash management fees  consulting fees and travel expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to decreases of million  million   and  in professional services  compensation and benefits expense  device costs and travel  respectively 
the ongoing financial commitment to maintain the empower trial continues to decrease as prescribed patient follow up visits become further apart  which has led to decreases in both professional services and device costs 
the reduction in compensation and benefits expenses along with the reduction in travel expense is primarily the result of a reduction in force completed october  research and development expenses further decreased for the year ended december  as a result of applying for and receiving a  government grant under the therapeutic discovery project credit program  which was a program established by the healthcare reform law enacted march  the program allowed applicants the opportunity to receive a tax credit or a grant for the equivalent amount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to decreases of  and  in compensation and benefits expense and professional services  respectively 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense is primarily the result of a reduction in force completed october  the decrease in professional services includes a decrease of  in consulting costs offset by an increase of  in audit and legal fees 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to a focus on capital preservation during while we developed our regulatory strategy and explored financing opportunities 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  was the result of voluntarily prepaying two of the outstanding term loans in full  or approximately of the outstanding principal balance  on december  the prepayment of the term loans resulted in a final payment fee of  and the acceleration of  of unamortized discount on notes payable  both recorded as interest expense in 
table of contents change in value of warrant liability 
the value of the warrant liability decreased  for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the warrant liability consisted of warrants issued to svb  wti and horizon 
both svb and wti exercised their warrants in full in september and october  respectively 
as a result  only warrants issued to horizon remained outstanding during the year ended december  the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of may   the date on which the warrants down round protection expired and the warrant liability was reclassified to equity 
the fair market value for these remaining warrants was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a  decrease for the year ended december  as our stock price decreased from on december  to on may  comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to decreases of million  million and million in professional services  device costs and compensation and benefits expense  respectively 
professional services and device cost decreases are driven by the completion of enrollment and implants in our empower trial during we are currently incurring costs related to follow up visits  which are less expensive than the cost of the implantation procedure  and do not require us to incur new device costs 
the reduction in compensation and benefits expense is the result of a reduction in force completed december  and a reduction in force completed october  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the years ended december  and although total annual selling  general and administrative expenses were consistent  various components fluctuated year over year 
there were increases of  and  in compensation and benefits expense and professional services  respectively 
the increases were driven by limited activities in support of commercializing the maestro system in the event our empower trial met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and the fda granted us approval to market our maestro system 
these limited activities were put on hold when we determined that our empower trial failed to meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
the increases were offset by decreases of  and  in employee stock based compensation expense and reduced travel expense  respectively 
the decrease in employee stock based compensation expense is primarily the result of the cancellation and related forfeiture of several stock options granted in with milestone features that were not achieved in interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to a decrease in short term interest rates and a reduction in total cash available to invest 
the average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreased average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance is the result of million in net cash used in operating and investing activities from january  through december  together with million in debt principal payments during the same time period  offset by million of debt funding received in november  million of net private placement proceeds received february   million of additional debt funding received in april and million of net registered direct offering proceeds received october  interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily the result of entering into a million debt facility  of which million was funded in november that resulted in net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off and the funding of the remaining million in april the effective rates on the million and million debt fundings were approximately and  respectively  compared to the old debt facility containing several outstanding loans with effective interest rates primarily ranging from approximately to 
on december  we 
table of contents voluntarily prepaid two of the outstanding term loans in full  or approximately of the outstanding principal balance 
the prepayment of the term loans resulted in a final payment fee of  and the acceleration of  of unamortized discount on notes payable  both recorded as interest expense in change in value of warrant liability 
the change in value of warrant liability was million for the year ended december   compared to zero for the year ended december  this is the result of a change in accounting principle effective january   which resulted in warrants issued november with a recorded value of million on december  being reclassified from equity to a liability 
on september   svb completed a cashless exercise of  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
the related warrant liability was marked to market on the date of exercise and reclassified to equity 
the change in fair value of these warrants from january  to the date of exercise was million 
on october   wti completed a cashless exercise of  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
the related warrant liability was marked to market on the date of exercise and reclassified to equity 
the change in fair value of these warrants from january  to the date of exercise was  the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of december  the fair market value for these remaining awards was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a  decrease for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of our stock price decreasing from a closing price of on january  to on december  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in december and  as of december  we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
through december   we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock  including million from our initial public offering in november and million from private placement and registered direct offerings in  and million in debt financing   to finance equipment purchases and million to finance working capital 
on january   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering  at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses 
on september   we completed the sale of  shares of series a non voting convertible preferred stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share in a private placement transaction at a purchase price of per share and per share  respectively 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses 
on december   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share in a public offering at a purchase price of per share and corresponding warrant 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
of this amount million was invested in money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency and million was invested in restricted cash collateral money market accounts as required by the terms of our debt and lease agreements 
these money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at per share  however  it is possible to lose money investing in these funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
at times  such deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance as of december   together with any interest income we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through  assuming our planned commercialization and we do not receive any other additional funds 

table of contents as of december   we had repaid the outstanding principal amount due to venture lending leasing v  inc a private equity fund under the management of wti and horizon pursuant to the loan and security agreement  effective as of november  the loan agreement 
the remaining unpaid balance of million in debt financing as of december  owed to svb pursuant to the loan agreement is collateralized by a first security priority lien on all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
we have entered into account control agreements in order to perfect the lender s first security interest in our cash and investment accounts 
on february  we entered into a first amendment the amendment with svb to the loan agreement 
the amendment provided that svb s term loan shall be repaid with a payment of  on february  followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of  each  commencing on march  and ending on december  it also amended the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of  payable monthly 
pursuant to the amendment  the conditions pursuant to which the excluded collateral as defined in the loan agreement will be deemed to be included as collateral as defined in the loan agreement were changed from the failure to have five months of remaining liquidity to the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the loan agreement after the date of the amendment or the lender s awareness after such date of an event of default that occurred on or before such date with written notice of such event delivered to the company 
in addition  the amendment revised the financial covenants in the loan agreement to delete the covenant relating to five months of remaining liquidity and to change the liquidity ratio covenant to equal a ratio of i the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with svb and svb s affiliates  divided by ii the outstanding principal amount of the term loan  which is not permitted to be less than 
finally  the amendment added a new covenant  the breach of which would constitute an event of default 
the new covenant requires that we receive aggregate net proceeds of at least million from new capital transactions after january  and before march  and to keep the proceeds of such transactions at svb until used 
we satisfied this new covenant with the closing  on january   of our sale of  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting offering expenses 
on july  we entered into a second amendment the second amendment to the loan agreement with svb 
the second amendment modified the repayment terms of the term loan such that from the date of the second amendment through december   we were only required to make interest only monthly payments on the term loan  thereby reducing our monthly debt payment 
then  beginning on january   the remaining balance due on the term loan will amortize over equal payments of principal and interest  which will be payable monthly 
in addition  the second amendment amended the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of  payable monthly 
the second amendment also revised the terms of the financial covenants related to the liquidity ratio and new capital transactions 
pursuant to the second amendment  the liquidity ratio equals the ratio of i the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with svb and svb s affiliates plus eligible accounts  divided by ii the outstanding principal amount of the term loan and is not permitted to be less than 
pursuant to the second amendment  we must receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions as defined in the loan agreement of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through august   million from the date of the second amendment through october   million from the date of the second amendment through january  and million from the date of the second amendment through june  if we meet these financing requirements  we will satisfy the covenant  however  if we do not receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of at least million from the date of the second amendment through august   million from the date of the second amendment through october   million from the date of the second amendment through january  and million from the date of the second amendment through june   svb s springing lien on our intellectual property will convert to a full lien on the intellectual property as of the date such proposed capital raise was missed 
we received approximately million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock warrants in a private placement transaction that closed on september   which was less than the amount required by the second amendment and resulted in us entering into a third amendment to the loan agreement the third amendment with svb on november  see details of the 
table of contents third amendment below 
finally  the second amendment revised the definition of make whole premium so that only term loan payments of principal made after the date of the second amendment will be counted for purposes of determining whether we have made twelve regularly scheduled monthly payments of principal in accordance with section d of the loan agreement when the make whole premium comes due 
the second amendment also required the issuance of a new warrant to svb with an exercise price per share equal to the volume weighted average closing price of our publicly traded common stock for the five trading days prior to the date of the second amendment 
the warrant gives svb the right to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to  divided by the exercise price per share 
on july   svb was issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
as noted above  we entered into a third amendment to the loan agreement with svb on november  the third amendment modified the new capital transaction covenant such that it waived the requirements to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through august  and million from the date of the second amendment through october  the third amendment also modified the requirement to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through january  to million and eliminated the requirement to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through june  we satisfied this new covenant with the closing  on december   of our sale of  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  in a public offering for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting offering expenses 
lastly  the third amendment suspended the liquidity ratio covenant  which was not permitted to be less than  until january  we have agreed to maintain a blocked cash collateral account with funds equal to the principal balance outstanding until such time that we have received aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through january   svb has received a financial forecast through december  approved by our board of directors and we have agreed to new financial covenants or a new financial structure with svb for our obligations 
there were no changes to the repayment terms of the term loan as defined in the second amendment 
on march  we entered into a fourth amendment the fourth amendment to the loan agreement with svb 
the fourth amendment modifies the repayment terms of the term loan such that beginning april  through september   we are only required to make interest only monthly payments on the term loan 
then  beginning on october   the remaining balance due on the term loan will amortize over equal payments of principal and interest  which will be payable monthly 
in addition  the fourth amendment amends the interest rate due effective march  on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of if the liquidity ratio is greater than and no event of default as defined in the loan agreement has occurred or is continuing or if the liquidity ratio is less than or an event of default has occurred or is continuing  payable monthly 
the fourth amendment also reinstates the financial covenant related to the liquidity ratio  which is not permitted to be less than  and adds an ebitda test should the liquidity ratio fall below 
the ebitda test requires that the trailing day actual ebitda be more favorable than of the projected ebitda for the same period if the projected ebitda for such period was less than zero or at least of the projected ebitda for the same period if the projected ebitda for such period was greater than or equal to zero 
in addition  the fourth amendment amends the prepayment terms of the loan agreement such that a make whole premium equal to of the amount of the term loan being prepaid will be due for any voluntary or required prepayment of the term loan occurring before the first anniversary of the fourth amendment  unless the term loan is being voluntary prepaid and replaced with a new svb facility 
lastly  the fourth amendment eliminates svb s springing lien on our intellectual property  the new capital transactions requirement and the requirement of the third amendment to maintain a blocked cash collateral account with funds equal to the principal balance outstanding

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any operating revenues 
we are taking the necessary steps to commercialize the maestro rc system in australia which includes the filing of an application for approval and listing with the tga upon receipt of european ce mark certification for the maestro rc system 
we hope to receive tga approval during the second half of in october we received unconditional approval from the fda of our ide to complete a pivotal trial using the maestro rc system 
as such  we do not expect to generate revenue in the united states before late and then  only if we successfully enroll and implant the clinical trial  achieve favorable results and receive fda approval of our maestro system 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we develop our products  prepare for the potential commercial launch of our maestro rc system  develop the corporate infrastructure required to sell our products  operate as a publicly traded company and pursue additional applications for our technology platform 

table of contents we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of million as of december   and any interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through  assuming our planned commercialization and we do not receive any other additional funds 
if our available cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investment balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our maestro system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our maestro system and any products that we may develop  the rate of market acceptance of our maestro system and vbloc therapy and any other product candidates  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing products and market developments  the cost of explanting clinical devices  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  any revenue generated by sales of our maestro system or our future products  and the extent to which we invest in products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions

off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities as defined by rules enacted by the securities and exchange commission and financial accounting standards board  and accordingly  no such arrangements are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we may maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio  if any  are not leveraged  are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
