item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses 
our businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies governing environmental protection  zoning and other matters 
these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
under these circumstances  we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability 
our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment  which could result in personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
our current and past activities  as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries  could result in our facing substantial environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
these could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations 
these liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories negligence  strict liability  breach of contract with customers  or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business  which is normally the case 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities 
while we maintain liability insurance  this insurance is subject to coverage limits 
in addition  certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination 
we face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products 
environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change 
the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases  including the imposition of fees or taxes  could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
the us congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  which includes establishing cap and trade programs 
in addition to the pending climate legislation  the us environmental protection agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities  and may issue final rules this year 
these changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
the company had revenues of of total revenue from one of its customers for the year ended december  the loss of this customer samsung heavy industries or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings 
the recent moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico and its consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico was enacted during the second quarter of following the macondo well blowout and oil spill 
even though such moratorium has been lifted  any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity as a result of such moratorium or permitting issues in this area could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
glossary of oilfield terms sources company management  a dictionary for the petroleum industry  the university of texas at austin  api abbr american petroleum institute annular blowout preventer a large valve  usually installed above the ram blowout preventers  that forms a seal in the annular space between the pipe and the wellbore or  if no pipe is present  in the wellbore itself 
annulus the open space around pipe in a wellbore through which fluids may pass

bit the cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells 
the bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element 
the cutting element is steel teeth  tungsten carbide buttons  industrial diamonds  or polycrystalline diamonds pdcs 
these teeth  buttons  or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it 
the circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates 
in rotary drilling  several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column  and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars 
drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole 
most bits used in rotary drilling are roller cone bits  but diamond bits are also used extensively

kelly bushing a special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table 
the kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it 
the bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing 
in either case  when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned  the kelly bushing also turns 
since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly  the kelly turns  and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem  the drill stem turns 
also called the drive bushing 
kelly spinner a pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that  when actuated  causes the kelly to turn or spin 
it is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up  that is  rotated rapidly for being made up 
kick an entry of water  gas  oil  or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling 
it occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled 
if prompt action is not taken to control the kick  or kill the well  a blowout may occur 
making up to assemble and join parts to form a complete unit eg  to make up a string of drill pipe 
to screw together two threaded pieces 
compare break out 
to mix or prepare eg  to make up a tank of mud 
to compensate for eg  to make up for lost time

riser a pipe through which liquids travel upward 
riser pipe the pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore  which is on the ocean floor  and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water 
a riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel 
the riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves 
also called marine riser pipe  riser joint 
rotary table the principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly  a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling 
the master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table  it turns the kelly bushing  which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning 
rotating blowout preventer rotating head a sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface  usually installed above the main blowout preventers 
a rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming  the head prevents the well from blowing out 
it is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability 
the rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid 
safety clamps a clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips 
should the slips fail  the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole 
also called drill collar clamp 
shaker see shale shaker shale shaker a piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations 
the size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow per cent flow of the fluid 
also called a shaker 
slim hole completions slim hole drilling drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth 
this decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing  thereby lessening the cost of completion 
slips wedge shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts dies or other gripping elements  such as serrated buttons  that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top drive unit s drive shaft

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling and well servicing equipment  products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry 
with operations in over locations across six continents  we design  manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment  sell and rent drilling motors  specialized downhole tools  and rig instrumentation  perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products  provide drill cuttings separation  management and disposal systems and services  provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment  and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network 
we also manufacture coiled tubing  manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing  and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods 
we have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness  efficiency  safety  and environmental impact of oil and gas operations 
our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile 
see risk factors 
we conduct our operations through three business segments rig technology  petroleum services supplies and distribution services 
see item business for a discussion of each of these business segments 
operating environment overview our results are dependent on  among other things  the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling  well remediation activity  the price of crude oil and natural gas  capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels 
key industry indicators for the past three years include the following v v active drilling rigs us canada international worldwide west texas intermediate crude prices per barrel natural gas prices mmbtu averages for the years indicated

the average price per barrel of west texas intermediate crude was per barrel in  an increase of over the average price for of per barrel 
average natural gas prices were per mmbtu  an increase of compared to the average of per mmbtu 
higher oil prices led to increased rig activity worldwide  increasing for the full year in compared to average crude oil prices for the fourth quarter of was per barrel and natural gas was per mmbtu 
at february   there were  rigs actively drilling in the us  compared to  rigs at december   an increase of from year end levels 
the price of oil decreased to per barrel and gas increased to per mmbtu at february  representing a decrease in oil prices and a increase in gas prices from the end of executive summary during national oilwell varco  inc generated nearly billion in net income attributable to the company  or per fully diluted share 
earnings increased percent from prior year levels of billion or per fully diluted share 
excluding intangible asset impairment and transaction  devaluation and voluntary retirement charges from both years  diluted earnings per share of in increased four percent from per share in revenues declined four percent from  to billion  but operating profit improved from billion to billion 
generally  benefitted from higher drilling activity when rig counts increased nearly percent from this market improvement enabled revenues from two of the company s reporting segments  petroleum services supplies and distribution services  to increase from the prior year 
however the company s largest segment  rig technology  declined in revenue in as it worked down its backlog of capital equipment mostly ordered by customers in and for its fourth quarter ended december   the company generated million in net income attributable to the company  or per fully diluted share  on billion in revenue 
compared to the third quarter of  revenue increased five percent and net income attributable to the company increased nine percent 
compared to the fourth quarter of  revenue increased one percent and net income attributable to the company increased percent 
the fourth quarter of included pre tax transaction charges of million  the third quarter of included pre tax transaction charges of million  and the fourth quarter of included pre tax transaction charges of million 
excluding transaction charges from all periods  fourth quarter earnings were per fully diluted share  compared to per fully diluted share in the third quarter of and per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of operating profit excluding transaction charges was million or percent of sales in the fourth quarter of  compared to million or percent of sales in the third quarter of excluding transaction charges 
operating profit excluding transaction charges was million or percent of sales for the fourth quarter of following the macondo well blowout and oil spill  a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf of mexico was enacted during the second quarter of and was lifted during the fourth quarter of nevertheless drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico remains lower than pre blowout levels due to the industry s difficulty in securing drilling permits 
the drilling moratorium reduced the company s earnings by approximately four cents per fully diluted share during  with most of the impact affecting the petroleum services supplies segment 
the distribution services segment posted higher sales in the gulf coast as it helped outfit the response effort with basic supplies during the second and third quarters of  but most of these previously incremental sales disappeared in the fourth quarter as cleanup operations were completed 
the rig technology group saw modestly higher purchases of spares and consumables among the affected rigs  which appear to be utilizing this period of low drilling activity in the gulf of mexico to conduct upgrade and maintenance activities 
some offshore drilling contractors appear to be pausing to see the ultimate resolution of new pressure control equipment requirements  and as a result some specific purchases  such as drill pipe and conductor pipe connections  are at risk pending the outcome of this pause 
oil gas equipment and services market worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
major central banks responded vigorously through  but a credit driven worldwide economic recession continues to dampen economic growth in many developed economies 
as a result asset and commodity prices  including oil and gas prices  declined 
after rising steadily for six years to peak at around per barrel early in  oil prices collapsed back to average per barrel west texas intermediate crude prices during the first quarter of  but recovered into the to per barrel range by the end of where they are holding steady the fourth quarter of averaged per barrel 
north american gas prices declined to average per mmbtu in the third quarter of  but recovered slightly and have traded in a range of to per mmbtu since the fourth quarter of averaged per mmbtu 
the steadily rising oil and gas prices seen between and led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by  but activity slowed sharply in with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability 
commodity prices appear to have recovered more quickly than economic activity through  leading to solid increases in drilling activity during the count of rigs actively drilling in the us as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending peaked at  rigs in september  but decreased to a low of in june us rig count has since increased to  in early february  and averaged  rigs during the fourth quarter of many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity in  but drilling recovered across north america as gas prices improved and  more recently  as operators began to drill unconventional shale plays targeting oil  rather than gas 
during the fourth quarter of  oil drilling rose to an average of percent of the total domestic drilling effort  compared to percent in the first half of most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies  which have historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings 
the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless  falling from its september peak of  to in august  but recently increased to  in january during the company saw its petroleum services supplies and its distribution services margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn  through both volume and price declines  nevertheless  both of these segments saw pricing stabilize and revenues recover modestly since the third quarter of the company s rig technology segment was less impacted owing to its high level of contracted backlog which it has executed on very well since the economic downturn 
rig technology posted higher revenues in than as a result  but revenues declined in as its backlog declined 
the recent economic decline beginning in late followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between and incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments  employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 
the industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since  to retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs according to offshore data services  percent of the existing jackup rigs are more than years old  replace older mechanical and dc electric land rigs with improved ac power  electronic controls  automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology  and build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs  including semisubmersibles and drillships  employing recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins 
we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet  and declining dayrates may accelerate the retirement of older rigs 
as a result of these trends the company s rig technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from billion at march   to billion at september  however  due to the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity  orders have declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue  causing the backlog to decline to billion by june  the backlog increased modestly through the second half of as drillers began ordering more than the company shipped out of backlog  and finished the year at billion 
approximately billion of contracted backlog is scheduled to flow out as revenue during and billion is scheduled to flow out as revenue during the land rig backlog comprised percent and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised percent of the total backlog as of december  equipment destined for international markets totaled percent of the backlog 
the company experienced relatively minor levels of order cancelations since less than four percent  and does not expect additional material cancellation of contracts or abandonment of major projects  however  there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur 
segment performance the rig technology segment generated billion in revenues and billion in operating profit or percent of sales  excluding transaction charges  during compared to the prior year revenues declined percent  and operating profit flow through or leverage the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue was percent for the segment 
for the fourth quarter of the segment produced revenues of  million  representing a six percent improvement from the third quarter and an percent decline from the fourth quarter of segment operating profit was million and operating margins were percent during the fourth quarter 
operating profit flow through was percent sequentially  and percent year over year 
revenues from higher margin offshore projects declined from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter  and lower margin revenues from land rigs and well intervention equipment increased  resulting in a modestly unfavorable mix shift that pulled margins down and produced low incremental leverage on the revenue gains for the group 
many of the offshore projects were contracted at high prices in and  and are now being manufactured in much lower cost environments  and benefit from greater project execution experience within the group 
non backlog revenue  which is predominantly aftermarket spares and services  declined one percent sequentially and increased four percent from the fourth quarter of orders for two deepwater floating rigs and several jackup drilling packages  higher pressure pumping and stimulation equipment demand  and orders for fpso equipment which came with the company s acquisition of apl in december  contributed to total order additions to backlog of  million during the fourth quarter  up percent from the third quarter 
revenue out of backlog of  million increased percent sequentially 
interest in offshore rig construction appears to be increasing with a number of announcements of newbuild projects made by drillers since year end 
additionally the company submitted tenders for up to deepwater rigs for petrobras to shipyards and drilling contractors during  which are to be built in brazil 
the company expects to book some orders from these tenders in the first half of  but the tender awards remain subject to acceptance by petrobras  and further delays are possible 
these tenders require a high and rising level of local brazilian content in the construction of new rigs 
the petroleum services supplies segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit  or percent of sales  for the full year compared to the prior year revenue increased percent  and operating profit flow through was percent 
for the fourth quarter of  the segment generated total sales of  million  up four percent from the third quarter of and up percent from the fourth quarter of operating profit was million or percent of sales during the fourth quarter of year over year operating profit flow through from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of was percent  and sequential operating profit flow through was percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of  lower than expected due to a variety of product mix changes across the segment  start up costs in new operations in the middle east and brazil  and slightly higher incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter 
modest sequential revenue growth was evenly spread across most major areas  albeit with mix shifts from product to product 
brazil  russia and the middle east posted some of the largest sequential gains  along with good sequential improvement in the us centered in the liquids rich shale plays like the bakken and the eagle ford 
nov downhole posted strong sequential sales growth on higher sales in the eastern hemisphere  canada  and us shales  with drilling motors and borehole enlargement tools in particularly high demand 
drill pipe orders slowed slightly this quarter as dwindling budgets and holidays slowed inquiries late in the year  but the first few weeks of have seen orders pick back up 
drill pipe margins improved in the fourth quarter due to a lower mix of chinese drill pipe sales 
the distribution services segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit or percent of sales during revenues improved percent from  and operating profit flow through was percent from to for the fourth quarter of revenues were million  up percent from the fourth quarter of and down slightly from the third quarter of operating profit of million for the fourth quarter produced operating margins of percent for the quarter  and operating profit flow through was a very strong percent from the fourth quarter of revenues from the us declined sequentially with lower sales into the gulf coast oil spill cleanup effort  but this was mostly offset by higher sales in canada  where drilling activity increased seasonally  and higher international sales of artificial lift equipment and industrial equipment sales in europe and australia 
the segment also benefitted from an acquisition in the caspian region closed during the fourth quarter 
approximately percent of the group s fourth quarter sales were into north american markets and percent were into international markets 
outlook while the credit market downturn  global recession  and lower commodity prices presented challenges to our business in  we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization and recovery in many of our markets 
specifically we are encouraged by higher drilling activity in north america  and steadily higher international drilling activity 
order levels for new drilling rigs declined significantly in as compared to due to credit market conditions and softer rig activity  but we began to see improvement in the second half of due to dayrate stabilization for certain classes of newer technology rigs  lower rig construction costs  and improving availability of financing  including easier payment terms from shipyards 
we expect lower backlogs to lead to modest declines in rig technology revenues and margins over the next few quarters before new offshore rig construction projects can translate into higher revenues 
our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment and distribution services segment remains closely tied to the rig count  particularly in north america 
if the rig count continues to increase we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services  consumables and capital items they supply 
many products are beginning to see higher steel  alloy  resin and fiberglass costs impact their business  and are attempting to raise prices to offset rising costs 
continuing tight iron ore supplies to the steel mills could adversely affect margins as the year unfolds 
the company believes it is well positioned to continue to manage through the current economic recovery  and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization  access to credit  and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings in future periods 
the company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions  and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods 
such a period may also present opportunities for the company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives

we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
at december   the company had  million of available funds under its revolving credit facility 
we also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through existing available debt financing 
a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in millions payment due by period less after than total year years years years contractual obligations total debt operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit as of december   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us or at all 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  service and product warranties and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology segment 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 
this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts 
based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at december  and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in our estimates could become material in future periods 
inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled million and million  or and of gross inventory  respectively 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital  both key assumptions used in our calculation 
changes to these assumptions  including  but not limited to sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity  or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
due to significant declines in the company s stock price and oil and gas commodity prices  coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets  the company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of the company performed an impairment analysis at december  which did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
based on its analysis  the company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december  and as described below  the company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of and updated its impairment testing at june  based on its updated analysis  the company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended june  however  based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of million at june  the million impairment charge is included in the company s consolidated income statement for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  the worldwide average rig count was  rigs  down from the fourth quarter average of  and down from the first quarter average of  the second quarter average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years 
in addition  the company s updated forecast was behind the company s previous forecast completed at the beginning of while operating profit for the first quarter of was in line with the company s first quarter operating profit forecast  the company s consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of was below its second quarter forecast 
as a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count  and the decline in actual forecasted results compared to the original forecast  the company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under accounting standards codification asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
therefore  the company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures using significant unobservable inputs  or level in the fair value hierarchy 
these inputs are based on internal management estimates  forecasts and judgments  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
while the company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value  the company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management s expectations  where possible 
the discounted cash flow is based on management s short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit 
the two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment  which bear the risk of change and could impact the company s goodwill impairment analysis  include the cash flow from operations from each of the company s individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital 
the starting point for each of the reporting unit s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast 
the detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity  inflationary forces  pricing strategies  customer analysis  operational issues  competitor analysis  capital spending requirements  working capital needs  customer needs to replace aging equipment  increased complexity of drilling  new technology  and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections 
cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend 
projections for the remainder of also reflected declines compared to the original annual forecast 
the company updated its operating forecast  long term forecast  and discounted cash flows based on this information 
the goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of did not result in goodwill impairment as of june  other indefinite lived intangible assets  representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely  were valued using significant unobservable inputs level and are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method  a form of the income approach 
an impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test 
included in the impairment test are assumptions  for each trade name  regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above  the royalty rate  and the discount rate applied 
based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company incurred an impairment charge of million in the petroleum services supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the company s grant prideco trade name 
the impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through june  declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of   and compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of   and during the fourth quarter of  the company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows 
in the third and fourth quarters of  both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase 
rig count increased to an average of  in the third quarter and increased another to an average of  in the fourth quarter 
average west texas intermediate crude prices reached in the fourth quarter of  an increase of from an average of in the second quarter of in addition  by the end of the fourth quarter  average natural gas prices increased to  a increase from the second quarter average of 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis for its goodwill and indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of resulting in no impairment 
the valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous testing 
the inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts 
along with the normal impairment analysis  the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results  the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional from the current projections for  and  while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified 
additionally  if the company were to increase its discount rate basis points  while keeping all other assumptions constant  there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the company s reporting units or any of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company does not believe that these events drop in additional revenue for the next three years or basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital or changes are likely to occur  it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in and or any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the company s goodwill impairment analysis

income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries 
the company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
the annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the company considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means 
the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in asc topic income taxes asc topic

the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liability would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
strengthening of currencies against the us dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency 
some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes

these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million and the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by million 
the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
during the first quarter of  the venezuelan government officially devalued the venezuelan bolivar against the us dollar 
as a result the company converted its venezuela ledgers to us dollar functional currency  devalued monetary assets resulting in a million charge  and wrote down certain accounts receivable in view of deteriorating business conditions in venezuela  resulting in an additional million charge 
the company s net investment in venezuela was million at december  interest rate risk at december  our long term borrowings consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes and million in senior notes 
we occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facility  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to six months
