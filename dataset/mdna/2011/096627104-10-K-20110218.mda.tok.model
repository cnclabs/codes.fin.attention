item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through our operating subsidiaries  gulf crossing pipeline company llc gulf crossing  gulf south pipeline company  lp gulf south and texas gas transmission  llc texas gas  we own and operate three interstate natural gas pipeline systems including integrated storage facilities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region  oklahoma and arkansas  and extend northeasterly to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
our pipeline systems contain approximately  miles of interconnected pipelines  directly serving customers in twelve states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern us through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
in  our pipeline systems transported approximately tcf of gas 
average daily throughput on our pipeline systems during was approximately bcf 
our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of eleven underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately bcf 
we conduct all of our natural gas transportation and integrated storage operations through our operating subsidiaries as one segment 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and parking and lending pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
competition and contract renewals our ability to market available interstate transportation and storage capacity is impacted by demand for natural gas  competition from other pipelines  natural gas price volatility  basis spreads  economic conditions and other factors 
we compete with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines  including several pipeline projects which have recently been placed in service or are in the process of being developed 
additionally  significant new sources of natural gas have recently been identified throughout the us  including the marcellus shale in pennsylvania  new york  west virginia and ohio  which are closer to key end user market areas than our supply sources 
these new sources of natural gas have created changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and ma rket areas 
as a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply  in the basis spreads on our pipeline systems began to narrow 
this trend continued into  although in the latter part of basis spreads on our pipeline systems improved 
under current market conditions  marketing our available capacity and renewing expiring contracts have become more difficult 
our ability to renew some of our expiring contracts at attractive rates and our revenues from interruptible and short term firm transportation services have been negatively impacted by these market conditions 
capacity that we have available on a short term basis has decreased as long term capacity commitments on our recently completed pipeline expansion projects have increased in accordance with the contracts supporting those projects 
however  some of our capacity will continue to be available for sale on a short term firm or interruptible basis and each year a portion of our existing contracts expire 
the revenues we will be able to earn from that availabl e capacity and from renewals of expiring contracts will be heavily dependent upon basis spreads 
it is not possible to accurately predict future basis spreads 
regulation we are subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates we can charge for our transportation and storage operations 
for our cost based services  ferc establishes both the maximum and minimum rates we can charge 
the basic elements that ferc considers are the costs of providing service  the volumes of gas being transported  the rate design  the allocation of costs between services  the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn 
while neither gulf south nor texas gas has an obligation to file a rate case  our gulf crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost and revenue study by the end of the first quarter to justify its rates 
customers of our subsidiaries or ferc can challenge the existing rates on any of our pipelines 
in the past two years  ferc has challenged t he rates of several pipelines not affiliated with us 
such a challenge could adversely affect our ability to establish reasonable transportation rates  to charge rates that would cover future increases in our costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain our current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return 
additionally  ferc can propose changes or modifications to any of its existing rate related policies 
we are also subject to pipeline integrity programs monitored by phmsa 
in  there were several integrity related incidents on pipelines not affiliated with us that could lead to increased regulation of natural gas pipelines by phmsa 
the potential for increased regulation regarding pipeline integrity could lead to increased capital spending and maintenance costs 
natural gas prices we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the level of natural gas prices may impact the volumes of gas transported on our pipeline systems 
high natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas 
a reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on our systems  reduce the demand for our services and could result in the non renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire 
the majority of our revenues are derived from capacity reservation charges that are not impacted by the volume of natural gas transported  however smaller portions of our revenues are derived from charges based on actual volumes transported under firm and interruptible services 
for example  in approximately of our revenues were derived from charges based on actual volumes transported 
we cannot predict the level of future natural gas prices 
spreads in natural gas prices between time periods  such as winter to summer  impact our pal and interruptible storage revenues 
these price spreads were unfavorable in as compared with resulting in a reduction of our pal and interruptible storage revenues for the period 
we cannot predict future time period spreads or basis differentials 
recently completed pipeline projects an abundance of recent natural gas supply discoveries in the bossier sands  barnett shale  haynesville shale  fayetteville shale and caney woodford shale producing regions has formed the basis for the recent expansion of our pipeline systems 
in and  we placed in service our east texas pipeline  southeast project  gulf crossing pipeline and the fayetteville and greenville laterals pipeline expansion projects  which collectively consist of approximately  miles of inch and inch pipeline and related compression facilities 
in  we placed in service the remaining compression facilities associated with the gulf crossing pipeline and the faye tteville and greenville laterals which increased the peak day delivery capacities of those projects 
with the exception of post construction activities such as right of way restoration  the pipeline expansion projects are essentially complete and operating at their design capacity 
financial analysis of operations we derive our revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for third parties 
transportation and storage services are provided under firm and interruptible service agreements 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
the following analysis discusses our financial results of operations for the years  and compared with our net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers were higher transportation revenues from our pipeline expansion projects and gains on gas sales associated with our western kentucky storage expansion project and a reduction in storage gas needed to support no notice services  partially offset by increased operating expenses related to higher depreciation and property taxes associated with the pipeline expansion projects and increased interest expense 
in  gas transportation revenues and throughput were negatively impacted due to operating our pipeline expansion projects at reduced operating pressures and portions of the pipeline expansion projects being shut down for periods of time followin g the discovery and remediation of anomalies in certain joints of pipe 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to  million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million and fuel retained increased million primarily due to our pipeline expansion projects 
the increases were partially offset by million of lower interruptible and short term firm transportation services resulting from lower basis spreads between delivery points on our pipeline systems 
pal and storage revenues decreased million due to decreased parking opportunities from unfavorable natural gas price spreads between time periods 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers of the increase were increased fuel consumed of million from our pipeline expansion projects and higher natural gas prices 
depreciation and property taxes increased by million associated with an increase in our asset base 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in major maintenance projects 
impairment losses of million were recognized in primarily related to the sale of assets in the overton field area in northeast texas and a portion of pipe materials which we expect to dispose of by sale 
the increased expenses were partly offset by a million gain from the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion project and a reduction in storage gas needed to support no notice services 
the period was unfavorably impacted by million as a result of pipeline investigation and retirement costs related to the east texas pipeline 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period  driven by higher interest expense of million resulting from increased debt levels in and lower capitalized interest due to the completion of our pipeline expansion projects 
compared with our net income for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  operating expenses for the year ended december   were higher than the comparable period in  mainly as a result of increases in depreciation and property taxes associated with our pipeline expansion projects 
the increase in expenses more than offset the increase in revenues from our pipeline expansion projects  which were approximately million lower than expected due to operating our pipeline expansion projects at reduced operating pressures and portions of the pipeline expansion projects being shut down for periods of time during the period was favorably im pacted by million of gains from the disposition of coal reserves  gas sales associated with our storage expansion and the settlement of a contract claim 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million  primarily from our pipeline expansion projects 
pal revenues increased million due to increased parking opportunities and favorable summer to summer natural gas price spreads 
the increases were partially offset by lower fuel revenues of million due to unfavorable natural gas prices 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary factors for the increases were higher depreciation and property taxes of million associated with a larger asset base from our pipeline expansion projects 
operation and maintenance expenses increased approximately million primarily from increased maintenance projects and expansion related operations 
administrative and general expenses increased million mainly due to increases in employee benefits as a result of lower returns on trust assets for our pension and post retirement benefit plans and increases in unit based compensation from an increase in the price of our common units 
operation and maintenance expenses and los ses on disposal of assets were million higher due to pipeline investigation and retirement costs related to the east texas pipeline 
fuel and gas transportation expenses decreased million primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices 
the period was favorably impacted by gains of million on the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion project  million from the disposition of coal reserves  million from the settlement of a contract claim and million due to a change in employee paid time off policy which resulted in a reserve reversal 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period 
the primary factor for the increase was higher interest expense of million resulting from lower capitalized interest associated with placing expansion projects in service and higher debt levels in liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities  our revolving credit facility  debt issuances and sales of limited partner units 
our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under our revolving credit facility to service outstanding indebtedness and make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
we have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated pa rties 
our ability to access the capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including our revolving credit facility  and cash flow generated from future operations will be adequate to fund our operations  including our capital expenditures for maintenance and growth projects 
capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million million and million 
growth capital expenditures  including costs associated with our pipeline expansion projects  were million  million and billion for the years ended december   and we expect to fund our capital expenditures of less than million from our operating cash flows or  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
equity and debt financing in  we did not enter into any new equity or debt financing transactions 
in january  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses of million from the sale of million of senior unsecured notes of texas gas due february  notes 
we used these proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we notified the holders of texas gas notes due april  notes that we will redeem million of those notes in february at the redemption price provided for in the indenture governing such notes 
we will borrow funds under our revolving credit facility to fund this redemption 
note in item of this report contain s more information about the notes and partial redemption of the notes 
we anticipate the need to issue and sell debt during the next several years to refinance outstanding debt and our revolving credit facility either prior to or at their maturities 
see contractual obligations for a summary of the amounts and timing of our debt maturities 
revolving credit facility we maintain a revolving credit facility which has aggregate lending commitments of million  under which boardwalk pipelines  gulf south and texas gas each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june   however all outstanding revolving loans on such date may be converted to term loans having a maturity date of june  as of december   we had million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of and no letters of credit issued thereunder 
as a result of the issuance of the notes discussed above  borrowings under our revolving credit facility were reduced by million and at february   we had million in loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
at such date we had available borrowing capacity of million 
as discussed above  in february  we will borrow funds under this facility to pay the redemption price for million of notes 
our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants  including  among others  limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with our affiliates 
the facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our credit facility at december  although we do not believe that these covenants have had  or will have  a material impact on our business and financing activities or our ability to obtain the financing to maintain opera tions and continue our capital investments  they could restrict us in some circumstances as stated in item a  risk factors 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations under firm commitments as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments pipeline capacity agreements operating lease commitments total includes our senior unsecured notes  having maturity dates from to  million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility  having a maturity date of june   and our subordinated loans which mature initially on december  the revolving credit facility and subordinated loans are extendable by us on the same terms for an additional year 
subsequent to december   we issued and sold additional debt as discussed under equity and debt financing 
interest obligations represent interest due on our senior unsecured notes at fixed rates 
future interest obligations under our revolving credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate and fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december   million and million would be due under the credit facility in less than one year and years 
subsequent to december   borrowings under the revolving credit facility were reduced as discussed under revolving credit facility 
capital commitments represent binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements existing at december  the amounts shown are associated with various pipeline capacity agreements on third party pipelines that allow our operating subsidiaries to transport gas to off system markets on behalf of our customers 
pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
in  we expect to fund approximately million to the texas gas pension plan 
distributions for the twelve months ended december   and  we paid distributions of million  million and million to our partners 
note in part ii  item of this report contains further discussion regarding our distributions 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to an increase in net income  partly offset from lower prepayments received under pal and transportation agreements 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
the decrease was driven by a million decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to the completion of our pipeline expansion projects and million in proceeds from the sale of assets  mainly comprised of storage gas sales 
the decreases were partially offset by the sale of million of short term investments which occurred in the period 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million to a use of cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the comparable period 
the increase in cash used in financing activities resulted from a million reduction in proceeds from the issuance and sale of debt and equity  including related general partner contributions  a million increase in distributions to our partners and million of payments made under our registration rights agreement 
the increases were partly offset by a decrease of million in net repayments related to our revolving credit facility 
impact of inflation we have experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  benefits  materials and supplies  and property  plant and equipment ppe 
a portion of the increased labor and materials and supplies costs have directly affected income through increased operating costs and depreciation expense 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our ppe and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market f actors  may limit our ability to price jurisdictional services to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from rev isions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
regulation pursuant to ferc regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded based on regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither gulf south nor texas gas is involved in an open general rate case  however gulf crossing will either have to file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates by the end of the first quarter our subsidiaries are regulated by ferc 
when certain criteria are met  gaap requires that certain rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates regulatory accounting 
this basis of accounting is applicable to operations of our texas gas subsidiary which records certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods  but is not applicable to operations associated with the fayetteville and greenville laterals due to rates charged under negotiated rate agreements and a portion of the storage capacity due to the regulatory treatment associated with the rates ch arged for that capacity 
regulatory accounting is not applicable to gulf crossing due to discounts under negotiated rate agreements  or gulf south because competition in the market areas of gulf south has resulted in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates being granted to customers and certain services provided by gulf south are priced using market based rates 
we monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate to determine that any regulatory assets continue to be probable of recovery 
if we were to determine that all or a portion of our regulatory assets no longer met the criteria for recognition as regulatory assets  that portion which was not recoverable would be written off  net of any regulatory liabilities 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
in the course of providing transportation and storage services to customers  the pipelines may receive different quantities of gas from shippers and operators than the quantities delivered by the pipelines on behalf of those shippers and operators 
this results in transportation and exchange gas receivables and payables  commonly known as imbalances  which are primarily settled in cash or the receipt or delivery of gas in the future 
settlement of imbalances requires agreement between the pipelines and shippers or operators as to allocations of volumes to specific transportation contracts and timing of delivery of gas based on operational conditions 
the receivables and payables are valued at market price for operations where regulatory accounting is not applicable and are valued at the historical value of gas in storage for operations where regulatory accounting is applicable  consistent with the regulatory treatment and the settlement history 
fair value measurements fair value refers to an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market in which the reporting entity transacts based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming its highest and best use 
a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions giving priority  from highest to lowest  to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  observable inputs not included in level  for example  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities level  and unobservable data level  for example  a reporting entity s own internal data based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we have included fair value measurements in our disclosures regarding the fair value of our debt and the trust assets associated with our pension and postretirement benefits plans  as well as to determine the fair value of texas gas for purposes of completing our annual impairment test for goodwill 
the amounts disclosed for the fair value of our debt and benefit plan trust assets were based on quoted market prices for those assets or similar assets  however at december   approximately million of the benefits plan trust assets were based on unobservable data inputs 
for the annual test  the fair value measurement associated with our goodwill impairment test was derived based on our assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the reporting unit  including the use of a discounted cash flow model  w hich are generally unobservable data inputs under the fair value hierarchy 
please refer to goodwill for more information regarding the annual test and judgments and assumptions used in completing the test 
our consolidated financial statements include fair value measurements related to derivatives 
at december   the fair value of our derivatives was determined based on quoted market prices for similar contracts 
notes    and in item of this report contain more information regarding our fair value measurements 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the epa  ferc and other governmental au thorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our environmental liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of long lived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding impairments we have recognized 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets which was initially recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of our texas gas subsidiary 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for purposes of a goodwill impairment test  the reporting unit s fair value is determined in accordance with accounting requirements involving fair value measurements as described under fair value measurements 
we perform this test annually at december for the annual goodwill impairment test  the fair value measurement of the reporting unit associated with our goodwill was derived based on judgments and assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the reporting unit  which are generally unobservable data inputs under the fair value hierarchy 
these judgments and assumptions included the valuation premise  use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value and inputs to the valuation model 
the inputs included our five year financial plan operating results  the long term outlook for growth in natural gas demand in the us and measures of the risk free rate  equity premium and systematic risk used in the calculation of the applied discount rate under the capital asset pricing model 
the resulting estimate of fair value was compared to the carrying amou nt of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying amount at december   and accordingly no impairment was recognized 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could substantially change the fair value determined during the annual test and potentially result in the recognition of an impairment charge in our financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the us such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the disc ount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk with the exception of our revolving credit facility  for which the interest rate is periodically reset  our debt has been issued at fixed rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the debt instruments but do not directly affect earnings or cash flows 
the following table presents market risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt  including our subordinated loans  at december in millions  except interest rates carrying value of fixed rate debt fair value of fixed rate debt basis point increase in interest rates and resulting debt decrease basis point decrease in interest rates and resulting debt increase weighted average interest rate  including subordinated loan at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of which rate is reset periodically 
a increase in interest rates would increase our cash payments for interest on the credit facility by million on an annual basis 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
a significant portion of our debt  including our revolving credit facility  will mature over the next five years 
we expect to refinance the debt either prior to or at maturity 
our ability to refinance the debt at interest rates that are currently available is subject to risk at the magnitude illustrated in the table 
in january  we mitigated a portion of that risk through the issuance and sale of million of notes 
we used the net proceeds from the notes to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
we also issued a notice to holders of notes that we will redeem million of those notes 
we will borrow against our revolving credit facility to fund the redemption 
after the redemption of the notes  we will have reduced borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million  which will reduce the amount of debt subject to variable interest rates and will have refinanced a portion of our fixed rate debt which was set to mature within three years 
we expect to refinance the remainder of our debt that will mature based on our assessment of the term rates of interest available in the market 
at december  and  million and million of our undistributed cash  shown on the balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents  was primarily invested in treasury fund accounts 
due to the short term nature of the treasury fund accounts  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
commodity risk our pipelines do not take title to the natural gas which they transport and store in rendering firm and interruptible transportation and storage services  therefore they do not assume the related natural gas commodity price risk associated with that gas 
however  certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  was available for sale and exposed to commodity price risk 
additionally  we have bcf of gas with a book value of million that has become available for sale as a result of a change in storage gas needed to support operations and no notice services 
we utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas 
the derivatives related to the sale of natural gas and cash for fuel reimbursement where customers make a cash payment for the estimated cost of fuel used in providing transportation services as opposed to providing quantities of natural gas  generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting and are designated as such 
the effective component of related gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of the derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the anticipated transactions affect earnings 
generally  for gas sales and retained fuel  any gains and losses on the related derivatives would be recognized in operating revenues  or as they relate to the sale of storage gas  in net gain loss on disposal of operating assets 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to renewal or marketing 
we actively monitor future expiration dates associated with our contract portfolio 
we compete with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines  including several pipeline projects which have recently been placed in service or are in the process of being developed 
additionally  significant new sources of natural gas have recently been identified throughout the us which have created changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas 
as a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply  in basis spreads on our pipeline systems began to narrow 
this trend continued into although in the latter part of  basis spreads on our pipeline systems improved 
under current market conditions  marketing our available capacity and renewing expiring contracts have become difficult 
our ability to renew some of our expiring contracts at attractive rates  and our revenues from interruptible and short term firm transportation services  have been negatively impacted by these market conditions 
capacity that we have available on a short term basis has decreased as long term capacity commitments on our recently completed pipeline expansion projects have increased in accordance with the contracts supporting those projects 
however  some of our capacity will continue to be available for sale on a short term firm or interruptible basis and each year a portion of our existing contracts expire 
the revenues we will be able to earn from that available capacity and from renewals of expiring contracts will be heavily dependent upon basis spreads 
it is not possible to accurately predict future basis spreads 
credit risk our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and no notice services 
natural gas price volatility can materially increase credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal units mmbtu  the market value of that gas was approximately million 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
although nearly all of our customers pay for our services on a timely basis  we actively monitor the credit exposure to our customers 
we include in our ongoing assessments amounts due pursuant to services we render plus the value of any gas we have lent to a customer through no notice or pal services and the value of gas due to us under a transportation imbalance 
our pipeline tariffs contain language that allow us to require a customer that does not meet certain credit criteria to provide cash collateral  post a letter of credit or provide a guarantee from a credit worthy entity in an amount equaling up to three months of capacity reservation charges 
for certain agreements  we have included contractual provisions that require additional credit support should the credit ratings of those customers fall below investment grade
