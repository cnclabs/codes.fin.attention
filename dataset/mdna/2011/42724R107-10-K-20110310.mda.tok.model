local economic climate the economy in the company s service area is based primarily on agriculture  tourism  light industry  and retail trade 
services supporting these industries have also developed in the areas of medical  financial and educational services 
the population of san luis obispo county  the city of santa maria in northern santa barbara county  and the city of santa barbara totaled approximately   and  respectively  according to the most recent economic data provided by the us census bureau 
the moderate climate allows a year round growing season in the local economy s agricultural sector 
vineyards and ranches also contribute largely to the local economy 
the central coast s leading agricultural industry is the production of wine grapes and wine 
vineyards in production have grown significantly over the last decade 
access to numerous recreational activities and destinations including lakes  mountains and beaches provide for a relatively stable tourist industry from many areas including the los angeles orange county basin  the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley 
the economy in the company s primary markets of san luis obispo and santa barbara counties has not been immune to the current downturn in national and state economic conditions 
weakened economic conditions have resulted in  among other things  increased unemployment  increased vacancy rates  and lower occupancy rates in the hospitality industry within the company s primary markets 
management acknowledges that as economic conditions continue to wane on state and national levels and if the level of unemployment continues to rise  conditions within our primary market may continue to be negatively impacted 
additional job losses and any prolonged decline in economic activity may further impact certain borrowers to whom the bank has extended credit and whose loans have continued to perform 
competition banking and the financial services industry in california generally  and in the company s service area specifically  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the organization of new banking entities 
in order to compete with other financial institutions in its service area  the bank relies principally upon local advertising programs  direct personal contact by officers  directors  employees and specialized services 
the bank emphasizes to customers the advantages of dealing with a locally owned and community oriented institution 
the bank also seeks to provide special services and programs for individuals in its primary service area who are employed in the agricultural  professional and business fields  such as loans for equipment  tools of trade or expansion of practices or businesses 
larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of larger marketing campaigns and possibly greater branch distribution 
they also provide services  such as trust services  international banking  discount brokerage and insurance services that the bank is not authorized or prepared to offer currently 
to compensate for this  the bank has made arrangements with correspondent banks and with others to provide such services for its customers 
for borrowers requiring loans in excess of the bank s legal lending limits  the bank offers loans on a participating basis with correspondent banks and with other independent banks and will retain the portion of such loans that are within its lending limit 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes involving frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services that have further increased competition 
there is no assurance that these technological improvements  if made  will increase the company s operational efficiency or that the company will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
effect of government policies and recent legislation banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by the company on loans extended to its customers and interest earned on securities held in its investment portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment 

table of contents the commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation  combating recession and providing liquidity by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits 
such interest rates also effect the bank s pricing on loans and what is paid on deposits 
the nature and impact on the company from future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies

in addition  the bank was required to develop a plan for reducing the number of pass graded loans designated as watch list credits to an acceptable level  and develop or revise its written lending and collection policies to provide more effective guidance and control over the bank s lending function 
the bank believes it has accomplished all of these requirements

capital standards the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization operations for both transactions resulting in asset recognition on the balance sheet  and the extension of credit facilities such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as loans 
a banking organization risk based capital ratios are determined by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
a banking organization s or holding company s capital is generally classified into one of two tiers 
tier i capital consists primarily of common equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most intangible assets  any disallowed portion of deferred tax assets and certain other limitations 
tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  cumulative preferred stock  long term preferred stock  eligible term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier ii capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of total qualifying capital to risk adjusted assets of  a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of  and a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio  of 
regulatory agencies have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at levels significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized or increase the minimum amount of capital required for capital adequacy purposes 
such a change could affect the ability of the company to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends

however  enhanced capital requirements are currently in place for the bank as illustrated in the discussion titled regulatory order and written agreement under this section supervision and regulation and note regulatory order and written agreement  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
the company s and the bank s capital ratios at december  also exceed these enhanced requirements 
prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
these actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of deposit insurance  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted

safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting  documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts

premiums for deposit insurance the bank s deposits have historically been insured by the fdic up to  per insured depositor  except certain types of retirement accounts which are insured up to  per insured depositor 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law which permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance per depositor from  to  additionally on november  the fdic issued a final rule implementing section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which provides for unlimited insurance coverage of noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
beginning december   through december   all noninterest bearing transaction accounts are fully insured  regardless of the balance of the account  at all fdic insured institutions 
on october   the board of directors of the fdic  as part of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  adopted a plan the restoration plan to ensure the deposit insurance fund dif ratio increases to a level of of estimated insured deposits by september  the adoption of the restoration plan goes into effect on january  and makes no changes to the current deposit insurance rate schedule 
the board also adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking that sets a long term dif ratio of of estimated insured deposits and provides for more predictable deposit insurance assessment rates 

table of contents on november  the fdic also adopted a final rule amending assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay their quarterly risk based assessments on december  for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and  except for those institutions where the fdic grants an exemption 
the bank was notified in the fourth quarter of by the fdic that it was exempt from prepayment of assessments for  and due in large part to the recent consent order issued to the bank  as more fully discussed above under regulatory order and written agreement  and note regulatory order and written agreement  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
however  as a result of the consent order  deposit insurance assessment costs have risen  and are expected to remain elevated during the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance if it finds that the institution is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner or has violated any rule  regulation  order or condition administered by the institution s regulatory authorities 
any such termination of deposit insurance would likely have a material adverse effect on the bank  the severity of which would depend on the amount of deposits affected by such a termination 
under federal law  deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution  including federal funds and letters of credit  in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver appointed by regulatory authorities 
such priority creditors would include the fdic 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act on july   president obama signed into law the sweeping financial regulatory reform act entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act that implements significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry  including provisions that  among other things centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency within the federal reserve board  the bureau of consumer financial protection  with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts 
smaller financial institutions  including the bank  will be subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies 
require the fdic to seek to make its capital requirements for banks countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital 
implement corporate governance revisions  including executive compensation and proxy access by stockholders 
make permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of securities investor protection corporation protection from  to  and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
the elimination of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits could materially increase our interest expense  depending on our competitors responses 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the company and the bank could require the company and the bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future

pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual privacy policies notices to current customers and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with affiliates 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 

table of contents the following loan transaction characteristics trigger coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them  unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
bank secrecy act and money laundering control act in  congress passed the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  otherwise known as the bank secrecy act the bsa  which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions 
the bsa was designed to help identify the source  volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the united states in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking  terrorism and other criminal activities 
the primary tool used to implement bsa requirements is the filing of suspicious activity reports 
today  the bsa requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions 
these programs must  at a minimum  provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance  provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance  designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training 
government actions in response to the financial crises emergency economic stabilization act in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets in recent years  the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law on october  and established the troubled asset relief program tarp 
as part of tarp  the united states department of the treasury treasury established the capital purchase program cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
in connection with eesa  there have been numerous actions by the frb  congress and the treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to further the economic and banking industry stabilization efforts under eesa 
it remains unclear at this time what further legislative and regulatory measures will be implemented under eesa affecting the company 
the company participated in the cpp and on march  issued and sold  shares of its series a preferred stock to treasury and issued a warrant for the purchase of  shares  in exchange for million 
for further details on the company s participation in the cpp  please see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements filed with this form k 
because of the company s participation in the cpp  it is subject to certain limitations on executive compensation and the payment of dividends 
the company believes it is compliant with all such limitations 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
arra is intended to provide tax breaks for individuals and businesses  direct aid to distressed states and individuals and provide infrastructure spending 
in addition  arra imposes new executive compensation and expenditure limits on all previous and future tarp recipients and expands the class of employees to whom the limits and restrictions apply 
arra also provides the opportunity for additional repayment flexibility for existing tarp recipients 
among other things  arra prohibits the payment of bonuses  other incentive compensation and severance to certain highly paid employees except in the form of restricted stock subject to specified limitations and conditions and requires each tarp recipient to comply with certain other executive compensation related requirements 
these provisions modify the executive compensation provisions that were included in eesa and  in most instances  apply retroactively for so long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided to the recipient under tarp remains outstanding 

table of contents in addition  arra directs the treasury to review previously paid bonuses  retention awards and other compensation paid to the senior executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees of each tarp recipient to determine whether any such payments were excessive  inconsistent with the purposes of arra or the tarp  or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
if the treasury determines that any such payments have been made by a tarp recipient  the treasury will seek to negotiate with the tarp recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the us government not the tarp recipient with respect to any such compensation or bonuses 
arra also permits the treasury  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency  to allow a tarp recipient to repay any assistance previously provided to such tarp recipient under the tarp  without regard to whether the tarp recipient has replaced such funds from any source  and without regard to any waiting period 
any tarp recipient that repays its tarp assistance pursuant to this provision would no longer be subject to the executive compensation provisions under arra 
future legislation and regulatory initiatives various other legislative and regulatory initiatives  including proposals to overhaul the banking regulatory system are from time to time introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as regulatory agencies 
currently  the congress is actively considering significant changes in the manner of regulating financial institutions including combining one or more of the frb  fdic  comptroller of the currency and the office of thrift supervision and creating a new consumer protection agency for financial products 
the current legislation being considered and other future legislation regarding financial institutions may change banking statutes  the operating environment of the company and the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted 
if enacted  the effect of implementing regulations could impact positively or negatively  the financial condition or results of operations of the company and or the bank 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is unpredictable at this time 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon its financial condition or operations

risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents risks associated with our business our banking subsidiary is operating under a consent order with the fdic and dfi and the company is operating under a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco to address  among other things  lending  credit and capital related issues 
in light of the current challenging operating environment  along with our elevated level of non performing assets  delinquencies and adversely classified assets  we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and additional regulatory restrictions and have become subject to certain enforcement actions under a consent order issued by the fdic and dfi to the bank on march  and written agreement with the federal reserve board entered into on march  these enforcement actions followed the fdic s regularly scheduled examination of our banking subsidiary during the fourth quarter of and are based on discussions the bank had following the examination 
such enforcement actions place limitations on our business and may adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans 
these enforcement actions require  among other things  the bank to take certain steps to strengthen its balance sheet  such as reducing the level of classified assets  increasing capital levels and addressing other criticisms of the examination 
these enforcement actions are more fully discussed in supervision and regulation regulatory order and written agreement and note regulatory order and written agreement  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
if the company fails to comply with these enforcement actions  it may become subject to further regulatory enforcement actions up to and including the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank 
even though the bank remains well capitalized  the regulatory agencies have the authority to restrict our operations to those consistent with adequately capitalized institutions 
for example  the regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions that place limitations on our lending activities 
the regulatory agencies also have the power to limit the rates paid by the bank to attract retail deposits in its local markets 
our level of classified assets expose us to increased lending risk 
further  if our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio  our earnings may decline if the level of loans the bank currently categorizes as substandard and doubtful do not perform according to the terms and or the underlying collateral for such loans is insufficient to cover the bank s recorded investment  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb potential losses 
this could result in additional loan losses which may further adversely impact our operating results 
further  our level of classified assets will take time to resolve 
while we believe that we are making progress in identifying and resolving classified assets  no assurance can be given that we will continue to make progress  particularly if the local economies in which we operate suffer further deterioration 
we believe that the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable  estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of such borrowers making payments  as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  significant factors we consider include loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  trends and absolute levels of classified loans  trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans  trends in risk ratings  trends in industry charge offs by particular segments and changes in existing general economic and business conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
our regulators  as an integral part of their regular examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs 
any additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are highly dependent on real estate and any further downturn in the real estate market may hurt our business a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
a decline in current economic conditions  a decline in the local housing market or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans  the value of real estate owned by us  as well as our financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of our common stock 
acts of nature  including earthquakes  floods and fires  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans may also negatively impact our financial condition 
we have concentration in higher risk commercial real estate loans we have high concentration in commercial real estate cre loans 
cre loans  as defined by final guidance issued by bank regulators  are defined as construction  land development  other land loans  loans secured by multi family or more units residential properties and loans secured by non farm non residential properties 
following this definition  approximately of our lending portfolio can be classified as cre lending as of december  cre loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than certain other types of lending due  among other things  to the generally large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt 
cash flow may be significantly affected by general economic conditions which may result in non performance by certain borrowers 
additionally  federal banking regulators recently issued final guidance regarding commercial real estate lending 
this guidance suggests that institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
institutions that have experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate lending or are approaching or exceed certain supervisory criteria that measure an institution s commercial real estate portfolio against its capital levels  may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny because of our commercial real estate portfolio and  as a result  the bank must develop or revise  adopt  and implement a plan to systematically reduce the amount of loans within this category as outlined in the consent order issued to the bank on march  liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in general 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations  but our consent order and written agreement prohibit the payment of such dividends without prior regulatory approval which may impair our ability to fulfill our obligations as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities  our preferred stock and other obligations  including any cash dividends 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
as outlined in the consent order and written agreement  previously mentioned  the bank cannot pay any cash dividends or other payments to the holding company without prior written consent of the regulatory authorities 
additionally  the company cannot declare or pay any dividends including those on outstanding preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program or make any distributions of principal  interest or other sums on its trust preferred securities without prior written approval of the federal reserve 
to date  we have deferred four payments on our tarp preferred stock 
if we defer six dividend payments  the us treasury will have the right to appoint two directors to our board 

table of contents the recent recession and changes in domestic and foreign financial markets have adversely affected our industry and may have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition the recent recession has resulted in significant business failures and job losses 
further  dramatic declines in the housing market with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant losses to many financial institutions 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and volatility in the financial markets may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
these challenging conditions may not improve in the near future and we may face the following risks as a result increased regulation of our industry  compliance with which may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected 
higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economic downturn on our future results of operations or market price of our stock the national economy and the financial services sector in particular remain challenged with weakness in the broader economy despite high levels of government stimulus 
we cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted the markets we serve 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline 
recently enacted legislation and other measures undertaken by the us treasury  the frb and other governmental agencies over the last two years may not result in improved economic conditions on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law  which  among other measures  authorized the treasury secretary to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp 
eesa gives broad authority to treasury to purchase  manage  modify  sell and insure the troubled mortgage related assets that triggered the current economic crisis as well as other troubled assets 
eesa includes additional provisions directed at bolstering the economy  including authority for the frb to pay interest on depository institution balances  and mortgage loss mitigation and homeowner protection 
pursuant to the tarp  the treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
under the tarp  the treasury has created a capital purchase program  pursuant to which it is providing access to capital to financial institutions through a standardized program to acquire preferred stock accompanied by warrants from eligible financial institutions that will serve as tier capital 
eesa followed  and has been followed by  numerous actions by the frb  congress  treasury and others to address the liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime meltdown that commenced in these measures include homeowner relief that encourage loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  and other emergency actions designed to stabilize the financial sector and mitigate economic pressures 

table of contents on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill was signed into law 
the stimulus bill included a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
if  as a result of the above actions taken  economic conditions do not improve  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted beyond what has been realized 
fdic deposit insurance assessments may increase substantially which would adversely affect our net earnings fdic deposit insurance premiums for the year ended december  was million 
the company currently expects the level of deposit insurance premiums to remain elevated for the foreseeable future which will impact future operating results 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments  financial performance and capital we maintain an investment portfolio that includes  but is not limited to  mortgage backed securities 
the market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the last two years 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities or the mortgages underlying the securities  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment 
we may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to charge against earnings the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charges occur 
for a more detailed discussion of investments the company holds  including other than temporary impairment recognized during  please see note investments  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance and financial condition our earnings and cash flows are highly dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest income including net interest spread and margin and overall earnings are impacted by changes in interest rates and monetary policy 
changes in interest rates and monetary policy can impact the demand for new loans  the credit profile of our borrowers  the yields earned on loans and securities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we would expect our interest rate spread the difference in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the yields earned on interest earning assets as well as net interest income to increase if interest rates rise and  conversely  to decline if interest rates fall 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates such as a sudden and substantial increase in prime and overnight fed funds rates as well as increasing competition may require the bank to increase rates on deposits at a faster pace than the increase in the rate it earns on interest earning assets 
the impact of any sudden and substantial move in interest rates and or increased competition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as the bank s net interest income including the net interest spread and margin may be negatively impacted 
additionally  a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to prepay existing higher rate  fixed rate loans by refinancing to lower interest rates loan 
under those circumstances  we may not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans 
failure to successfully execute our strategy may adversely affect our performance our financial performance and profitability depends on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 

table of contents factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long term financial performance goals include those stated elsewhere in this section  as well as inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee compensation costs  regulatory compliance  healthcare cost  limitations imposed on us in the consent order and or written agreement  inability to increase non interest income and continuing ability to expand  through de novo branching or identifying acquisition targets at attractive valuation levels 
we face strong competition from financial service and other companies that offer banking service which may hurt our business the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition in attracting and retaining core business relationships 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share  decrease loan demand  cause the prices we charge for our services to fall  result in a decline in the rates we charge on loans and or cause higher rates to be paid on deposits 
therefore  our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature and level of competition 
additionally  technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them without offering very high compensation 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
because of our participation in the troubled asset relief program tarp  we are subject to several restrictions  including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance apply to us for the period during which the us treasury holds an equity position in us 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include  among other things  ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required claw back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes  executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation may increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill  more commonly known as the economic stimulus recovery package  further compensation restrictions  including significant limitations on incentive compensation  have been imposed on our senior executive officers and most highly compensated employees 
such restrictions and any future restrictions on executive compensation  which may be adopted  could adversely affect our ability to hire and retain senior executive officers 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks we are subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
we maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents information systems we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  the central coast of california is subject to earthquakes and fires 
operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities 
while we have not experienced such an occurrence to date  other severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with our industry we are subject to government regulation that may limit or restrict our activities which may adversely impact our operations the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or repeal of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our business 
we anticipate that continued compliance with various regulatory provisions will impact future operating expenses 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects economic conditions which may impact the bank 
new legislative and regulatory proposals may affect our operations and growth proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and financial institutions and federal insurance premiums paid by banks and financial institutions and companies that control such institutions are frequently raised in the us congress  state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities 
the likelihood of any major changes in the future and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine 
similarly  proposals to change the accounting treatment applicable to banks and other depository institutions are frequently raised by the sec  the federal banking agencies  the irs and other appropriate authorities 

table of contents the likelihood and impact of any additional future changes in law or regulation and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine at this time 
risks associated with our stock our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp may pose certain risks to holders of our common stock under the terms of the cpp  the company sold to the us treasury million in preferred stock and a warrant to purchase approximately million of the company s common stock 
although the company believes that its participation in the cpp is in the best interests of our shareholders in that it enhances company and bank capital and provides additional funds for future growth  it may pose certain risks to the holders of our common stock such as the following under the terms outlined by the us treasury for participants in the cpp  the company issued a warrant to the u 
s treasury to purchase shares of its common stock 
the issuance of this warrant may be dilutive to current common stockholders in that it reduces earnings per common share 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the us treasury has the right to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which would result in an approximate ownership interest 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction and therefore has the ability to become a shareholder of the company and possess voting power 
the preferred equity issued to the us treasury is non voting  however  the terms of the cpp stipulate that the us treasury may vote their senior equity in matters deemed by the us treasury to have an impact on their holdings 
the purchase agreement between the company and the u 
s treasury provides that before the earlier of march  and the date on which all of the shares of the preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without consent of the us treasury  a increase the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share  the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the preferred stock 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant issued to the us treasury  may have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
although the company does not foresee any material changes to the terms associated with its participation in the cpp  the us government  as a sovereign body  may at any time change the terms of our participation in the cpp and or significantly influence company policy 
for more information about the company s participation in the cpp  see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k 
our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share and may be dilutive to common stockholders accrued dividends and the accretion on our outstanding preferred stock reduce net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
additionally  our series c preferred stock may be dilutive to common stockholders to the extent the company is profitable and must consider the dilutive nature of these securities in its calculation of earnings per common share

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december   and the analysis should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
financial overview for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of approximately million or per common share 
this compares to a net loss of million or per common share for and net income of million or per common share for the year was one of the most challenging in the company s history 
continued economic weakness and a challenging credit environment resulted in additional credit losses which required an elevated level of loan loss provisioning 
provisions for loan losses totaled million for  an increase of million from that reported for although the company recorded a higher annual level of loan loss provision expense in than it did in prior year  this elevated provisioning enabled the company to significantly increase its allowance for loan and lease losses alll by million and contributed to a basis point increase in alll as a percentage of total gross loans from at prior year end to as of december  write downs on foreclosed assets also contributed to the year over year decline in operating results  which were largely due to continued depressed values of certain types of commercial  construction and land properties 
write downs on foreclosed assets totaled million for  an increase of million from that reported in further contributing to the net loss for was a million valuation allowance  and corresponding charge to income tax expense  that the company recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
although operating results for were negatively impacted by the charges noted above  the company made good progress in improving core earnings as evidenced by a increase in total revenues net interest income plus non interest income that grew to million  million higher than reported for net interest income increased to million in  which was million or higher than that reported for while net interest margin was in  as compared to the reported for the increase in net interest income was due to a million increase in average earning assets  primarily investment securities  in comparison to prior year s average earning asset balances 
the increase in earning assets was driven by growth in our core deposit balances and the million capital raise in first quarter  both of which drove higher investment security balances as the loan portfolio declined 
partly offsetting the increase to net interest income was a basis point reduction in net interest margin caused by a million reduction in outstanding loans and reversal of million of interest accrued on non performing loans 
non interest revenues in grew to million reflecting a million or increase over this increase was driven by higher mortgage origination fees which grew million or to million in largely due to higher mortgage refinance volumes 
the company also benefited from the extinguishment of million in higher cost junior subordinated debentures during as the repurchase of trust preferred securities issued by heritage oaks capital trust iii  resulted in a million pre tax gain 
non interest expenses totaled million for  representing an increase of million compared to the year over year increase was driven by a million increase in write downs on foreclosed assets  a million increase in compensation costs and a million increase in deposit insurance expense 
increases in compensation costs in can be attributed to additional senior management hires and build out of the special assets department to work through problem loans 
was also impacted by a one time charge of million related to accrued compensation balances 
the company s efficiency ratio was in as compared to reported for management is implementing additional cost reduction measures in an effort to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency in 
table of contents as noted previously  gross loan balances declined million or in to million  which resulted from weakened new loan demand  normal portfolio payoffs that exceeded new loan originations and higher levels of charged off loans 
in fourth quarter  the company increased gross loans outstanding million over third quarter 
the company continued to grow deposit balances in total deposits were million at december   million or higher than that reported at december  excluding the pay down of brokered deposits in  customer deposits increased million 
the majority of this growth occurred within the lower cost  core non interest bearing demand deposits  regular savings and money market accounts 
the company continued to work through its problem loans in by reducing million of its exposure to land  development and construction loans which have been the most problematic portions of the loan portfolio and substantially increased its allowance for loan losses 
during the company placed million in loan balances on non accrual status  increased the level of scrutiny placed on certain types of credit and increased loan workout and collection activities 
additions to non accruing balances were offset by pay downs on such credits of million  charge offs of million  and transfer of loans back to accruing status of million 
the company also transferred million in non performing balances to foreclosed collateral during non performing assets totaled million at december   million above that reported at december  the company s efforts to reduce its exposure to loan losses resulted in a million increase to the allowance for loan losses which totaled million at december  at year end  the allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans  as compared to of total gross loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december   substantially improved from the reported for december  despite the various headwinds the company faced in  it was able to increase capital by completing a private equity placement during march  in which the company successfully raised million of additional capital 
this additional capital significantly strengthened the company s balance sheet  allowing it to continue to work through problem assets  accelerate resolution of problem loans  increase earning assets and achieve compliance with the capital ratio requirements of the consent order 
the company s total risk based capital  tier i risk based capital and tier leverage ratios were   and respectively as of december   as compared to the  and reported at december  in the company added to its senior management talent and increased staffing in the special assets department

results of operations the company reported net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  the company reported net income of million 
fully diluted net losses per common share were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company reported fully diluted net income per common share of for the year ended december  as previously discussed  earnings were negatively impacted on a year over year basis due in large part to the substantial increase in provisions for loan losses required because of continued weakness in the loan portfolio 
additionally  the valuation allowance expense for deferred tax assets  write downs on the values of foreclosed assets  higher compensation cost associated with the expansion of the management team and special assets department and weaker new loan demand all contributed to a year over year decline in operating results 
net interest income and margin net interest income  the primary component of the net earnings of a financial institution  refers to the difference between the interest paid on deposits and borrowings  and the interest earned on loans and investments 
the net interest margin is the amount of net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
factors considered in the analysis of net interest income are the composition and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amount of non interest bearing liabilities  non accruing loans  and changes in market interest rates 

table of contents the table below sets forth average balance sheet information  interest income and expense  average yields and rates and net interest income and margin for the years ended december   and the average balance of non accruing loans has been included in loan totals for the year ended  for the year ended  for the year ended  december  december  december  yield income yield income yield income dollar amounts in thousands balance rate expense balance rate expense balance rate expense interest earning assets investments with other banks interest bearing due from federal funds sold investment securities taxable investment securities non taxable loans total interest earning assets allowance for loan losses other assets total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand savings money market time deposits total interest bearing deposits federal funds purchased securities sold under agreement to repurchase federal home loan bank borrowing federal reserve bank borrowing junior subordinated debentures other secured borrowing total borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing demand total funding other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income net interest margin non accruing loans have been included in total loans

loan fees of and have been included in the interest income computation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   average interest earning assets were approximately million higher than that reported for the year ended december  higher average balances of investment securities stemming from the million in net proceeds the company received from its march private placement  coupled with an increase in average core deposit balances led to the year over year increase in average interest earning assets 
although the increase in investment balances ultimately contributed to a year over year increase in interest income  the lower yields earned on these investments  due in large part to the current lower interest rate environment  contributed to a decline in earning asset yields in anemic loan demand through  made it difficult for the company to originate and fund new  high quality credits 
this  along with normal portfolio attrition and pay downs on loans outpaced new loan originations  leading to loan portfolio contraction for most of  a decline in interest and fees earned on loans and ultimately a decrease in the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
additionally  the company transferred million in loans to non accrual status during  which resulted in interest reversals of million  contributing to the year over year decline in interest and fees earned on loans 
furthermore  average impaired loan balances in were approximately million higher than that reported for  which placed additional pressure on loan portfolio yields in total forgone interest on impaired loans including interest reversed when a loan is initially placed on non accrual and all interest income lost prospectively totaled approximately million for  impacting the yield on earning assets by approximately basis points 
for forgone interest totaled million and impacted the yield on earning assets by basis points 
a lower overall yield on the loan portfolio  coupled with an increase in lower yielding investment securities resulted in lower earning asset yields which lead to a year over year decline in the net interest margin

table of contents average interest bearing liabilities increased million in from the million reported at december  the year over year increase can be attributed to higher average balances of core interest bearing deposits  including increases in money market and time deposit accounts  which resulted from promotional activities and added focus on attracting and retaining core relationships 
the yield on interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   representing a decline of basis points 
in an effort to augment the decline in earning asset yields and reduce pressure on the net interest margin  the company lowered offering rates significantly during the latter half of as a result  the company significantly reduced the cost of money market and time deposits during additionally  the company restructured and paid down higher cost fhlb borrowings during  contributing to the decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
further  in june the company eliminated million in junior subordinated debentures from the balance sheet  associated with the repurchase of trust preferred securities issued by heritage oaks capital trust iii 
these borrowings previously accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled monthly 
the results of these models indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon from a and upward and downward rate movement are within the company s policy guidelines for such changes

provision for income taxes the amount of the tax provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income  adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
such permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income and earnings on bank owned life insurance 
for the years ended december  and the company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  the company recorded provisions for income taxes of million 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
during the company established a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
the establishment of this valuation allowance resulted in a reduction in the income tax benefit the company recorded in  leading to a year over year increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were impacted significantly by the substantial provisions the bank made to the allowance for loan losses during those years  significantly reducing pre tax income 
as a result  income from permanent items such as interest on municipal securities and earnings on holdings of bank owned life insurance had a greater impact on the income tax provision than in prior periods 
see also note income taxes  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k for a more detailed discussion concerning the valuation allowance the company established for a portion of its deferred tax assets 
provision for loan losses an allowance for loan losses was established to provide for those loans that may not be repaid in their entirety for a variety of reasons 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable incurred losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as of the date of the balance sheet  which includes  among other things  an analysis of past loan loss experience and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s best estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable estimable losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectability of loans in the portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  management s findings from internal loan reviews  findings from an independent semi annual loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes monthly evaluations as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and makes adjustments to the related provision for loan losses accordingly 
the company s provision for loan losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and provisions for loan losses in were million higher than that reported for  which is reflective of additional credit losses the company incurred during as well as continued weakness in economic conditions 

table of contents looking forward into  management anticipates continued weakness in economic conditions on national  state and local levels yet slightly improved in comparison to continued economic pressures may negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the bank has extended credit and as a result the bank may be required to make further additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses during that said  management has and will continue to take a proactive stance with respect to managing credit quality and minimizing the overall negative effects of problem credit 
financial condition during the company focused heavily on the identification and resolution of problem assets in an effort to position the company for improved asset quality and growth in future periods 
the focus placed on improving asset quality in conjunction with a decline in new loan demand  led to a million decrease in gross loan balances during the company also placed million of loan balances on non accrual  transferred million to foreclosed collateral  and charged off million in loan balances during this contributed to an increase in the allowance for loan losses of million  bringing the balance of the allowance to million  representing of total gross loans at december  deposits increased million to million during the majority of the growth can be attributed to an increase in core deposit balances  resulting from promotional efforts and initiatives focused on gathering and retaining core relationships 
the increase in low cost  core deposits allowed the company to pay down million in higher cost fhlb borrowing 
shareholders equity increased million to million during the increase resulted from the successful completion of a private placement in in which the company raised million in total gross proceeds 
this additional capital significantly strengthened the company s balance sheet  allowing management to continue to focus on improving asset quality and further building the core franchise 
pay downs in the loan portfolio  coupled with the proceeds the company received from its march private placement  led to an increase in the balance of the investments portfolio 
investment securities increased million to million during in the absence of significant new loan demand  the company made selective investments primarily in agency backed mortgage securities and municipal bonds 
these investments helped to mitigate net interest margin compression by actively managing the level of lower yielding  excess  overnight liquidity

all loans the bank originates that are considered construction or for acquisition and development are monitored by a construction budget 
draw requests are aligned with monthly projections and reviewed against documents submitted by the borrower 
in addition a third party construction inspector conducts regular on site visits to the project site and provides a written report comparing the loan balance to work completed  budget accuracy  as well as the adequacy of funds left to disburse against the remaining costs to complete the project

various factors are considered by the bank when determining the continued use of an interest reserve with focus placed on certain red flags during the life cycle of acquisition and development projects acquisition  development  and construction 
such red flags are designed to alert the bank to potential significant delays or execution risk for the overall project  which would indicate that continued use of an interest reserve is not appropriate  and include such things as the borrower s delay  neglect  or failure to perform appropriate engineering and environmental studies  prepare site plans  submit formal applications to relevant planning and zoning authorities  subdivide  level  or grade the site  build out required site improvements  and properly manage the construction phase of the project

table of contents summary of market condition the current recessive economic conditions resulted in a decline in loan demand which largely contributed to contraction in the loan portfolio during economic pressures have also resulted in an overall decline in business activity which has impacted some borrowers to whom the company has extended credit 
the company realizes that a continued decline in the national  state and local economies may further impact such borrowers  as well as the values of real estate within our market footprint used to secure certain loans 
as such  management continues to closely monitor the credits within the company s commercial and commercial real estate segments of the loan portfolio for additional signs of deterioration 
the bank employs stringent lending standards and remains very selective with regard to loan originations including commercial real estate  real estate construction  land and commercial loans that it chooses to originate in an effort to effectively manage risk in this difficult credit environment 
the company has devoted considerable resources to monitoring credit in order to take appropriate steps when and if necessary to mitigate any material adverse impacts on the company 
credit quality the company s primary business is the extension of credit to individuals and businesses and safekeeping of customers deposits 
the company s policies concerning the extension of credit require risk analyses including an extensive evaluation of the purpose for the loan request and the borrower s ability and willingness to repay the bank as agreed 
the company also considers other factors when evaluating whether or not to extend new credit to a potential borrower 
these factors include the current level of diversification in the loan portfolio and the impact that funding a new loan will have on that diversification  legal lending limit constraints  current concentrations of credit and any regulatory limitations concerning the extension of certain types of credit 
the credit quality of the loan portfolio is impacted by numerous factors including the economic environment in the markets the company operates in which can have a direct impact on the value of real estate securing collateral dependent loans 
weak economic conditions have also impacted certain borrowers the company has extended credit to  making it difficult for those borrowers to continue to make timely repayment on their loans 
an inability of certain borrowers to continue to perform under the original terms of their respective loan agreements in conjunction with declines in real estate collateral values may result in increases in provisions for loan losses that have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
see also note loans  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k  for a more detailed discussion concerning credit quality  including the company s related policy 
allowance for loan and lease losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable losses as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is comprised of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation and subjectively determined allocation 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and decreased by loan charge offs  net of recovered balances 
please see note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements  filed on this form k for a detailed discussion concerning the company s methodology for determining an adequate allowance 
please also see note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for loan losses of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  loan charge offs  and credit risk management 
the determination of the amount of the allowance and any corresponding increase or decrease in the level of provisions for loan losses is based on management s best estimate of the current credit quality of the loan portfolio and any probable inherent losses as of the balance sheet date 
the nature of the process in which management determines the appropriate level of the allowance involves the exercise of considerable judgment 
while management utilizes its best judgment and all available information in determining the adequacy of the allowance  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including but not limited to  the performance of the loan portfolio  changes in current and future economic conditions and the view of regulatory agencies regarding the level of classified assets 
continued weakness in economic conditions and any other factor that may adversely affect credit quality result in higher levels of past due and non accruing loans  defaults and additional loan charge offs which may require additional provisions for loan losses in future periods and increased allowance for loan losses 

table of contents for reporting purposes  the company allocates the allowance for loan losses across product types within the loan portfolio 
however  substantially all of the allowance is available to absorb all credit losses without restriction  unless specific reserves have been established

at december  the level of classified loans totaled million which was up slightly from the million reported at december  a continuation of the elevated level of classified loans  coupled with an increase in estimated loss factors applied to such balances  contributed significantly to the year over year increase in the allowance for loan losses 
specifically  the level of classified commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate loans increased million to million at december  given these segments of the loan portfolio accounted for million or of total net charge offs in  the company increased loss factors for these areas of the portfolio 
at december  commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate reserves account for million or of the total allowance for loan losses 
this compares to the million or of total reserves allocated to the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments at december  contributing further to the year over year increase in the allowance for loan losses was increase in the dollar amount of reserves allocated to the construction and land segments 
although the level of classified construction and land balances declined million to million at december   the company significantly increased loss factors for such credits given our past loss experience for such credits has been more severe on a relative basis compared to other segments of the loan portfolio 

table of contents as mentioned  sustained weakness in general economic conditions during also contributed to the year over year increase in the level of the allowance for loan losses 
weakened economic conditions in the company s market area has resulted in increased job losses  contributing to a decline in economic activity and a protracted decline in the value of real estate used as collateral 
these pressures have increased the potential for losses as the ability for certain borrowers to service debt has become strained and collateral values remained depressed 
as a result  the company further increased the allowance for commercial and industrial  commercial real estate  and construction land loans to reflect the impact that such pressures could have on borrowers within those segments 
the allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans at december  as compared to reported at december  as of december  management believes the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to cover current estimable losses in the company s loan portfolio

total deposit balances were million at december   an increase of million from that reported at december  increased deposit balances can be attributed to higher balances of non interest bearing demand  money market  savings  and time deposits 
increases within these categories were partially offset by a decline in interest bearing checking accounts as the company allowed certain higher cost  more rate sensitive balances to run off 
the company continued its focus on gathering and retaining core relationships during which has helped to reduce the overall cost of funding 
as of december  the bank had no brokered deposits 
core deposits demand  savings  money market and time certificates less than  represented million or of total deposits at december  compared to million or of total deposits at december  management s continued focus on lower cost deposit gathering in helped to reduce overall cost of funds by basis points to from reported for borrowed funds the bank has a variety of sources from which it may obtain secondary funding 
these sources include  among others  the federal home loan bank fhlb  the federal reserve bank frb and credit lines established with correspondent banks 
at december   fhlb borrowings were million or million lower than that reported at december  the year over year decline in fhlb borrowing can be attributed to an increase in deposit balances during and the capital raise in march  both of which provided the company less need for wholesale funding 
at december   the bank s remaining capacity to borrow from the fhlb was million while the unused credit line at the frb was million 
additionally  in september  the bank issued a letter of credit in the amount of million which has since been reduced to million to a customer to guarantee their performance to other parties

regulatory capital the company and its bank subsidiary seek to maintain strong levels of capital above the well capitalized thresholds as determined by regulatory agencies by an amount commensurate with our risk profile 
the company s potential sources of capital include retained earnings and the issuance of equity 
although the company and bank rely primarily on earnings from its operations to generate capital  the absence of earnings in the last two years have required the company to obtain additional capital through the issuance of preferred and common equity 

table of contents as previously mentioned  the company completed a private placement during leading to the issuance of  shares of its common stock and  shares of series c preferred stock for total net proceeds of million

summarized below are the company s and the bank s capital ratios at december  and regulatory standard december  december  adequately well heritage oaks heritage oaks ratio capitalized capitalized bancorp bank bancorp bank leverage ratio tier i capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets by the total assets 
in the tier risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total for risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio  again  uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the loan loss reserve  long term capital debt  certain types of preferred equity and other instruments 
the bank s capital ratios were also in compliance with capital requirements of a leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of as stipulated by the consent order 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset liquidity is primarily derived from loan payments and the maturity of other earning assets 
liquidity from liabilities is obtained primarily from the receipt of new deposits 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the on and off balance sheet commitments to meet the cash needs of customers while maintaining sufficient liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations in both stable and adverse conditions 
alco meets regularly to assess projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual customer funding needs 
deposits generated from the bank s customers serve as the primary source of liquidity 
the bank has credit arrangements with correspondent banks that serve as a secondary liquidity source 
at december   these credit lines totaled million 
while one of these two lines in the amount of million is an unsecured line of credit  the bank must provide collateral in order to borrow against the other line 
at december   the bank had no borrowings against these lines 
as previously mentioned the bank is a member of the fhlb and has collateralized borrowing capacities remaining of million at december  additionally  the bank also has a borrowing facility with the federal reserve 
the amount of available credit is determined by the collateral provided by the bank 
as of december  the borrowing availability related to this facility was million 
the bank also manages liquidity by maintaining an investment portfolio of readily marketable and liquid securities 
most of these investments include mortgage backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions municipal bonds that provide a steady stream of cash flows 
as of december   the company believes investments in the portfolio can be liquidated at their current fair values in the event they are needed to provide liquidity 
the ratio of liquid assets not pledged for collateral and other purposes to deposits and other liabilities was improved to at december  compared to at december  
table of contents the ratio of gross loans to deposits ltd  another key liquidity ratio  was improved to at december  compared to at december  critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
accounting policies management considers to be significant are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief listing of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments investment securities loans and interest on loans other real estate owned loans held for sale allowance for loan losses loan charge offs appraisals for collateral dependent loans goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes supplemental employee compensation benefits agreements off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business  the company may enter into off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the subsidiary bank level 
thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the banking subsidiary level except for million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trusts 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the banking subsidiary level 
the subsidiary bank s real estate loan portfolio which is concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties of california are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the fundamental objective behind the management of the company s assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
the asset liability committee of the board of directors establishes the limits for interest rate risk the bank s management must work within 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results 
management believes that it can continue to manage the effect of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the bank s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset and liability separately in measuring the bank s interest sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the bank s balance sheet is liability sensitive 
the company generally expects contraction in its net interest income if rates rise and expects  conversely  increases in net interest income if rates fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the bank s alco policies 
management will continue to perform this analysis each quarter to further validate the expected results against actual data 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled monthly 
the results of this movement indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a and parallel shift in interest rates are within the company s policy guidelines for such changes 
rate shock scenarios dollar amounts in thousands bp bp base bp bp net interest income nii change from base change from base it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of the loans the bank can expect to see come off their floors if the prime rate were to increase by the amounts presented as of december  move in prime rate bps dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor the company also attempts to quantify the impact of interest rate changes on borrowers ability to pay on loans and the impact of similar rate changes on the value of collateral held against loans 
to this end  the company  from time to time  will sample loans and analyze them under a rate shock scenario to specifically assess the impact of the rate shock on financial ratios such as interest rate coverage and loan to value 
the results of the analysis have generally revealed that in the case of such a rate shock  a high percentage of loans tested would continue to express ratios within current underwriting guidelines 
the results of these analyses are considered acceptable by management
