item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this form k for additional information on acquisitions completed during fiscal  and major products one of avnet s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes 
ibm products accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated sales during fiscal  and  respectively  and was the only supplier from which sales of its products exceeded of consolidated sales 
listed in the table below are the major product categories and the company s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years years ended july  july  june  millions semiconductors computer products connectors passives  electromechanical and other competition markets avnet is one of the world s largest industrial distributors  based on sales  of electronic components and computer products and services 
the company has more than locations worldwide as well as a limited number of instances where avnet owned product is stored in customer facilities 
some of these locations contain sales  warehousing and administrative functions for multiple sales and marketing units 
the electronic components and computer products industries continue to be extremely competitive and are subject to rapid technological advances 
the company s major competitors include arrow electronics  inc  future electronics and world peace group 
there are also certain smaller  specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets  products or particular sectors 
as a result of these factors  avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of goods and services 
another key competitive factor in the electronic component and computer product distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount of inventory to meet customers rapid delivery requirements 
however  to minimize its exposure related to valuation of inventory on hand  the majority of the company s products are purchased pursuant to non exclusive distributor agreements 
these agreements typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion and are generally cancelable upon to days notice 
in most cases  these agreements provide for inventory return privileges upon cancellation 
in addition  the company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value added services which entail the performance of services and or processes tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs such as point of use replenishment  testing  assembly  supply chain management and materials management 
another competitive advantage is the size of the supplier base 
because of the number of avnet s suppliers  many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from avnet  rather than purchasing from several different vendors 
seasonality historically  avnet s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality  with the exception of a relatively minor impact on consolidated results from the growth in revenues in the technology solutions business during the december quarter primarily driven by the fiscal year end of a key supplier

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements and risk factors this report contains forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of avnet 
these statements are generally identified by words like believes  expects  anticipates  should  will  may  estimates or similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 

table of contents except as required by law  avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements include the following economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
the company s revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions  the demand for its products and services and the financial condition of its customers 
economic weakness and uncertainty have in the past resulted  and may result in the future  in decreased revenues and gross profit margins 
economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the company to forecast with a great deal of confidence the overall supply and demand throughout the it supply chain 
while the company s operating results over the past four quarters would suggest that the business has experienced a significant recovery  there can be no assurance that the recovery to date will continue at the current pace or at all  nor can there be any assurance that such economic volatility experienced recently will not reoccur or continue 
the electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the company fails to compete effectively  its revenues  gross profit margins and prospects may decline 
the market for the company s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances 
not only does the company compete with other global distributors  it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the company s own suppliers 
the company s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects 
furthermore  the company s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and  thus  overall profitability 
the size of the company s competitors vary across market sectors  as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business 
therefore  some of the competitors may have greater financial  personnel  capacity and other resources or a more extensive customer base than the company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas 
an industry down cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect the company s operating results as a large portion of revenues comes from sales of semiconductors  which is a highly cyclical industry 
the semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand  often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity  and is generally considered to be highly cyclical 
during each of the last three fiscal years  sales of semiconductors represented over of the company s consolidated sales  and the company s revenues  particularly those of em  closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market 
future downturns in the technology industry  particularly in the semiconductor sector  could negatively affect the company s operating results and negatively impact the company s ability to maintain its current profitability levels 
failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the company s sales 
one of the company s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the company distributes 
however  sales of products and services from one of the company s suppliers  ibm  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated sales in fiscal year management expects ibm products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the company s consolidated sales in fiscal year the company s contracts with its suppliers  including those with ibm  vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice 
to the extent ibm or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the company in the future  because of a product shortage  an unwillingness to do business with avnet or otherwise  the company s business and relationships with its customers could be materially and adversely affected because its customers depend on the company s distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry s leading suppliers 
in addition  to the extent that any of the company s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including  without limitation  the terms regarding price protection  rights of return  rebates or other terms that protect the company s gross margins  it could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents declines in the value of the company s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the company s customers could materially and adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced products and evolving industry standards  which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory 
regardless of the general economic environment  it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and  as a result of the price declines  there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value 
although it is the policy of many of the company s suppliers to offer distributors like avnet certain protections from the loss in value of inventory such as price protection and limited rights of return  the company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value  or that the vendors will choose to  or be able to  honor such agreements  some of which are not documented and  therefore  subject to the discretion of the vendor 
in addition  the company s sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and the company generally does not have long term supply arrangements with its customers 
generally  the company s customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment with minimal penalties 
the company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments  declines in the value of the company s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
substantial defaults by the company s customers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
a significant portion of the company s working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers 
if customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services  or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 
an economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable  which could result in longer payment cycles  increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations 
a significant deterioration in the company s ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program see financing transactions appearing in item of this report 
the company s non us locations represent a significant and growing portion of its revenue  and consequently  the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
during fiscal year  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales came from its operations outside the united states 
as a result of the company s foreign sales and locations  in particular those in emerging and developing economies  the company s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations  including  but not limited to  the following potential restrictions on the company s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the company s reported results of operations  import and export duties and value added taxes  compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations  business licensing requirements and anti corruption laws  the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines  criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges  changing tax laws and regulations  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  political instability  terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest  fluctuations in freight costs  limitations on shipping and receiving capacity  and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure  differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues  and the risk of non compliance with local laws 

table of contents the potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti corruption laws  particularly anti bribery  data privacy laws and environmental laws and regulations in many jurisdictions  create heightened risks for the company s international operations 
in the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the company had violated applicable export regulations or anti corruption laws  the company could be fined significant sums  incur sizable legal defense costs and or its export capabilities could be restricted  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company has and will continue to adopt measures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  the company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation 
the company s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits  which may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
avnet historically has pursued a strategic acquisition program to grow its global business for electronic and computer products  thereby enabling avnet to solidify and maintain its leadership position in the marketplace 
acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties such as expansion into new geographic markets and business areas and diversion of management s attention from existing business operations 
in addition  the company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult  costly or time consuming than anticipated 
consequently  the company may experience disruptions that could  depending on the size of the acquisition  have a material adverse effect on its business  especially where an acquisition target may have pre existing non compliance or pre existing deficiencies or material weaknesses as those terms are defined under relevant sec rules and regulations 
furthermore  the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions  which could materially and adversely affect the company s financial performance 
if the company fails to maintain effective internal controls  it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud 
if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud  its brand and operating results could be harmed 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation  the company s business and operating results could be harmed  and the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and the market price of the company s securities 
if the company s internal information systems fail to function properly  or if the company is unsuccessful in the integration or upgrade of information systems  its business operations could suffer 
the company s expanding operations put increasing pressure on the company s information systems to produce timely  accurate and reliable reports on financial and operational results 
currently  the company s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems  some of which are subject to on going it projects designed to streamline or optimize its global information systems 
there is no guarantee that the company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the company s operations or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data 
in addition  these systems are subject to computer hacking or other general system failure 
maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments 
failure of any of these information systems or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on the company s business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws 

table of contents major disruptions to the company s logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe 
the company also depends almost entirely on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers 
a major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our distribution centers for any reason such as natural disasters  pandemics  or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and  as a result  could have a severe impact on the company s business  operations and financial performance 
the company may not have adequate or cost effective liquidity or capital resources 
the company s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets  both of which are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing 
however  external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as of july   avnet had total debt outstanding of billion under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions 
the company needs cash to make interest payments on  and to refinance  this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs 
under the terms of any external financing  the company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants 
any material increase in the company s financing costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
under some of its credit facilities  the company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests 
if the company fails to meet these financial ratios and tests  it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities 
if the company is unable to utilize these facilities  it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general corporate needs 
the agreements governing some of the company s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the company s business 
the agreements governing the company s financing  including its credit facility and the indentures governing the company s outstanding notes  contain various covenants and restrictions that  in certain circumstances  limit the company s ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to grant liens on assets  make restricted payments including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock  make investments  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the company s assets  incur additional debt  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
as a result of these covenants and restrictions  the company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt  compete effectively or make further investments 
in addition to the specific factors described above  general economic or business conditions  domestic and foreign  may be less favorable than management expected and  if such conditions persist for a sustained period of time  could eventually adversely impact the company s sales or its ability to collect receivables from some of its customers

for example  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and similar state laws  avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties  and at off site locations where the company disposed of wastes in the past 
such laws may impose joint and several liability 
typically  however  the costs for cleanup at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party s relative contribution to the contamination  and other factors 
pursuant to sec regulations  including but not limited to item of regulation s k  the company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings  and has concluded that no particular pending environmental legal proceeding requires public disclosure 
based on the information known to date  management believes that the company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimated costs associated with the environmental clean up of sites in which the company is participating 
the company and or its subsidiaries are also parties to various other legal proceedings arising from time to time in the normal course of business 
while litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flow or results of operations

table of contents a as adjusted for the retrospective application of an accounting standard 
the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance which requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the standard requires the convertible debt to be recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance 
the resulting debt discount from this present value calculation is to be recognized as the value of the equity component and recorded to additional paid in capital 
the discounted convertible debt is then required to be accreted up to its face value and recorded as non cash interest expense over the expected life of the convertible debt 
in addition  deferred financing costs associated with the convertible debt are required to be allocated between the debt and equity components based upon relative values 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted this standard  however  there was no impact to the fiscal consolidated financial statements because the company s convertible senior debentures  to which this standard applied  were extinguished in fiscal due to the required retrospective application of this standard to prior periods  the company adjusted the prior period comparative consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes and schedule  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year 
fiscal and contained weeks while fiscal contained weeks 
this extra week  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  impacts the year over year analysis in this md a 
there are references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations 
results for the full fiscal year or were not significantly impacted by the movement of foreign currency exchanges rates as  for example  the us dollar strengthened against the euro by approximately during fiscal and the us dollar weakened against the euro by approximately during fiscal however  fluctuations during the quarters of fiscal had a more pronounced impact on the company s comparative results as described in the company s form q s filed with the sec 
when the stronger us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is a decrease in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
when the us dollar weakens  the resulting impact is an increase in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information  including income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed above 
sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year over year analysis  which included the impact of acquisitions by adjusting avnet s prior periods to include the sales of businesses acquired as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented 
in addition  for fiscal sales are adjusted for i a divestiture by adjusting avnet s prior periods to exclude the sales of the business divested as if the divestiture had occurred at the beginning of the period presented  ii the impact of the extra week of sales in the prior year first quarter due to the week fiscal year  and iii the transfer of the existing embedded business from ts americas to em americas that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal sales taking into account the combination of these adjustments are referred to as pro forma sales or organic sales 
operating income excluding restructuring  integration and other charges incurred in fiscal  and as well as the non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized during fiscal the reconciliation to gaap is presented in the following table 
years ended july  july  june  thousands gaap operating income loss impairment charges restructuring  integration and other adjusted operating income management believes that providing this additional information is useful for the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
furthermore  management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these items and uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 

table of contents results of operations executive summary at the beginning of fiscal  the company completed three significant acquisitions that  when combined with strong organic growth  delivered billion in revenue growth  or  year over year  to a record billion 
although the acquired businesses have product lines with lower operating margins than avnet s other product lines  operating income grew faster than revenue with growth year over year driven by operating leverage and synergies as a result of integration activities that were on going through the fiscal year 
finally  earnings per share on a diluted basis grew faster than revenue and operating income with an increase of year over year 
year over year organic revenue growth for em was and was strongest in the emea region due to demand in the industrial markets 
year over year organic revenue growth for ts was and was driven primarily by demand for storage and servers 
gross profit margin was down basis points year over year to as the acquired bell business has lower gross profit margins than the company s legacy businesses due to its product mix 
em gross profit margin was up basis points year over year which was impacted by the combination of improvement in the em core business  partially offset by the lower gross profit margin embedded business acquired from bell and the embedded business that was transferred from ts americas 
ts gross profit margin declined basis points year over year primarily attributable to the emea region which was impacted by the integration of the bell business because of its lower gross profit margin profile than the other ts emea product lines 
operating income margin was up basis points year over year to 
em operating income margins improved basis points year over year to 
the improvement was attributable to operating leverage primarily in emea which was due to strong revenue growth and continued expense efficiencies 
ts operating income margin declined basis points year over year primarily due to lower operating income margins of the acquired bell business 
the integrations of the acquired businesses have been completed as of the end of fiscal the businesses acquired during fiscal impacted both operating groups and  as a result of integration activities that occurred during the fiscal year  the fiscal results were positively impacted by synergies to the extent actions were completed 
in particular  the expected synergies for the bell acquisition were estimated to be over million in annualized cost savings  however  the full benefit of the synergies is expected to be realized in the first quarter of fiscal three year analysis of sales by operating group and geography years ended percent change july  of july  of june  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating group em americas em emea em asia total em ts americas ts emea ts asia total ts total avnet  inc sales by geographic area americas emea asia pacific

as a result  the goodwill from the recent acquisition was required to be impaired

excluding the benefit related to the release of a tax reserve  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
going forward  the company expects its fiscal year effective tax rate to be more in the range of this adjusted rate rather than the effective tax rate experienced in fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate was impacted primarily by changes to estimates for existing tax positions and net favorable tax audit settlements  offset by a reserve established against certain deferred tax assets 
prior to fiscal  the company had a full reserve against significant tax assets related to a legal entity in emea due to  among several other factors  a history of losses in that entity 
recently  the legal entity has been experiencing improved earnings which required the partial release of the reserve to the extent the entity had taxable income during each of the first three quarters of fiscal and  therefore  positively impacted decreased the company s effective tax rate

avnet s effective tax rate is primarily a function of the tax rates in the numerous jurisdictions in which it does business applied to the mix of pre tax book income 
the effective tax rate may vary year over year as a result of changes in tax requirements in the jurisdictions in which the company does business and management s evaluation of its ability to generate sufficient taxable income to offset net operating loss carry forwards as well as the establishment of reserves for unfavorable outcomes of tax positions taken on certain matters that are common to multinational enterprises and the actual outcome of those matters

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to 
table of contents valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets wherein such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
in determining the company s effective tax rate  management considers current tax regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates  and requires management s judgment for interpretation and application 
changes to such tax regulations or disagreements with the company s interpretation or application by tax authorities in any of the company s major jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s provision for income taxes 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 

table of contents additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
the company is also required to make judgments regarding the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  the results of which would determine whether an interim impairment test must be performed 
should these assumptions or judgments change in the future based upon market conditions or should the structure of the company s reporting units change based upon changes in business strategy  the company may be required to perform an interim impairment test which may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal and  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined there was no goodwill impairment and there are no reporting units with material goodwill that are at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
during fiscal  the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
see impairment charges in this md a for further discussion of the company s evaluation of goodwill impairment in fiscal contingencies and litigation from time to time  the company may become a party to  or otherwise involved in  pending and threatened litigation  tax  environmental and other matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business 
management does not anticipate that any contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
revenue recognition the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business because revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements  from time to time  which are intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at july  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt excludes discounts on long term notes 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt at july  dollars in millions carrying value at fair value at carrying value at fair value at july  july  july  july  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate excludes discounts on long term notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at july  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
