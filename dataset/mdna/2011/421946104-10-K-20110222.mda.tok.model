the proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding balance on the unsecured credit facility  to fund acquisitions and to provide advanced funding for the repayment of the senior notes due the company s results of operations will temporarily be negatively impacted by the interest paid on the senior notes due until they are repaid

the company expects completion of the core and shell of these buildings during the third quarter of the company s ability to complete and stabilize these facilities in a given period of time will impact the company s results of operations and cash flows 
more favorable completion dates  stabilization periods and rental rates will result in improved results of operations and cash flows  while lagging completion dates  stabilization periods and rental rates will result in less favorable results of operations and cash flows 
the company s disclosures regarding projections or estimates of completion dates and leasing may not reflect actual results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s development activities 
in addition to the projects currently under construction  the company has remaining funding commitments totaling million as of december  on five construction loans 
the company expects that these remaining commitments will be funded during and dispositions and impairments during  the company disposed of nine real estate properties for approximately million in net proceeds  received million in lease termination fees  and recognized approximately million in gains from the sale of the properties 
also  three mortgage notes receivable totaling approximately million were repaid 
proceeds from these dispositions were used to repay amounts due under the unsecured credit facility  to fund additional real estate investments  and for general corporate purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these dispositions 
during  the company also recorded impairment charges of approximately million on properties sold during the year or held for sale at december  acquisition in january  the company originated with ladco a million mortgage loan that is secured by a multi tenanted office building located in iowa that was leased at the time the mortgage was originated

in february  the company disposed of a physician clinic located in florida that was previously classified as held for sale and in which the company had a million net investment at december  the company received approximately million in consideration on the sale 
potential dispositions during  the company received notice from a tenant of its intent to purchase six skilled nursing facilities in michigan and indiana pursuant to purchase options contained in its leases with the company 
the company s aggregate net investment in the buildings  which were classified as held for sale upon receiving notice of the purchase option exercise  was approximately million at december  the aggregate purchase price for the properties is expected to be approximately million  resulting in a net gain of approximately million 
the company expects the sale to occur during the third quarter of purchase options as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  certain of the company s leases include purchase option provisions  which if exercised  could require the company to sell a property to a lessee or operator  which could have a negative impact on the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
expiring leases master leases on three of the company s properties that were set to expire during have been renewed 
leases on three other master leased properties are set to expire during the company expects that it will not renew the three remaining master leases but will assume any tenant leases in the buildings and manage the operations of those buildings 
the company also has leases in its multi tenanted buildings that will expire during  with each occupying an average of approximately  square feet 
approximately of these leases are located in on campus buildings  which traditionally have a higher probability of renewal 
the expirations are widely distributed throughout the portfolio and are not concentrated with one tenant  health system or location 
the company expects there could be a short term negative impact to its results of operations from leases that are not renewed but anticipates that over time it will be able to re lease the properties or increase tenant rents to offset any short term decline in revenue 
discontinued operations as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a company must present the results of operations of real estate assets disposed of or held for sale as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations from such assets are classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented are restated to conform to the current period presentation 
readers of the company s consolidated financial statements should be aware that each future disposal will result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical consolidated statements of income as previously filed 
such reclassifications to the consolidated statements of income will have no impact on previously reported net income attributable to common stockholders 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
impairment charges may not be added back to net income attributable to common stockholders in calculating ffo  which have the effect of decreasing ffo in the period recorded 
the comparability of ffo for the three years ended december  was affected by the various acquisitions and dispositions of the company s real estate portfolio and the results of operations of the portfolio from period to period  as well as from the commencement of operations of properties that were previously under construction 
other items also impacted the comparability of ffo between the three years as discussed below and in results of operations interest expense  including interest expense from discontinued operations  increased million  or per diluted common share in compared to due to debt financings  impairment charges totaling million  or per diluted common share  were recorded in relating to five properties classified to held for sale and one property sold during the year 
impairment charges totaling million  or per diluted common share  were recorded in relating to properties sold or held for sale and certain patient receivables assigned to the company as part of a lease termination and debt restructuring  a re measurement gain totaling million  or per diluted common share  was recognized in in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in a joint venture  and a net gain of approximately million  or per diluted common share  was recognized in and a net loss of approximately million  or per diluted common share  was recognized in from the repurchase of a portion of the senior notes due and the senior notes due the senior notes due 
management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization expense 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits and because ffo per share is consistently reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

potential dispositions during  the company received notice from a tenant of its intent to purchase six skilled nursing facilities in michigan and indiana pursuant to purchase options contained in its leases with the company 
the company s aggregate net investment in the buildings  which were classified as held for sale upon receiving notice of the purchase option exercise  was approximately million at december  the aggregate purchase price for the properties is expected to be approximately million  resulting in a net gain of approximately million 
the company expects the sale to occur during the third quarter of purchase options in addition to the six skilled nursing facilities in michigan and indiana discussed above  the company had million in real estate properties at december  that were subject to exercisable purchase options that had not been exercised 
on a probability weighted basis  the company estimates that less than one third of these options might be exercised in the future 
purchase options on two properties in which the company had an aggregate gross investment of approximately million at december  become exercisable during and the company does not believe it can reasonably estimate the probability that these purchase options will be exercised in the future 
construction in progress and other commitments as of december   the company had three medical office buildings under construction in washington and colorado with aggregate budgets of million and estimated completion dates in the third quarter of at december   the company had million invested in these construction projects 
the company also has four parcels of land totaling million in land held for future development that are included in construction in progress on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s construction in progress at december  the company also had approximately million in various first generation tenant improvement budgeted amounts remaining as of december  related to properties that were developed by the company 
further  as of december   the company had remaining funding commitments totaling million on five construction loans that the company expects will be funded during and the company intends to fund these commitments with available cash on hand  cash flows from operations  proceeds from the unsecured credit facility  proceeds from the sale of real estate properties  proceeds from repayments of mortgage notes receivable  proceeds from secured debt  capital market financings  including the company s at the market equity offering program  or private debt or equity offerings 
operating leases as of december   the company was obligated under operating lease agreements consisting primarily of the company s corporate office lease and ground leases related to real estate investments  excluding leases the company has prepaid 
these operating leases have expiration dates through rental expense relating to the operating leases for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
dividends the company is required to pay dividends to its stockholders at least equal to of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a reit 
common stock cash dividends paid during or related to are shown in the table below quarter quarterly dividend date of declaration date of record date paid payable th quarter february  february  march  st quarter may  may  june  nd quarter august  august  september  rd quarter november  november  december  th quarter february  february  march  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent upon its ability to generate funds from operations and cash flows and to make accretive new investments 
liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are dependent upon rental rates on leases  occupancy levels of the multi tenanted buildings  acquisition and disposition activity during the year  and the level of operating expenses  among other factors 
the company plans to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments in  paying dividends  repaying maturing debt and funding other debt service  with available cash on hand  cash flows from operations  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility full capacity available at december   proceeds from mortgage notes receivable repayments  proceeds from sales of real estate investments  or additional capital market financings  including the company s at the market equity offering program  or other debt or equity offerings 
the company also had unencumbered real estate assets with a cost of approximately billion at december   which could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
the company has some exposure to variable interest rates and its stock price has been impacted by the volatility in the stock markets 
however  the company s leases  which provide its main source of income and cash flow  have terms of approximately one to years and have lease rates that generally increase on an annual basis at fixed rates or based on consumer price indices 
impact of inflation inflation has not significantly affected the company s earnings due to the moderate inflation rate in recent years and the fact that most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements require tenants and sponsors to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s risk to the adverse effects of inflation 
in addition  inflation has the effect of increasing gross revenue the company is to receive under the terms of certain leases and financial support arrangements 
leases and financial support arrangements vary in the remaining terms of obligations  further reducing the company s risk to any adverse effects of inflation 
interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is calculated at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the unsecured credit facility is influenced by changes in short term rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
during periods where interest rate increases outpace inflation  the company s operating results should be negatively impacted 
conversely  when increases in inflation outpace increases in interest rates  the company s operating results should be positively impacted 
new accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of new accounting standards 
the company does not believe these new standards will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changing interest rates on its debt and mortgage notes receivable 
management uses regular monitoring of market conditions and analysis techniques to manage this risk 
at december   all of the company s debt totaling billion bore interest at fixed rates 
additionally  million of the company s mortgage notes and other notes receivable bore interest at fixed rates 
the following table provides information regarding the sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments  as described above  to market conditions and changes resulting from changes in interest rates 
for purposes of this analysis  sensitivity is demonstrated based on hypothetical changes in the underlying market interest rates

off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the rules and regulations of the sec 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to exercise judgment and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicates that the recorded value might not be fully recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company s use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell an asset before its depreciable life has ended  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment those assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
if management determines that the carrying value of the company s assets may not be fully recoverable based on the existence of any of the factors above  or others  management would measure and record an impairment charge based on the estimated fair value of the property 
the company recorded impairment charges totaling million   and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and related to real estate properties and other long lived assets 
the impairment charges in included million related to one property sold in and million related to five properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the impairment charge in was recorded in connection with the sale of a property in washington 
the impairment charges in included million related to a long lived asset  million related to two properties sold in  and million related to two properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company s carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values of the properties less costs to sell 
the company also performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the company s reviews are performed as of december of each year 
the company s and reviews indicated that no impairment had occurred with the respect to the company s million goodwill asset 
capitalization of costs gaap generally allows for the capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period incurred vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs of a development project generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and report their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 
acquisition related costs of an existing building include finder s fees  advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  other professional or consulting fees  and certain general and administrative costs 
these costs are also expensed in the period incurred 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized to a project should be reserved for or written off if or when the project is abandoned or circumstances otherwise change that would call the project s viability into question 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for these types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories  of which three relate to development and one relates to acquisitions 
the first category includes pursuits of developments that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes pursuits of developments that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at  which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category includes those pursuits of developments that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse the company s costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes pursuits that involve the acquisition of existing buildings 
as discussed above  costs related to acquisitions of existing buildings are expensed in the period incurred 
each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification  and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
all pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 
as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million and million  respectively  and had provided reserves against its capitalized pursuit costs of million and million  respectively 
depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had investments of approximately billion in depreciable real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  when the company acquires real estate properties with in place leases  the cost of the acquisition must be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
if assumptions used to estimate the as if vacant value of the building or the intangible asset values prove to be inaccurate  the pro ration of the purchase price between building and intangibles and resulting depreciation and amortization could be incorrect 
the amortization period for the intangible assets is the average remaining term of the actual in place leases as of the acquisition date 
to help prevent errors in its estimates from occurring  management applies consistent assumptions with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts 
the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types  adding the future cash flows expected to occur over the next years as a fully occupied building 
the net present value of these future cash flows  discounted using a market rate of return  becomes the estimated as if vacant value of the building 
with respect to the building components  there are several depreciation methods available under gaap 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method the company follows because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company assigns a useful life to its owned buildings based on many factors  including the age of the property when acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  principal and interest payments due on notes and mortgage notes receivable  late fees and additional rent 
payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether it believes the receivable is collectible and whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent  and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 
the company also evaluates collectability of its mortgage notes and notes receivable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan as scheduled  including both contractual interest and principal payments 
the company did not record any provisions for doubtful accounts on its mortgage notes or notes receivable during the three years ended december  management monitors the age and collectibility of receivables on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payments from tenants  sponsors or borrowers 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsor or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the following type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a sponsor guaranty agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  other contractual agreements between the tenant or debtor and the company  relationship between the tenant or debtor and the company  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 
considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
if management determines that some portion of a receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount expected to be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  however  management believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that it re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under stated estimates in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available
