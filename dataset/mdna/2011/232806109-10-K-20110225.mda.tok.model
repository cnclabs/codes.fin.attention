table of contents auction rate securities auction rate securities are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years and are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations with interest rates resetting every seven to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp  which are guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
as of january   all of our auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies and all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack of liquidity  our auction rate securities totaling million are classified as long term investments as of january  if the financial market does not continue to improve  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used at january  were as follows years to liquidity  continued receipt of contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of january   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
as a result of our adoption of the amended other than temporary impairment guidance on debt securities in the second quarter of fiscal  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
equity securities we have equity investments in both public and privately held companies 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on an investment in a public company  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and discounted cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recorded impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as we determined that the decline in value of our equity investments in certain public and privately held companies was other than temporary 
no impairment charge was recorded in fiscal 
table of contents employee deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan  which provides certain key employees  including our executive management  with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax free basis 
we do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments 
participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain our assets and are subject to claims of general creditors 
we account for the deferred compensation plan in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance  under which  the plan assets  which consist of trading securities  are recorded at fair value in each reporting period with the offset being recorded in other income expense  net 
the liabilities are recorded at fair value in each reporting period with the offset being recorded as an operating expense or income 
all non cash expense and income recorded under the deferred compensation plan were included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations year ended january  january  december  in thousands changes in fair value of assets recorded in other income expense  net changes in fair value of liabilities recorded in cost of revenues r d expenses sg a expenses total income expense  net income taxes our income tax expense was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the tax expense in fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to income taxes associated with our non us operations 
the tax expense in fiscal was attributable to non deductible goodwill impairment and debt extinguishment losses  utilization of foreign tax credits and the amortization of deferred tax liabilities associated with purchased intangible assets  partially offset by non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that was not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries and us federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates and a full valuation allowance on net operating losses incurred in the us the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business 
the irs is currently conducting audits of our federal income tax returns for fiscal  and as of january   no material adjustments to the tax liabilities have been proposed by the irs 
however  the irs has not completed their examination and there can be no assurance that there will be no material adjustments upon completion of their review 
in addition  non us tax authorities have completed their examination of our subsidiary in india for fiscal years  and as of january   the proposed adjustments have been appealed 
we believe the ultimate outcome of this appeal will not result in a material adjustment to the tax liability 
while years prior to for the us corporate tax return are not open for assessment  the irs can adjust net operating loss and research and development credit carryovers that were generated in prior years and carried forward to and subsequent years

auction rate securities as of january   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders

table of contents a during the third quarter of  we identified historically immaterial errors related to the value of our raw material inventory balances located in the philippines 
we have determined that these errors were not material to any of the individual prior periods presented and accordingly  the financial statements for the twelve months ended december  have been recast to correct for the immaterial errors 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new standards which amend the consolidation rules related to variable interest entities 
the new standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis and require an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units for accounting purposes 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the arrangement consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software 
these new standards amend the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance tangible products and certain software 
these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of we do not expect these new standards to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
these updated standards also require that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
theses updated standards are effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
except for the level activity disclosure  these updated standards were adopted in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and 
table of contents financial instruments  stock based compensation  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenues by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing service providers emss 
we recognize revenue on sales to oems and emss provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenues are recognized from those distributors when the products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand 
at the time of shipment to those distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred revenue less cost of revenue on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and emss with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale 
historically these volume discounts have not been significant 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary materially from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we record a write down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
as of january   we had total 
table of contents raw materials of million  work in process of million and finished goods of million 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges on our long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed an impairment analysis for our long lived assets and determined that there was no impairment 
valuation of goodwill we tested our goodwill on the reporting unit level 
we have one reporting unit in our consumer and computation division that has goodwill 
management determines the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the reporting unit  and the market approach  which is based on a competitor multiple assessment  if available 
for our reporting unit  we weight the income approach and the market approach 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rates  estimated terminal values and five year annual growth rates  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rates were based upon our weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with our operations 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for our reporting unit 
we performed our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge as there was a substantial difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets of the reporting unit 
in fiscal  as a result of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting our operations and expected future growth as well as the general decline of industry valuations impacting our assessment  we determined that a portion of our goodwill was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million 

table of contents if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or growth rates on our remaining reporting unit are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
fair value of financial instruments we adopted the provisions of the accounting guidance  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance include available for sale investments  employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as such  fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
financial assets utilizing level inputs include us treasuries  most money market funds  marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan  level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
financial assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include foreign currency forward exchange contracts  most commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds  and level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
financial assets utilizing level inputs primarily include auction rate securities 
we use an income approach valuation model to estimate the exit price of the auction rate securities  which is derived as the weighted average present value of expected cash flows over various periods of illiquidity  using a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on the credit risk and liquidity risk of the securities 
availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and to the extent that valuation is based on inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by our management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in regards to our auction rate securities  the income approach valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs 
we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates and ranges of expected periods of illiquidity 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of 
table of contents share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that exposes us to interest rate risk  including  but not limited to  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
auction rate securities as of january   all our auction rate securities are classified as level financial instruments 
auction rate securities are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years 
the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp  which are guaranteed by the us federal department of education 
as of january   all of our auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies and all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack 
table of contents of liquidity  we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of january  if the financial market continues to deteriorate  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used at january  were as follows years to liquidity  continued receipt of contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of january   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
as a result of our adoption of the amended other than temporary impairment guidance on debt securities in the second quarter of fiscal  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the following table summarizes certain information related to our auction rate securities as of january  fair value fair value given a basis point increase in interest rates fair value given a basis point decrease in interest rates in thousands auction rate securities investments in publicly traded and privately held companies we have equity investments in certain publicly traded companies 
the marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gain loss reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the common stock is subject to market price volatility 
the following table summarizes certain information related to these investments as of january  investments fair value fair value given a increase in stock prices fair value given a decrease in stock prices in thousands marketable equity securities we also have equity investments in several privately held companies  many of which are start ups or in development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
we recorded impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as we determined that the decline in value of our equity investments in certain public and privately held companies was other than temporary 
no impairment charge was recorded in fiscal as of january   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we operate and sell products in various global markets and purchase capital equipment using foreign currencies but predominantly the us dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating margins 
for example  when foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  inventory and expenses denominated in foreign currencies become more expensive 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for international customers  thus potentially leading to a reduction in demand  and therefore in our sales and profitability 
furthermore  many of our competitors are foreign companies that could benefit from such a currency fluctuation  making it more difficult for us to compete with those companies 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and results of operations 
we analyzed our foreign currency exposure  including our hedging strategies  to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies 
for those assets and liabilities  we evaluated the effects of a shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar 
we have determined that there would be an immaterial effect on our results of operations from such a shift
