business overview spartech is an intermediary producer of plastic products  including polymeric compounds  concentrates  custom extruded sheet and rollstock products and packaging technologies 
the company converts base polymers or resins purchased from commodity suppliers into extruded plastic sheet and rollstock  thermoformed packaging  specialty film laminates  acrylic products  specialty plastic alloys  color concentrates and blended resin compounds for customers in a wide range of markets 
the company has facilities located throughout the united states  canada  mexico and france that are organized into three segments as follows percentage of net sales custom sheet and rollstock packaging technologies color and specialty compounds in  the company sold its wheels and profiles businesses and closed and liquidated three businesses  including a manufacturer of boat components sold to the marine market and one compounding and one sheet business that previously serviced single customers 
these businesses are classified as discontinued operations and all amounts presented within this item are presented on a continuing basis  unless otherwise noted 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of these divestitures and closures 
the wheels  profiles and marine businesses were previously reported in the engineered products group and due to these dispositions  the company no longer has this reporting group 
the company color and specialty compounds segment sells compounds to a previously divested business and prior to these sales were eliminated as intercompany sales 
in  these sales were reported as external sales to this business  resulting in a increase in consolidated sales and a increase in segment sales during compared to the company assesses net sales changes using three major drivers underlying volume  the impact of business acquisitions or divestitures and price mix 
underlying volume is calculated as the change in pounds sold exclusive of the impact on pounds 
table of contents sold from business acquisitions or divestitures and for a comparable number of days in the reporting period 
the company fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to october and generally contains weeks or calendar days 
executive summary net sales of billion in increased from representing a increase from price mix partially offset by a decrease in volume 
the decrease in volume was due to a decline in sales of sheet for material handling applications caused by a considerable slowdown in orders from one customer 
mitigating this decrease was increased sales volume of compounds and sheet to the automotive and agricultural sectors of our end markets  and compounds to the commercial construction end market from gradual demand recovery 
the price mix increases were related to increases in selling prices to pass through increases in raw material costs and a product mix that included a greater percentage of higher priced products 
operating earnings excluding special items increased by million to million in the million increase in earnings was primarily caused by million of lower selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by million of lower gross margin 
the lower selling  general and administrative expense reflects million of less bad debt expense and million of less foreign currency losses 
the lower gross margin was caused by the decrease in sales volume  production inefficiencies and higher costs 
during  we showed improvements from our turnaround efforts in our color and specialty compounds segment  which we began in the first quarter  and initiated a turnaround effort in the custom sheet and rollstock segment in the third quarter 
in the custom sheet and rollstock segment  we have identified opportunities to improve key metrics by implementing the same turnaround process that has been effective in the color and specialty compounds segment 
we remain committed to the level of work necessary to advance cultural change and achieve earnings growth  but remain realistic with regard to the amount of time required for such change to take root  especially in the challenging economic environment in which we currently operate 
outlook the company made solid progress on its key priorities and turnaround efforts in which established a stronger foundation for future earnings growth 
we expect to build on this foundation and execute on our growth strategy which focuses on continuing to shift our product mix towards more specialized and higher margin products 
while recent customer order patterns have remained stable and resin costs have experienced downward pressure  slow and uncertain demand in the markets we serve and dynamic raw material costs may impact our financial results in future periods 
we expect low to moderate sales volume growth in as well as higher selling prices and a continued shift in mix to higher margin business 
while we expect solid improvement in our earnings per share for the full year compared to  we anticipate our first quarter earnings per share to be a modest loss 
such loss will be comparable to the first quarter of  excluding the benefit from the tax restructuring that occurred in the first quarter of further  we expect that our traditionally weaker first quarter earnings results will be followed by our typically stronger second and third quarter earnings results 
in addition  due to our annual accounting convention  our results will have an extra week and represent a week fiscal year 
we remain committed to providing value to our stockholders through the completion of our turnaround strategy and focus on sustainable growth

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must select and apply various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to apply our accounting policies  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in making such estimates  we rely on historical experience  market and other conditions  and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
accounting policies  estimates and judgments that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
table of contents include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer 
we manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance  and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met 
we monitor and track product returns and the corresponding provisions established 
despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past 
any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
allowance for doubtful trade receivables we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor market and economic conditions as well as collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical write off experience  specific customer collection issues identified  and market and economic conditions 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates 
any significant increase in credit losses in excess of our expectations could have a material negative impact on the value of our trade receivables and operating results and cash flows 
inventory valuation and obsolescence we value inventories at the lower of i cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or ii the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we also buy scrap and recyclable material including regrind material to be used in future production 
we record these inventories initially at purchase price  and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value  we write down the carrying value to realizable value where appropriate 
we review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory 
a significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  most of our business involves the manufacture of custom products  where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand 
although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and operating results

in compliance with asc  property  plant and equipment  fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
such impairment tests compare estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its fair value or  if fair value is not readily determinable  to an estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows  and a corresponding loss is recorded 
the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of fixed asset impairments and the factors which led to these impairments 
goodwill we follow the guidance of asc  business combinations  in recording goodwill arising from a business combination as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the acquired business 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is the first day of the company fourth quarter 
in addition  a goodwill impairment assessment is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires the company to make assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  the allocation of shared or corporate items and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the estimated fair values of each reporting unit are compared to the respective carrying values  which includes allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
management believes the estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable

table of contents accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of goodwill impairments and the factors that led to these impairments 
other intangible assets costs allocated to customer relationships  product formulations and other intangible assets are based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
the cost of other intangible assets is amortized on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful life ranging from two to nineteen years 
in accordance with the asc  intangibles goodwill and other  all amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss 
such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
if the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset  the carrying amount of the intangible asset is reduced by the estimated cash flow shortfall on a discounted basis  and a corresponding loss is recorded 
the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of intangible asset impairments and the factors that led to these impairments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized for credit and net operating loss carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization 
valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
expectations of future earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the ability to carry back losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances 
deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
if those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  we would be required to recognize additional income tax expense 
the company accounts for income taxes under the updated provisions of asc  income taxes 
under this topic of the asc  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
tax authorities regularly examine the company returns in the jurisdictions in which spartech does business 
management regularly assesses the tax risk of the company return filing positions and believes its accruals for uncertain tax benefits are adequate as of october  litigation and other contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including environmental matters 
management routinely assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to those matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  to the extent losses are reasonably estimable 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent that management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact  should an adverse outcome occur  is reasonably estimable 
disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  past experience  interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter 
if the assessment of the various factors changes  the estimates may change 
that may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals and  therefore  could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows in a future reporting period 
restructuring and exit costs the company follows the guidance of asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  in recognizing restructuring costs related to exit or disposal cost obligations 
detailed documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities 
at october   we had million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
based upon the october  balance of the floating rate debt  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would cause an estimated million impact on annual interest expense 
we are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the october  fair values of such instruments are disclosed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk we are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates  including the canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
based upon our october  currency exposures  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso would cause a decrease in future earnings of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
commodity price risk the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
the cost of operations can be affected as the market for these commodities changes 
as the price of resin increases or decreases  market prices for the company products will also generally increase or decrease 
this will typically lead to higher or lower average selling prices and will impact the company gross profit and operating income 
the impact on operating income is due to a lag in matching the change in raw material cost of goods sold and the change in product sales prices 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to resin price changes by entering into indexed product sales pricing contracts with customers and carefully managing the quantity of its inventory on hand
