introduction we are a leader in consumer debt buying and recovery 
we purchase portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value based on robust  account level valuation methods  and employ a suite of proprietary statistical and behavioral models when building account collection strategies 
we use a variety of operational channels to maximize our collections from the portfolios that we purchase  including seeking to partner with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery 
in addition  we provide bankruptcy support services to some of the largest companies in the financial services industry through our wholly owned subsidiary ascension 
while seasonality does not have a material impact on our business  collections are generally strongest in our first calendar quarter  slower in the second and third calendar quarters and slowest in the fourth calendar quarter 
higher relative collections in the first quarter could result in a lower cost to collect ratio compared to the fourth quarter  as our fixed costs would be constant and applied against a larger collection base 
the seasonal impact on our business may be influenced by our purchasing levels  the types of portfolios we purchase and our operating strategies 
collection seasonality can also impact our revenue recognition rate 
generally  revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time  whereas collections can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on seasonality  as described above 
in quarters with lower collections like the th calendar quarter  revenue as a percentage of collections can be higher than in quarters with higher collections like the st calendar quarter 
in addition  seasonality could have an impact on the relative level of quarterly earnings 
in quarters with stronger collections  total costs are higher  as a result of the additional efforts required to generate those collections 
since revenue for each pool group declines steadily over time  in quarters with stronger collections and higher costs like the st calendar quarter  all else being equal  earnings could be lower than in quarters with slower collections and lower costs like the th calendar quarter 

table of contents market overview while there has been improvement in macroeconomic indicators during  including stronger manufacturing and corporate profit metrics  a broad economic recovery has yet to fully materialize for the us consumer 
minimal job growth  uncertainty over state and federal taxes and limited credit availability continue to challenge us consumers  as demonstrated by weak consumer spending and volatile but rising consumer confidence levels 
within the credit card space  we see mixed signals 
although charge off rates remain at historic highs  delinquency levels have improved at a rate that may indicate a fundamental improvement in consumer financial strength 
however  related measures  like personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures  remain elevated and indicate continued near term pressure on the average consumer 
despite this macroeconomic volatility through  most of our internal collection metrics were consistent with  or better than  what we observed in and to illustrate  payer rates and average payment size  adjusted for changes in the mix of settlements in full versus payment plans  remained constant 
however  more of our consumers are opting to settle their debt obligations through payment plans as opposed to one time settlements 
settlements made through payment plans impact our recoveries in two ways 
first  the delay in cash flows from payments received over extended time periods may result in a provision for portfolio allowance 
when a long term payment stream as compared to a one time payment of the same amount is discounted using a pool group s internal rate of return  or irr  the net present value is lower 
in other words  despite the absolute value of total cash received being identical in both scenarios  accounting for the timing of cash flows in a payment plan yields a lower net present value which  in turn  can result in a provision for portfolio allowance 
second  payment plans inherently contain the possibility of consumers failing to complete all scheduled payments  which we term a broken payer 
the rate at which consumers are honoring their obligations and completing their payment plans has increased in when compared to we believe this is the result of two factors our commitment to partner effectively with consumers during their recovery process and the strength of our analytic platform  which allows us to make accurate and timely decisions about how best to maximize our portfolio returns 
nevertheless  payment plans may still produce broken payers that fail to fulfill all scheduled payments 
when this happens  we are often successful in getting the consumer back on plan  but this is not always the case and in those instances where we are unable to do so  we experience a shortfall in recoveries as compared to our initial forecasts 
please refer to management s discussion and analysis revenue below for a more detailed explanation of the provision for portfolio allowances 
throughout the credit crisis  we strategically invested in receivable portfolio as credit card charge offs increased to historic levels and we believe that some of our competitors were i caught owning receivables with low yields as a result of purchasing certain portfolios at elevated pricing levels between and and ii faced with constrained access to capital to fund portfolio purchases due to depressed capital markets 
these dynamics resulted in a supply demand gap that dramatically reduced pricing of available portfolios  beginning in early for example  prices for freshly charged off assets ie  receivables sold within thirty days of charge off by the credit issuers declined from a range of in to a range of in and early similar price reductions were apparent across a broad range of defaulted consumer receivable asset classes including credit cards and other consumer loans  balance ranges and ages 
after such a dramatic decline  pricing has started to increase  but remains favorable when compared to through levels 
in response to the price declines in and early  some issuers opted not to sell all of their receivable portfolio and instead  pursued internal liquidation strategies or partnered with third party agencies 
we believe that as pricing increases  these issuers will sell a greater percentage of their charged off portfolios

portfolio revenue consists of accretion revenue and zero basis revenue 
accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and portfolio allowances 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
all collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered  
table of contents or zero basis portfolios  are recorded as revenue  or zero basis revenue or allowance reversal if applicable 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the authoritative guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality

first  revenue from those portfolios that have a remaining book value and are accounted for on the accrual basis accrual basis portfolios  and second  revenue from those portfolios that have fully recovered their book value zero basis portfolios and  therefore  every dollar of gross collections is recorded entirely as zero basis revenue 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios on the cost recovery method cost recovery portfolios 
no revenue is recognized on cost recovery portfolios until the cost basis has been fully recovered  at which time they become zero basis portfolios

critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios and related revenue 
as permitted by the authoritative guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
the purchase cost of the portfolios includes certain fees paid to third parties incurred in connection with the direct acquisition of the receivable portfolios 

table of contents in compliance with the authoritative guidance  we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an internal rate of return irr  to the cost basis of the pool  which remains unchanged throughout the life of the pool  unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are generally recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s irr over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an allowance to the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction in revenue  with a corresponding valuation allowance  offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or allowance 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s irr applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and portfolio allowances 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios on the cost recovery method as cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
under the cost recovery method of accounting  no income is recognized until the purchase price of a cost recovery portfolio has been fully recovered 
deferred revenue 
we provide bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle and real estate secured loans  on which the consumer has filed for chapter or bankruptcy protection 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew annually 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the time of account referral 
this upfront fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the entire bankruptcy process resulting in the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used rather than actual closure dates 
therefore  the total financial consideration less efforts applied to litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule is recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension is to ensure that the client s claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of ascension s client  and to monitor and or collect the consumer payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy placements is months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is recognized ratably  including any upfront fees we received over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event  with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter and bankruptcy placements is reviewed periodically for changes 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related consumer has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has  to date  been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs  or deferred 
table of contents court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced and recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 
deferred court costs not recovered within three years of placement are fully written off 
effective october   we changed our estimate for deferred court costs 
see change in accounting estimate below for further discussion of deferred court costs 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rates and foreign currency 
our interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging 
the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging requires that qualifying derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives  if any  is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
see note derivatives and hedging instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
stock based compensation 
we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of income 
when we reduce our valuation allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax benefit in our statement of income 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
use of estimates 
we have made significant estimates with respect to the rate of return established to recognize accretion revenue on our receivable portfolios and with respect to the provision for allowances of receivable portfolios 
in connection with these estimates  we have made significant estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from receivable portfolios owned 
significant estimates have also been made with respect to ascension s service revenue  the realizability of our net deferred court costs  intangible assets  net deferred tax assets and tax reserve  stock based compensation  and the potential liabilities with respect to our health benefits plans 
change in accounting estimate 
as described in deferred court costs above  we capitalize deferred court costs in our consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
at the end of each quarter we evaluate our recovery rate estimate for deferred court 
table of contents cost 
effective october  we revised our estimate of deferred court costs based on additional data that we have accumulated over the last four years 
this data informs us as to which consumers will ultimately repay their debts and reimburse us for the court costs we incurred 
this data indicated that we would recover a greater percentage of court costs advanced than we had originally expected 
this expectation is largely attributable to our greater precision around which consumers are best suited for litigation and are more likely to settle their accounts with us 
as such  we increased our court cost recovery estimate to better reflect our revised recovery expectations 
this change was treated as a change in estimate in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting changes and error corrections 
the impact of this change in estimate resulted in an increase in our deferred court cost asset of million as of october   and resulted in a million reduction in our court cost expense  a million increase in our net income and a increase in our earnings per share for the year ended december  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency 
we have operations in india  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in indian rupees  such as employee salaries and rent expenditures 
we continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable 
such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that hedge our risk of foreign currency exchange against the indian rupee 
each contract settles monthly with a notional amount of an usd equivalent of million and hedges the forecasted monthly cash settlements resulting from the expenses incurred by our operations in india 
since a significant portion of our foreign currency transactions is hedged through the forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the foreign exchange rate against the indian rupee would not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income 
interest rate 
as of december   we had total variable interest bearing borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  thus subjecting us to interest rate risk 
we manage our interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
we entered into several receive floating pay fixed interest rate swaps to hedge against potential changes in cash flows on our outstanding variable interest bearing debt 
the receive variable leg of the swaps and the variable rate paid on the underlying debt bear the same rate of interest  excluding the credit spread  and reset and pay interest on the same dates 
as of december   we have five interest rate swap contracts with financial counterparties with a total notional amount of million 
the contracts bear fixed annual interest rates ranging from to 
from the inception of the hedging program  the swaps have been determined to be highly effective 
a hypothetical change in the interest rates would not have an impact on our interest expense on the million hedged portion of our variable interest bearing debt 
the remaining million of our revolving credit facility is subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase  interest expense on such outstanding debt would increase by approximately million  on an annualized basis 
conversely  if the market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense on such outstanding debt would decrease by million
