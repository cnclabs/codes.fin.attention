actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 
critical accounting policies orrstown s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
management  in order to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements  is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements are filed with the commission 
as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  the company has identified the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment  and accounting for income taxes as critical accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the company in connection with its acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
various market valuation methodologies are used to determine the fair value of the 
table of contents reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment expense may be required to be recorded to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
to date  the company has not had to take an impairment charge on its goodwill 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences and tax credits 
enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the company s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
as of december   management has concluded that a valuation allowance is not needed on its net deferred tax asset 
readers of the consolidated financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the company s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the company at that time

orrstown financial services  inc moved from the otc bulletin board to the nasdaq capital market during trading began on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol orrf on april  the company joined the broad market russell index on june  when russell investments reconstituted its us and global indexes 
the company is also part of the russell index  a subset of the russell that measures the performance of companies ranked   by market capitalization 
economic climate  inflation and interest rates during  the us economy faced significant challenges resulting in an overall economic downturn 
poor economic conditions  which were initially evident within the residential housing market beginning in  spread throughout most sectors of the economy in the economic malaise has continued through the early stages of the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  and therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last five years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is present given changing trends in the economy 
as the company s balance sheet consists primarily of financial instruments  interest income and interest expense is greatly influenced by the interest rates and the slope of the interest rate curve 
during the five years presented in this financial statement review  interest rates were relatively high when the economy was perceived as strong  however  as the national and local economy began experiencing financial difficulties and higher levels of unemployment  rates decreased quickly 
one example of this is the prime lending rate  which reached a high during the five year period of in september however  the prime lending rate was reduced basis points over a month period  coinciding with the country s economic struggles  and ended with a published prime lending rate of 
the published prime lending rate remains at at december  management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance 
despite the challenging economic conditions during and into  the company believes it is positioned to withstand these conditions through its strong capital and liquidity positions  high quality loan and debt securities portfolios and prudent management of credit and interest rate risk 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of  an increase of over earnings of  which was a increase over net income of  realized in basic earnings per share have increased over the last three years from in to in and in diluted earnings per share have increased as well  from in  to in and to in the company s earnings performance continues to exceed peer group averages as measured by various ratio analyses 
two widely recognized performance indicators are the return on average assets roa and the return on average equity roe 
the average publicly traded banking company and the average billion to billion in assets banking company generated roas of approximately and  respectively  during per snl financial  a provider of financial information for the banking industry

return on average 
table of contents tangible assets rota and return on average tangible equity rote ratios exclude intangibles from the balance sheet and related amortization and tax expense from net income and is also presented 
the company has goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of companies and purchased deposits 
the following table compares the last three years performance ratios 
performance statistics return on average assets return on average tangible assets return on average equity return on average tangible equity average equity average assets net interest income the primary component of the company s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowed funds 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the net interest spread and net interest margin nim are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
through the use of demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the net interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
the analysis of net interest income table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income below analyzes the changes in net interest income for the same periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a full tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the increase in net interest income was an increase in average earning assets from  in to  in supplementing the growth in volume  was an increase in net interest margin of basis points b 
p  from in to for as summarized on the rate volume table   of the growth in net interest income was achieved from volume  and  was achieved through an increase in nim 
the largest portion of the increase in interest income was the result of interested earned on the securities portfolio  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over year over year  average securities increased  or 
partially offsetting the increase on securities earnings due to volume was a reduction in the interest rate earned of in to in the growth in securities was funded principally through the growth in money market and time deposit accounts 
average interest bearing deposits increased  or  resulting from the company s overall customer service model  its market position in several attractive markets  and due to the favorable rating 
table of contents the bank has received from idc financial publishing  inc idc  an independent bank safety rating agency which uses its unique rankings of financial ratios to determine the quality ratings of financial institutions 
this strong rating facilitates the company s ability to attract time deposits and brokered deposits 
despite an increase in the average balance of time deposits of  for the year ended december  compared to  the total interest expense was lowered by  the average volume resulted in an increase of interest expense of  which was more than offset by a decrease in interest expense that resulted from a decrease in the yield paid on time deposits  of basis points from to  of  the company recognizes that brokered funds are more volatile funding source than core deposits 
however  given the current interest rate environment and the steepness of the interest rate curve  the company elected to collect these funds and earn a spread on them in order to enhance net interest income 
given the increased volatility in brokered deposits  the company invested a large portion of these amounts in mortgage backed securities  which provide a regular stream of monthly cash flows  which can be used to meet the maturity needs of time and brokered deposits 
we have matched cash flows from the debt securities portfolio with nontraditional cash flows to enable us to unwind the strategy if loan demand continues to increase or if the yield curve flattens 
the growth in the loan portfolio also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
year over year  average loans increased  or  from the year ended december  to december  the increase in average loans is the result of the company s desire to continue to grow its loan portfolio and deploy its capital 
this growth has come principally in some of the company s less mature markets  in which we have hired additional lending officers  which has increased opportunities in these markets served 
the growth experienced in the loan portfolio was achieved primarily in the second half of the year  in which approximately two thirds of the growth was achieved 
the  growth in average balance in loans contributed  in additional interest income in compared to however  the rate earned on loans of was bp less than in  and offset interest income by  the company continues to have  in notional amount of interest rate swaps which serve as a hedge against variable rate commercial loans linked to prime and converts them to a fixed rate of interest 
the interest rate swaps that the company had outstanding during yielded  which was credited and included as commercial loan interest income 
as noted above  the company has been able to increase its deposit base 
as a result  less reliance has been placed on more costly long term borrowings 
interest expense on long term debt has decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  in reduction in average daily balance of  for compared to reduced interest expense by  and the reduction in the rate paid on long term borrowing of bp reduced interest expense by  the growth that the company has experienced  and its ability to lower its cost of funding by an amount greater than its reduction in rates earned on interest earning assets  has resulted in a slight improvement in both the interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the average rates earned on assets were for the year ended december  compared to in  whereas the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities declined from in to in this resulted in a net interest rate spread of in compared to in versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the increase in net interest income was an increase in average earning assets from  in to  in offsetting the growth in volume was a decrease in net interest margin of basis points from to 
net interest margin compacted appreciably beginning in the fourth quarter of given the federal reserve bank s significant cut to the federal funds rates 
those cuts served to lower the prime lending rate by similar amounts and the company had approximately one third of its assets tied to wall street journal prime 
actions taken by management at that time included the installation of interest rate floors on all new commercial loans  and the placement of  notional amount of prime for fixed interest rate swaps 
the company was able to stabilize its net interest margin during the latter half of as a result of the actions taken  which continued through 
table of contents going forward  the company s ability to maintain its historically strong growth trend in net interest income will be challenged by expected pressure in net interest income 
this pressure could be attributable to the following factors the cash flows that result from deposit maturities will not experience the same magnitude of downward re pricing experienced in and  as many of these deposits have matured once already in the low rate environment 
presently the interest rate yield curve is relatively steep  with the spread between the two and ten year treasuries being at december  if the yield curve were to flatten some  net interest margin could be negatively impacted 
the company expects to mitigate these factors by continuing to improve the mix of earning assets through loan growth and a disciplined approach to the pricing of loans and deposits

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses has increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in  an increase of  or  in  the provision for loan losses increased  from that expensed in  which totaled the increases that the company has experienced in its provision for loan losses have partially resulted from the growth it has experienced in its loan portfolio 
in addition  the increase in the provision for loan losses for the periods presented can be attributed to declining asset quality and higher charge offs during his time period 
increases in non performing assets and charge offs has been an industry wide trend both at the national and local levels

consumer habits continued to change and the popularity of the reward checking product increased

an increase in trust department and brokerage income of  or for the twelve months ended december  compared to were the result of increases in trust and brokerage activity as the stock market has started to show signs of recovery  and additional trust and brokerage assets under management  which increased from  at december  to  at december  the continued decline in mortgage interest rates has led to an increase in new mortgage loan applications as well as refinancing activities 
given these low interest rates  the company generally sells its year conforming loans to investors 
the increase in activity has resulted in gains on sales of loans increasing to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  in earnings on life insurance increased  from  for the year ended december  to  in the increase was principally the result of  in life insurance death benefits that was realized upon the deaths of former directors in  with no similar gains noted in included in other income for the twelve months ended december  was the gain on the sale of a fixed for prime floating rate swap  with a notional value of  that was recorded in the second quarter totaling  in connection with the company s asset liability management  it was

no similar gain on the settlement of swaps occurred in the company continued to harvest gains on securities available for sale when it was strategically determined that the gains afforded on certain securities was more beneficial than the interest rate earned 
accordingly  gains on securities were  for the year ended december  compared to  in the company continues to advertise and market itself in order for consumers to recognize the broad range of financial services and products the company has to offer  and to increase its brand recognition

the dodd frank bill currently contains provisions that may limit the company s ability to earn debit card interchange fees in the second half of despite the fact the bank is below billion in assets and would not be subject to limitations on fees charged to customers  its service provider exceeds the billion threshold 
in the event the service provider is not able to differentiate between banks above and below the threshold  interchange fee income would be negatively impacted 
the company continues to discuss this matter with the service provider  and is exploring other alternatives in the event a satisfactory resolution to the matter is not achieved 
in addition  because the company s competitors having assets in excess of billion will not be able to charge debit card interchange fees  competitive pressures may cause the company to reduce or eliminate its interchange fee charges

financial condition the quality of the company s asset structure continues to be strong 
a substantial amount of time is devoted by management to overseeing the investment of funds in loans and securities and the formulation of policies directed toward the profitability and minimization of risk associated with such investments 

table of contents securities available for sale the company utilizes securities available for sale as a tool for managing interest rate risk  enhancing income through interest and dividend income  to provide liquidity and to provide collateral for certain deposits and borrowings 
as of december   securities available for sale were  a  increase from the december  balance of  the company has established investment policies and an asset management policy to assist in administering its investment portfolio 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions and management s strategy to respond to changes in interest rates  liquidity  securitization of deposits and repurchase agreements and other factors while obtaining the maximum return on the investments 
under generally accepting accounting principles  the company may segregate its investment portfolio into three categories securities held to maturity  trading securities and securities available for sale 
management has classified the full securities portfolio as available for sale 
securities available for sale are to be accounted for at their current market value with unrealized gains and losses on such securities to be excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in other comprehensive income 
the company s securities available for sale include debt and equity instruments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk 
this risk arises from general market conditions  factors impacting specific industries  as well as corporate news that may impact specific issues 
management continuously monitors its debt securities  including updates of credit ratings  monitoring market  industry and segment news  as well as volatility in market prices 
the company uses various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired  including the extent of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position  and the extent of the unrealized loss 
in addition  management assesses whether it is likely the company will have to sell the security prior to recovery  or if it is able to hold the security until the price recovers 
for those debt securities in which management concludes the security is other than temporarily impaired  it will recognize the credit component of an other than temporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income 
given the strong asset quality of the debt security portfolio  management has not had to take an other than temporary impairment charge in for equity securities  when the company has decided to sell an impaired available for sale security and does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover before the expected time of sale  the security is deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when the impairment is deemed other than temporary even if a decision to sell has not been made

table of contents  during the year ended december  sales of securities were taken in anticipation of rising interest rates  in order to protect earnings 
in addition  given the growth in the portfolio  management had to reposition a portion of its portfolio for interest rate risk management purposes 
the majority of the growth in the securities available for sale portfolio was in the us government sponsored enterprises residential mortgage backed securities  which grew from  at december  to  an increase of  given the increased volatility in brokered deposits that were used to fund the growth in securities  the company invested a large portion of these amounts in residential mortgage backed securities  which provide a regular stream of cash flows  which can be used to meet the maturity needs of the time and brokered deposits

loan portfolio the company offers various products to meet the credit needs of our borrowers  and principally consists of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  and retail loans consisting of loans securitized by residential properties  and to a lesser extent  installment loans 
generally speaking  the company follows conservative lending practices and continues to carry a high quality loan portfolio with no unusual or undue concentrations of credit 
no loans are extended to non domestic borrowers or governments 
with certain exceptions  we are permitted under applicable law to make loans to single borrowers including certain related persons and entities in aggregate amounts of up to of the sum of total capital and the allowance for loan losses 
the company s legal lending limit to one borrower was approximately  at december   however  our largest exposure to any one borrower as of that date was approximately  the company s loan portfolio is broken down into segments to an appropriate level of disaggregation to allow management to monitor the performance by the borrower and to monitor the yield on the portfolio 
in  management incorporated the provisions of asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for loan losses  resulting in the refinement in its portfolio segregation 
consistent with this standard  the segments were further broken down into classes  to allow for differing risk characteristics within a segment 

table of contents management feels that non owner occupied commercial real estate  consisting of nonresidential properties  pose a greater risk than owner occupied and multi family residential properties 
likewise  a family residential construction class is broken out of the acquisition and development loan segment  leaving a commercial and land development class that presents a higher risk profile 
in commercial and land development projects  many times the ultimate buyer of the property is not known at the time the project is started  and the real estate collateral cannot generally be subdivided into smaller parcels to diversify the developer s risk 
first lien residential mortgage loans generally are less susceptible to loss than home equity loans  which generally have higher loan to values associated with them 
balances as of december  have been reclassified to be consistent with s presentation 
however  have not been reclassified  and are presented separately 
the loan portfolio  excluding residential loans held for sale  broken out by classes as of december is as follows dollars in thousands commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans in addition to the company monitoring its loan portfolio by type  it also monitors concentrations to one industry

the following industries meet the concentration criteria defined by the bank s lending policy at december  dollars in thousands balance of total loans of bank s equity land subdivision lessors of residential buildings and dwellings lessors of nonresidential buildings hotels except casinos and motels 
table of contents the loan portfolio as of december   and  generally broken down by the underlying security of the loans  is as follows dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total loans the loan portfolio at december  has grown from december   from million to million 
the company continued to experience growth in its commercial real estate and commercial portfolios  which grew and in several experienced lenders have joined the company in the past two years  which has led to additional opportunities in some of the company s emerging markets 
first lien residential mortgage loans have grown million from million at december  to million at december  this growth is principally the result of management s intention to retain some of the shorter lived mortgages  generally with maturities of years  in its portfolio 
this strategy is to help diversify the loan portfolio  and as these mortgages earn more attractive rates than alternative investments  including federal funds sold and securities available for sale 
longer termed residential mortgage loans continue to be sold on the secondary market  as they present greater interest rate risk 
installment loans and combined home equity loans have decreased since  as consumer spending and related borrowing has declined in this uncertain economy

table of contents asset quality risk elements the company s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through conservative underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also mitigate the company s risk of credit loss 
the company s loan portfolio is principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and washington county  maryland 
as the majority of loans are concentrated in this geographic region  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
in addition  loans past due days or more and still accruing are also deemed to be a risk asset 
the accrual of interest income on loans ceases when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is inadequate to cover principal and interest or immediately if  in the opinion of management  full collection is unlikely 
interest accrued  but not collected  as of the date of placement on nonaccrual status  is generally reversed and charged against interest income  unless fully collateralized 
subsequent payments received are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal 
past due status is based on contract terms of the loan 
a loan is considered restructured if the terms of a loan  such as the interest rate or repayment schedule  or both  are modified to terms that the company would not have granted originally due to the financial difficulties of the borrower 
the following table presents the company s risk elements  including information concerning the aggregate balances of nonaccrual  restructured  loans past due days or more  and foreclosed real estate as of december additionally  relevant asset quality ratios are also presented

table of contents a further breakdown of nonaccrual loans and loans past due days or more still accruing as of december  and is as follows nonaccrual loans past due days or more still accruing commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity installment and other loans as noted in the above tables  the company has experienced an increase in risk assets from  which coincides with the downturn in the state and local economy  and softness that has been experienced in the real estate market 
improvement was made since march principally through the reduction in the level of non accrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing  and total delinquency 
the company continues to be diligent in its handling of nonperforming and other risk assets and has been able to reduce the level of risk assets from a high of  at march  to  at december  total risk assets have increased  from december  two large credits  totaling  million  have been worked off the books since march  which resulted in a million charge off in the second quarter of as a result of the increase in risk assets  the company has experienced an increase in its ratio of total risk assets to total assets from at december  to at december  increases in risk assets have been experienced by financial institutions both at a national and local level and the company has seen increases as well 
it should be noted that the ratio of total risk assets to total assets reached its high of at march   and the company has been able to continue to work through its problem assets 
as of december   the company has commercial relationships that are included in the nonaccrual loan balance of  the largest of these relationships has total outstanding loan balances of  consisting of advances under a line of credit to a company that finances interim construction financing for mortgages  residential manufactured  modular and site built homes 
as a result of the downturn in the housing market  the company experienced financial difficulties and declared bankruptcy in the first quarter of the bank is in the process of pursuing a recovery of the amounts owed to it in the bankruptcy court proceedings as well as through other avenues of recovery that may be available to it including  without limitation  the guarantees provided by the principals and other potential claims against third parties 
a second relationship in nonaccrual status at december   with an outstanding loan balance of  is to a professional service firm that provides services in the construction industry 
again  as result of the downturn in the economy  this firm has experienced financial difficulties and has not been able to meet their debt service requirements  resulting in the loan being placed in nonaccrual status 
the bank is in process of working out this relationship with the borrower  and will pursue recovery methods 
the loan is secured by the commercial real estate  personal residences of the guarantors and ucc filings on the company s assets 

table of contents a third relationship at december  included in the nonaccrual balance consists of a mixed use building  consisting of residential apartments and commercial retail space that has had difficulties in securing leases from tenants that will enable it to meet its debt service requirements 
the bank is working with the borrower through the lease up period  in order to allow sufficient time to increase the building s occupancy 
this loan is secured by the commercial real estate property and has a loan balance at december  of a fourth relationship consists of a motel which is presently closed  but has a pending contract on the sale of the property 
the company continues to work through this loan  with a balance of  at december  the company believes through the combination of the collateral securing the loans and the reserves allocated for these nonaccrual loans totaling  it has provided for the potential losses that it may incur on these relationships as of december  however  as additional time passes on these relationships  additional information may become known that could result in additional reserve allocations  or  alternatively  it may be deemed that the reserve allocations exceed that which is needed 
in  the company restructured two residential mortgages in order to assist the borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulties 
the restructured loans resulted in concessions that the bank made in interest rates for a short less than twelve months period of the remaining amortization schedule  and resulted in a reduction of the discounted cash flows of the loans  based on the original loans interest rate  of approximately  the company experienced a slight increase in foreclosed real estate balances at december  of  compared to december  of  as of december   nine properties are owned by the company  two of which are commercial properties and total  and the remaining seven consisting of residential properties and total  of the seven residential properties  four were owned by the company for over months 
for the year ended december   the company updated its fair value assessment of these four properties which have been owned for over months  and recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of  as of december   the company believes the value of foreclosed assets represents their fair values  but if the real estate market continues to remain soft  additional charges may be needed 
credit risk management allowance for loan losses historically  the company has had an enviable record regarding its control of loan losses  but lending is a banking service that inherently contains elements of risk 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
it is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses utilizing a defined methodology  which considers specific credit evaluation of impaired loans as discussed above  past loan loss 
table of contents historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management believes the approach properly addresses the requirements of asc section for loans individually identified as impaired  and asc subtopic for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  and other bank regulatory guidance 
in order to monitor ongoing risk associated with its loan portfolio and specific credits within the segments  management uses an eight point internal grading system 
the first four rating categories  representing the lowest risk to the bank  are combined and given a pass rating 
the special mention category includes loans that have potential weaknesses that may  if not monitored or corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s position at some future date 
these assets pose elevated risk  but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe  or criticized rating 
bank s management generally follows regulatory definitions in assigning criticized ratings to loans  including substandard  doubtful or loss 
substandard loans are classified as they have a well defined weakness  or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
generally loans greater than days past due are assigned a substandard rating 
a doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss  but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset  its classification of loss is deferred 
loss assets are considered uncollectible  as the underlying borrowers are often in bankruptcy  have suspended debt repayments  or ceased business operations 
once a loan is classified as loss  there is little prospect of collecting the loan s principal or interest and it is generally written off 
the bank has a loan review policy and program which is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
the credit administration committee  comprised of members of the board  is charged with the overall credit quality and risk exposure of the company s loan portfolio 
this includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all bank personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
the loan review program provides the bank with an internal  independent review of the bank s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
generally  consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass categories unless a specific action  such as extended delinquencies  bankruptcy  repossession or death of the borrower occurs  which heightens awareness as to a possible credit event 
the loan review department performs annual reviews of all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of  with ratification of the rating from the board of directors credit administration committee for loans between   loans reviewed in excess of  are presented to the credit administration committee with a formal review and rating 
all relationships rated substandard  doubtful or loss are reviewed by the credit administration committee on a quarterly basis  including reaffirmation of the rating  review of detailed collateral analysis and the development of an action plan 

table of contents the following summarizes the bank s ratings based on its internal risk rating system as of december  dollars in thousands pass special mention substandard doubtful loss total commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans classified loans may also be evaluated for impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  construction and restructured loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
during the year  the bank modified its criteria for identifying impaired loans  as performing substandard loans were no longer considered impaired 
larger groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 

table of contents the following summarizes impaired loans by class  segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not required as of december impaired loans with a specific allowance impaired loans with no specific allowance dollars in thousands recorded investment book balance unpaid principal balance legal balance related allowance interest income recognized on cash basis recorded investment book balance unpaid principal balance legal balance interest income recognized on cash basis december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term impaired loans with specific allowance impaired loans with no specific allowance dollars in thousands recorded investment related allowance december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial the following presents impaired loans that are troubled debt restructurings as of december  the bank did not have any troubled debt restructurings at december  troubled debt restructurings at december  new troubled debt restructurings during current ytd period dollars in thousands number of contracts recorded investment number of contracts recorded investment residential mortgage first lien home equity term no additional commitments have been made to borrowers whose loans are considered trouble debt restructurings 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans  which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which 
table of contents may result in the reporting of these loans as non performing loans in the future 
generally  management feels that substandard loans that are currently performing and not considered impaired  result in some doubt as to the borrower s ability to continue to perform under the terms of the loan  and represent potential problem loans 
management further monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the length of time a portfolio is past due  by aggregating loans based on its delinquencies 
the following table presents the classes of loan portfolio summarized by aging categories of performing loans and nonaccrual loans as of december  current days past due total past due still accruing non accrual total loans dollars in thousands still accruing commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans general allowances are provided for loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  which is based on quantitative factors  principally historical loss trends for the respective loan class  adjusted for qualitative factors 
as of december   the historical loss trend is based on rolling quarters with a two third weight to the most recent four quarters  and a one third weight for the furthest four quarters 
prior to december   the historical loss factor was based on an equally weighted rolling quarters 
additional qualitative factors are used by management to adjust the historical loss percentage to the anticipated losses within the portfolio  and include national and local economic trends  levels and trends of delinquency rates and nonaccrual loans  effects of changes in underwriting policies  experience  ability and depth of lending and loan review staff  trends in values of underlying collateral including the real estate market  and concentrations of credit from loan type  or shifts in industry or geographic region

net charge offs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   with the majority of the charge offs coming in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and commercial and land development loan portfolios 
during  the company recorded provision for loan losses totaling  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in the provision was a direct result of the higher level of net charge offs  combined with the growth that company has experienced in its loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses covered s net charge offs times 
management believes the resultant level of provision for and allowance for loan losses to be adequate  given the growth in the company s loan portfolio  level of credit quality indicators  and related mix of loans 

table of contents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses  as well as the percent of each loan type in relation to the total loan balance  is as follows dollars in thousands amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity installment and other loans unallocated dollars in thousands amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer unallocated total

as previously noted  in management re evaluated and made certain modifications to its methodology in establishing a reserve to better account for risks inherent in the different segments of the portfolio  particularly in light of increased charge offs  with noticeable differences between the different loan segments 
management believes these periodic enhancements to the allowance for loan losses methodology improves the accuracy of quantifying losses presently inherent in the portfolio  and does not impact the trends or comparability of the periods presented above 
management charges actual loan losses to the reserve and bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
the largest component of the reserve as of the last two years has been allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio 
this reflects the inherent greater risk associated with this portfolio  as evidenced by the greater amounts of net charge offs within the portfolio 
further  as noted in the risk elements discussion  the amount of commercial and industrial loans on nonaccrual status has increased from  at december  to  at december  an increase in the reserve allocated to non owner occupied commercial real estate of  was also provided  reflective of continued softening of real estate prices  increased vacancies  and the resulting strain it has caused on the borrowers cash flows 
one segment that has had a reduction in its allocation of the allowance for loan losses is commercial and land development  which was  at december  compared to  at december  this reduction is principally the result of one large relationship that was charged off in in the amount of  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
this reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocation  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions and other factors management believes appropriate at the time 
the unallocated portion of the allowance has declined in  driven by the enhancements implemented in  which resulted in additional qualitative amounts being allocated to each portfolio  thereby reducing the amount of unallocated that was required for imprecision in the calculation 

table of contents while management believes the company s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  regulatory guidance  or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
deposit products on an average daily basis  total deposits grew or  over  which continued on the trend of  in which average daily balance increased 
at december   total deposits grew to  compared to  at year end  or a increase 
each category of time deposits experienced growth on an average daily basis in as compared to the two categories that have experienced the most significant growth were interest bearing demand deposits  which grew  or  and time deposits  which grew by  or on an average daily balance basis 
given current economic times and market conditions  it has been noted that consumers are saving more  combined with our strong capital position  strong focus on our customer needs and service  and competitive pricing has allowed the company to attract more demand deposits  including checking and money market products 
additionally  the company has a strong idc financial publishing  inc idc rating  an independent bank safety rating which uses unique rankings of financial ratios to determine the quality ratings of financial institutions 
this strong rating allows the company to attract larger types of deposits  including time deposits  those in excess of  and brokered deposits 
as of december   the company had brokered deposits totaling  which was a significant increase over the balance of  at december  as noted above  the bank s idc rating has led to an opportunity to obtain this relatively cheap funding source  which it can use to reduce its reliance on more expensive other borrowing types  or invest in loans or securities 
the company recognizes that brokered funds result in greater volatility as a funding source  but given the current interest rate environment and the steepness of the interest rate curve  elected to use these funds and earn a spread on them to increase net interest as previously discussed 
given the increased volatility in brokered deposits  the company invested a large portion of these amounts in mortgage backed securities  which provide a steady stream of cash flows  which are used to meet the maturity needs of time and brokered deposits 
management continually evaluates interest rate conditions  including the interest rate curve 
brokered and other time deposit balances may be less emphasized in the future if interest rate conditions are less advantageous to the company s net interest income

the largest component of short term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with deposit customers  in which the customer sweeps a portion of its deposit balance into a repurchase agreement  which is a secured borrowing as a pool of securities are pledged against the balances

table of contents capital adequacy and regulatory matters the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to its stockholders while maintaining sufficient levels of capital and related risk based regulatory capital ratios to satisfy statutory regulatory requirements 
orrstown s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to its shareholders  while maintaining a well capitalized position of regulatory strength 
total shareholders equity increased  from  at december  to  at december  historically  earnings retention  defined as net income  less dividends declared  has served as a primary source of capital to the company and has been accomplished with a dividend payout ratio of less than over the last five years 
earnings retained during totaled  on february   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s  with the securities and exchange commission  that provided the company the ability to raise capital  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million  through the sale of stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and other securities 
the company completed a public stock offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of approximately  during the first quarter of net proceeds after underwriting commissions and expenses were  although the company recognized this offering would initially dilute earnings per share and reduce return on equity and tangible equity performance measurements  management felt it was necessary in order to support the continued growth of the company 
the additional capital allowed the company to bolster its regulatory capital ratios during a time of an uncertain economy and the potential for increased government oversight and perhaps higher regulatory capital requirements 
as noted below  the company s capital ratios have increased significantly as a result of the stock offering 
the company feels with this additional capital  it positions itself well to weather the economy and take advantage of future opportunities that may arise 
the company has no current plans to issue additional shares of common stock 
in addition to the increase in shareholders equity that resulted from the stock offering and earnings retention  shareholders equity increased  through the issuance of new shares for stock compensation and dividend reinvestments plans  and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income  as more fully outlined on the statement of shareholders equity included in
