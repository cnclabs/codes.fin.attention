item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
intellectual property the name lowe s is a registered service mark of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business 
this subsidiary has various additional registered trademarks  trade names and service marks  most of which are used in our private brand program 
environmental leadership we continue to build on a history of environmental leadership by helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money through a growing number of product and service solutions 
we offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy efficient products for the home  from energy star appliances to paint with no volatile organic compounds voc 
some highlights of our environmental leadership include the us environmental protection agency awarded us two consecutive energy star sustained excellence awards in retail  which recognizes our long standing leadership as a retailer of energy efficient products  as well as nine consecutive energy star awards  including four energy star partner of the year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency

in addition to operating our stores as efficiently as possible by reducing our energy and water usage  we are striving to get products to our stores in an environmentally responsible manner 
our conservation strategies and continued contributions to the transportation industry have been honored by multiple smartway environmental excellence awards  an innovative program launched by the us environmental protection agency in that represents environmentally cleaner  more fuel efficient transportation options 
to earn those awards  we implemented initiatives that resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and less overall highway congestion 
these included increasing shipping by rail  increasing efficiency of truckload shipments  allowing more products to be shipped on fewer trailers  and continuing to use a higher percentage of smartway carriers 
compliance with environmental matters our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
they have in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways  including indirectly through increased energy costs as producers of energy and petroleum  and potentially other major emitters of greenhouse gases  are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations

item a risk factors we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys  external research  risk mapping  analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational  financial  environmental  reputational  strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business 
for more information about our risk management process  which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify  see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders under the board s role in risk oversight 
we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or business prospects 
these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended  supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form k  form q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form k  in our annual report to lowe s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission  as well as in our press releases and other public communications  are qualified by the risks described below 
our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 
general economic factors and other conditions  both domestically and internationally  may adversely affect the us economy  the global economy and our financial performance 
these include  but are not limited to  periods of slow economic growth or recession  volatility and or lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and or higher cost of borrowing to lowe s and its customers  slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income  sustained high rates of unemployment  unsupportable consumer debt levels  increasing fuel and energy costs  inflation or deflation of commodity prices  natural disasters  acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia  the middle east and other parts of the world 
adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 
sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects 
steep declines over the last four years in home prices  the increasing number of households with little or negative equity  high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates  the reduction in the availability of mortgage financing  slower household formation growth rates  and lower housing turnover through existing home sales  which is a major driver of our business  have limited  and may continue to limit  consumers discretionary spending  particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business 
the large number of borrowers who remain at risk of potentially losing their homes through foreclosures or short sales  coupled with the voluntary and involuntary halts of foreclosure proceedings by lenders due to legal challenges to the adequacy of their documentation and record keeping  could prolong the downturn in the housing and home improvement markets and negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and our comparable store sales 
changes in existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations at the state  federal and international levels change frequently and can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors 
any changes in regulations  the imposition of additional regulations  or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment labor  trade  product safety  transportation logistics  energy costs  health care  tax or environmental issues  could have an adverse impact  directly or indirectly  on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have many competitors  who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising  marketing and distribution strategies effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small  direct and indirect competitors 
the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions  particularly of discretionary items 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores  customer service  quality and price of merchandise and services  in stock levels  and merchandise assortment and presentation 
our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance 
moreover  changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors  including the effects of competitor liquidation activities  may impact our expected results 
if our employees or third party installers and repair technicians are unable to accept and embrace changes in our business model  we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives 
we are adapting our business model to meet our customers changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products they need and want  but also deliver a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish 
our goal is to simplify the complex process of home improvement  provide better project execution than our competitors and generally make the process of doing a small or large home improvement project as seamless as possible 
reaching that goal on a continual basis requires that we deliver a consistent look and feel as our customers interact with lowe s through our stores  our web site  our contact center  our project specialists who meet with them in their homes  our third party installers and repair technicians  and our in home delivery of products they purchase online or in our stores 
this will require new competencies in some positions  and our employees  third party installers  and repair technicians will not only have to understand non traditional selling platforms but also commit to changing how they have traditionally interacted with our customers 
to the extent they are unable or unwilling to embrace and accept these changes in our business model  our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects may not be as successful as we expect them to be 
our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 
part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors 
to better distinguish our product offering  we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names 
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 
expanding internationally presents unique challenges that will require us to adapt our store operations  merchandising  marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 
about one third of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico 
we are also in a joint venture with australia s largest retailer  woolworths limited  to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia 
expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks  and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 
if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame  cost and functionality  our strategic business initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 
the success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them 
the users and the developers of these technology systems share the responsibility for their timely and cost effective delivery as well as their functionality  requiring them to collaborate and cooperate closely with one another 
extended delays or cost overruns in securing  developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now  and will be developing in the future  would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 
our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 
an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment  merchandise ordering  transportation  receipt processing and product delivery 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain  improve  upgrade  and expand our systems 
as customer facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multi channel sales and marketing strategy  the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 
access to the internet from computers  smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them 
our website  lowes 
com is a sales channel for our products  and is also a method of making product  project and other relevant information available to them that influences a large portion of our in store sales 
in addition to lowes 
com  we have multiple affiliated websites through which we seek to inspire  inform  cross sell  establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers 
performance issues with these customer facing technology systems or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers perceptions of lowe s as a reliable source of information about home improvement products and services 
our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer  employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data 
while we have invested heavily in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer  employee and vendor data provided to us  a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial condition 
such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks 
also  the regulatory environment relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data is becoming stricter 
a material failure on our part to comply with these evolving regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 
if we fail to hire  train  manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists  or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians  with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment  we could lose sales to our competitors 
our customers  whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses  expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide 
our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner 
increasingly  our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets  including in some instances the ability to do in home or telephone sales 
in addition  in many of our stores our employees and third party contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 
also  as our employees as a group become increasingly culturally diverse  our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

index failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 
no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than of our total purchases  but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell 
we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business 
if these vendors or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly  our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially  in some cases  permanently 
failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales  profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
product and service quality issues could result in negative impact on customer confidence in lowe s and the company s brand image 
as a result  lowe s reputation as a retailer of high quality products  including both national and lowe s private brands  could suffer 
additionally  a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls  product liability and warranty claims 
if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted  our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 
we source the approximately  products we stock and sell from over  domestic and international vendors 
we source an increasing number of those products directly from foreign manufacturers 
financial instability among key vendors  political instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs
