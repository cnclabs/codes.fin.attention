readers are referred to the cautionary statements and important factors discussed in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  for further information 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following global economic and political instability competition narrow margins dependence on information systems acquisitions and dispositions exposure to natural disasters  war and terrorism dependence on independent shipping companies impact of policy changes labor strikes risk of declines in inventory value product availability vendor terms and conditions loss of significant customers customer credit exposure need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates  exposure to foreign markets international operations changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation potential adverse effects of litigation changes in accounting rules volatility of common stock price overview tech data is the world s second largest wholesale distributor of technology products 
we serve as a strategic link in the technology supply chain by bringing products from the world s leading technology vendors to market  as well as providing our customers with advanced logistics capabilities and value added services 
our customers include value added resellers vars direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers who support the diverse technology needs of end users 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas including north america and south america and europe 

table of contents the company s financial objectives are to grow sales at or above the market  gain share in select markets  improve profitability and generate return on invested capital well above our weighted average cost of capital 
to achieve this  we are focused on a strategy of execution  diversification and innovation that we believe differentiates our business in the marketplace 
the fundamental element of our strategy is superior execution focused on our ability to leverage our efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand  develop markets and cost efficiencies for our vendors and customers 
the technology distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition and declining average selling prices per unit  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our vendors  including those terms related to rebates  price protection  product returns and other incentives 
we expect these conditions to continue in the foreseeable future and  therefore  we will continue to proactively evaluate our pricing policies and inventory management practices in response to potential changes in our vendor terms and conditions and the general market environment 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
at january   we had a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total shareholders equity of 
in addition to focusing on superior execution  we continue to diversify and realign our customer and vendor portfolios to help drive long term profitability throughout our operations 
our broadline distribution business is  and will continue to be  our core business 
however  as technology evolves  our business model and value added offerings will evolve to ensure our vendors have an efficient distribution channel for their products and our customers have a broad array of solutions to sell 
in both europe and the americas  we are continuing to expand our product portfolio to include leading technologies surrounding data center  mobility  consumer electronics and software 
in addition  we have continued to invest in our integrated supply chain offerings designed to provide innovative third party logistics and other services to our business partners 
as we execute our diversification strategy we continuously monitor the extension of credit and other terms and conditions offered to our customers to prudently balance risk  profitability and return on invested capital 
in support of our diversification strategy  during fiscal  we completed the acquisition of triade holding bv triade  a privately held portfolio of leading value added distributors of consumer electronics and information technology products in the benelux region and denmark 
the company believes the acquisition of triade will strengthen the company s presence in benelux  denmark and norway and enables the company to accelerate its diversification strategy into the consumer electronics business in the region  while continuing to leverage the company s existing infrastructure 
in a related transaction  brightstar europe limited bel  our consolidated joint venture with brightstar corporation  acquired triade s mobility subsidiaries in belgium and the netherlands mcc 
the company believes bel s acquisition of mcc significantly extends bel s mobility operations in europe 
during fiscal  we completed four additional acquisitions in europe which further strengthened our european enterprise  broadline and mobility businesses 
while these acquisitions do not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in fiscal  they will further expand our distribution capabilities  broaden our product and customer portfolios and are important additions in their respective markets  while leveraging our existing infrastructure in europe 
the final tenet of our strategy  which has contributed to our improved performance  is innovation 
our it systems and e business tools and programs have provided flexibility and strength in our business model to navigate through changes in market conditions  structural changes in the technology industry and changes that are created by the technology we sell 
as an example  within our software business  we recently introduced our streamone software licensing selector in the united states  which we believe differentiates us in the marketplace by reducing the complexity and costs incurred by our business partners surrounding software licensing throughout the channel 
we believe our strategy of execution  diversification and innovation is differentiating us in the markets we serve and is delivering solid sales growth  expanded operating margins  strong earnings per share growth  and industry leading returns on invested capital 
we are constantly monitoring the factors that we can control  including our net sales growth  management of costs  working capital and capital spending 
we will also continue to evaluate targeted strategic investments across our operations in it enhancements and new business opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  
table of contents and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any  our historical loss experience and the current economic environment 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
conversely  if actual customer performance were to improve to an extent not expected by us  a reduction in allowances may be required which could have a favorable effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
vendor incentives for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded when earned as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the programs 
we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be deemed uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss  if any  is charged to expense in the period identified 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of january  and determined there was no impairment 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units and a market approach  which evaluates comparative market multiples applied to our reporting units businesses to yield a second assumed value of each reporting unit 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an 
table of contents adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
recent accounting pronouncements and legislation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations we do not consider stock based compensation expense in assessing the performance of our operating segments  and therefore the company reports stock based compensation expense separately

there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our net sales in the past three fiscal years 

table of contents the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net sales for each of the three most recent fiscal years net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes consolidated net income net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to shareholders of tech data corporation net sales our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted the year over year net sales comparison by approximately three percentage points 
on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by compared to fiscal and increased by in europe an increase of on a euro basis 
the increase in net sales in both the americas and europe during fiscal was attributable to the robust demand environment in both regions brought about by the improving global economy throughout the fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  the impact of our five acquisitions in europe 
our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  a decrease of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas declined by compared to fiscal and decreased by in europe a decrease of on a euro basis 
the decline in net sales in both the americas and europe during fiscal was attributable to the softened demand environment and related slowdown in technology spending 
the year over year decline was most pronounced during the first semester of fiscal we saw the decline moderate during the third quarter of fiscal and experienced year over year sales growth during our fourth quarter  when we saw the beginning of an economic recovery in many of the markets we operate 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  a slight improvement over the gross margin in fiscal the relative stability in our year over year gross margin is indicative of our disciplined approach to managing our customer and vendor portfolios  as well as our inventory  pricing and freight management practices 
gross margin during fiscal was  a basis point increase from in fiscal the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to strong execution of our inventory  pricing and freight management practices and targeted diversification of our customer and vendor portfolios 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the operating leverage achieved this year as our net sales have increased at a more rapid rate than our operating expenses 
in absolute dollars  sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a during fiscal is primarily attributable to our continued investments to support sales growth and strategic initiatives and operating expenses related to current year acquisitions  partially offset by the impact of weaker foreign currencies 
sg a as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant at in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we were able to maintain our sg a as a percentage of sales consistent with the prior year as we reduced our sg a expenses in absolute dollars  as further discussed below  to help mitigate the effect of the year over year net sales declines discussed above 
in absolute dollars  sg a decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sg a during fiscal is primarily attributable to cost management actions  including adjustments to headcount and the associated reductions in payroll related expenses and the relative strength  on average  of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal compared to fiscal which contributed approximately million of the decrease 
in addition  fiscal sg a included million of 
table of contents consulting and integration costs related to the acquisition of certain assets of nordic based scribona  ab which did not recur during fiscal interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding revolving credit loan balances as compared to fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on revolving credit loans and lower outstanding average debt balances as compared to fiscal during each of the fiscal years  and  interest expense includes non cash interest expense of million related to the million convertible senior debentures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other expense income  net other expense income  net consists primarily of interest income  discounts on the sale of accounts receivable and net foreign currency exchange gains losses on certain financing transactions and the related derivative instruments used to hedge such financing transactions 
other expense income  net  approximated 
million of net expense in fiscal compared to million of income in fiscal the change in other expense income  net  during fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income  resulting from a decrease in the average short term cash investment balances  and greater discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable compared to the prior year 
other expense income  net  decreased to million of income in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is attributable to lower interest rates on short term cash investments and reduced discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in the average short term cash investment balances compared to the same period of the prior year 
discount on sale of accounts receivable totaled million and million  respectively in fiscal and there was no discount on sale of accounts receivable for fiscal as we did not sell accounts receivable during the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the amounts of income tax reserves and valuation allowances during the respective periods 
in fiscal  we also reversed a million deferred tax valuation allowance in a specific european jurisdiction and recorded the amount as an income tax benefit 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to higher taxable income  the relative mix of earnings and losses within certain countries in which we operate and the adjustments to income tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the amounts of income tax reserves and valuation allowances during the respective periods 
the improvement in our results in certain european countries where we have valuation allowances on deferred tax assets contributed to the lower effective tax rate during fiscal as discussed above  in fiscal  we also reversed a million deferred tax valuation allowance in a specific european jurisdiction and recorded the amount as an income tax benefit 
in fiscal  we reversed a net amount of million of income tax reserves primarily due to statute expirations and resolution of income tax examinations 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in the provision for income taxes is primarily due the relative mix of earnings and losses within certain countries in which we operate and the adjustments to income tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above 
to the extent we generate future consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring the valuation allowance  the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets will be reduced  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during fiscal  and  due to the relative mix of earnings or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate such as i losses in tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit  ii earnings in tax jurisdictions where we have previously recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  and iii earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested 
table of contents indefinitely outside the united states 
the effective tax rate was also affected by the reversal of income tax reserves during the fiscal years discussed above 
the overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in these operating jurisdictions 
we monitor the assumptions used in estimating the annual effective tax rate and make adjustments  if required  throughout the year 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in estimating our annual income tax rates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower earnings than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates  changes in the relative mix of taxable income and taxable loss jurisdictions  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or to be required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was million in fiscal  compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of million in fiscal and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of million in fiscal the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest represents brightstar corporation s share of the joint venture income loss  as the joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements 
the year over year changes can be attributed to both the improving results in the joint venture s operations and the acquisition of mcc during the third quarter of fiscal impact of inflation during the fiscal years ended january   and  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our consolidated operations or on our financial position 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter and decreased demand in other fiscal quarters  particularly quarters that include summer months 
given that the majority of our net sales are derived from europe  our consolidated results closely follow the seasonality trends in europe 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and dispositions  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure for all periods presented 
cash flows the following table summarizes tech data s consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   and years ended january  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents as a distribution company  our business requires significant investment in working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventory  partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors 
overall  as our sales volume increases  our net investment in working capital typically increases  which  in general  results in decreased cash flow from operating activities 
conversely  when sales volume decreases  our net investment in working capital typically decreases  which  in general  results in increased cash flow from 
table of contents operating activities 
another important driver to our operating cash flows is our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days 
our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
we manage our cash conversion cycle on a daily basis throughout the year and our reported financial results reflect that cash conversion cycle at the balance sheet date 
our net cash days were days at the end of fiscal  which was an increase over fiscal  yet well within our targeted range 
the following table presents the components of tech data s cash conversion cycle  in days  as of january   and as of january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle days net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal the change in cash resulting from operating activities in fiscal compared to the same period of the prior year can be attributed to i the timing of both cash receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors and ii additional working capital requirements due to the stronger net sales performance in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the economic recovery throughout fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal can be attributed to i our earnings improvement in fiscal  ii the timing of both cash receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors  iii the positive results from our working capital management programs  especially in europe  and iv the reduced working capital requirements resulting from the reduction in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal is the net result of million of cash used for acquisitions in europe and million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers in both the americas and europe 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal for equipment and machinery in our logistics centers  office facilities and it systems 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was the net result of million of proceeds received from the sale of certain facilities in the us and europe  million of cash used for acquisitions in europe and million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal is primarily the result of million of cash used in the repurchase of  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs and million of net repayments on the revolving credit lines and long term debt  partially offset by million of net borrowings and a capital contribution from our joint venture partner related to our consolidated joint venture 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal reflects million in proceeds received for the reissuance of treasury stock related to exercises of equity based incentive awards and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan espp  million of net borrowings from our joint venture partner  partially offset by million of net repayments made on our revolving credit lines and long term debt 
capital resources and debt compliance we have maintained a conservative capital structure and have a debt to capital ratio of at january  we believe this conservative approach to our capital structure served us well during the global economic downturn  and while there are indications that the economy is in the midst of a recovery  there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve 
within our capital structure  we have a range of financing facilities  which are diversified by type and geographic region with various financial institutions worldwide 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balance generally resides in our operations outside of the united states and are deposited and or invested with various financial institutions globally which we monitor regularly for credit quality 
however  we are exposed to risk of loss on funds deposited with the various financial institutions and we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to declare bankruptcy or other similar restructuring 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial 
table of contents and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
convertible senior debentures in december  we issued million of convertible senior debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year 
we pay interest on the debentures on june and december of each year 
in addition  beginning with the period commencing on december  and ending on june  and for each six month period thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for the applicable interest period  if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash at our option at any time on or after december  the convertible senior debentures are convertible into our common stock and cash any time after june   or i if the market price of the common stock  as defined  exceeds of the conversion price per share of common stock  or ii if the company calls the debentures for redemption  or iii upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  as defined 
holders have the right to convert the debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation and shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures in cash on any of the fifth  tenth or fifteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
as a result of this repurchase right  the company has classified the convertible senior debentures as short term debt on the company s consolidated balance sheet at january  the debentures are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
loans payable to brightstar corporation as of january   we have two loans payable to our joint venture partner  brightstar corporation brightstar 
the first loan was executed in october  when brightstar entered into an agreement to loan bel its share of the funding requirements related to bel s acquisition of mcc the acquisition loan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the outstanding balance of the acquisition loan from brightstar  plus any accrued interest  has a repayment date of september  or earlier if agreed between the two parties  and bears interest at the applicable libor rate plus per year  which is payable annually on october the acquisition loan at january  totaled million 
the second loan is an interest free revolving credit loan issued in connection with bel s operations the brightstar revolver 
the terms of the brightstar revolver contain no contractual repayment date and allow the revolving credit loan to increase or decrease in accordance with the working capital requirements of bel  as determined by the company 
the amount outstanding under the brightstar revolver at january  totaled million 
effective october  a resolution of bel s board was approved stating that the brightstar revolver will not be repaid for the foreseeable future and therefore this revolving credit loan has been reclassified as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at january  other facilities as of january   we maintained a receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks which allows us to transfer an undivided interest in a designated pool of us accounts receivable  on an ongoing basis  to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of million  which expires in october we pay interest on the receivables securitization program at the applicable commercial paper or libor rate plus an agreed upon margin 
there were no amounts outstanding under the receivables securitization program at january  or additionally  we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  which expires in march we pay interest under this facility at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
there were no amounts outstanding under the multi currency revolving credit facility at january  or in addition to the facilities described above  we have additional committed and uncommitted lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  to support our operations 
the total capacity of the aforementioned credit facilities  as well as the maximum borrowings allowable under the facility agreements  was approximately million  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit agreements contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit agreements require compliance with certain warranties and covenants 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit agreements include a debt to capitalization ratio  an interest to ebitda as defined per the credit agreements ratio and a tangible net worth requirement 
at january   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit the company s ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
at january   the company had issued standby letters of credit of million for the guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit may reduce the company s available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
share repurchase programs in both july and december  our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
during fiscal  we completed both share repurchase programs  purchasing  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million 
in early march  our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under our share repurchase programs  the number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases is based on working capital 
table of contents requirements  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
shares we repurchase are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under employee equity incentive plans 
contractual obligations as of january   future payments of debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows in thousands operating leases capital lease convertible senior debentures debt total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments amounts include interest on million convertible senior debentures calculated at the fixed rate of per year assuming the convertible senior debentures will be repurchased in december amounts include all debt outstanding at january  under the company s committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities and loan payable and revolving credit loan payable to brightstar corporation and exclude estimated interest as the revolving credit facilities and loans payable are at variable rates of interest or interest free 
fair value renewal and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant  other than the it outsourcing agreement included above  and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
at january   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our liability for uncertain tax position of million has not been included in the contractual obligations table above see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility we have a synthetic lease facility the synthetic lease with a group of financial institutions under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company renewed its existing synthetic lease with a new agreement that expires in june properties leased under the synthetic lease are located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the synthetic lease has been accounted for as an operating lease and rental payments are calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
during the first four years of the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase any combination of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  as long as the lease balance does not decrease below a defined amount 
during the last year of the lease term  until days prior to the lease expiration  we may  at our option  i purchase a minimum of two of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  ii exercise the option to renew the lease for a minimum of two of the seven properties or iii exercise the option to remarket a minimum of two of the seven properties and cause a sale of the properties 
if we elect to 
table of contents remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each property  in the aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
we have also provided a residual value guarantee related to the synthetic lease  which has been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual guarantee 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the synthetic lease is approximately million at january  and such amounts are included in the future minimum lease payments presented above 
the synthetic lease contains covenants that must be complied with  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
guarantees as is customary in the technology industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company related to purchases made from the company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to the above guarantees is remote 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
with respect to our internal netting practices  we will consider inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable in certain circumstances 
this practice offsets such inventory against corresponding accounts payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary buying the inventory  when determining our net exposure to be hedged using traditional forward contracts 
under this strategy  we would expect to increase or decrease our selling prices for product purchased in foreign currencies based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affecting the underlying accounts payable 
to the extent we incur a foreign currency exchange loss gain on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency  we would expect to see a corresponding increase decrease in gross profit as the related inventory is sold 
this strategy can result in a certain degree of quarterly earnings volatility as the underlying accounts payable is remeasured using the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period  or settlement date if earlier  whereas the corresponding increase decrease in gross profit is not realized until the related inventory is sold 
our foreign currency exposure relates to our transactions in europe  canada and latin america  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
during fiscal and  the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  brazilian reais  british pound  canadian dollar  chilean peso  colombian peso  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  mexican peso  norwegian krone  polish zloty  swedish krona and swiss franc 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes through the use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts to primarily hedge loans  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and to finance working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
we utilize various financing instruments  such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities  convertible senior debentures and trade receivable purchase facilities  to finance working capital needs 
to the extent that there are changes in interest rates  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt may fluctuate 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 
table of contents  random market price paths 
the var model determines the potential impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates assuming a one day holding period  normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign exchange and debt portfolio due to adverse movements in the rates 
the model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
firm commitments  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
the following table represents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value at a confidence level  calculated using the var model at january  and we believe that the hypothetical loss in fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives would be offset by the gains in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
var as of january  january  in thousands currency rate sensitive financial instruments interest rate sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio actual future gains and losses associated with the company s derivative positions may differ materially from the analyses performed as of january   due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
