item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of surgical and non surgical products for the spine  orthopedics  sports medicine and other products market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are invasive and minimally invasive spinal implant products and related human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  non invasive bone growth stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include cold therapy  bone cement and devices for removal of bone cement used to fix artificial implants 
our results and financial condition include the following items of significance an increase in revenue driven by the introduction of a number of key new products that were launched in  including the trinity evolution allograft  the firebird pedicle screw system  the pillar sa interbody device  and the ascent le posterior cervical spine system 
an increase in gross profit margin driven by a full year of sales of our key new products indicated above  primarily trinity evolution 
while we record of the sales price of trinity evolution allograft versus recording of the sales price of the previous trinity product  we recognize a gross profit margin from the marketing fees earned from the sales of this allograft  compared to approximately a gross profit margin on our previous trinity product 
this is due to the fact that we are not required to purchase inventory of trinity evolution whereas  previously  we were required to purchase inventory of the previous trinity product and record the associated cost of sales 
the previous trinity product was sold through the end of the second quarter of a decrease in operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  as we continue to leverage our operating infrastructure against the increase in net sales noted above 
in  we initiated a reorganization and consolidation plan to reduce operating expenses by eliminating redundancies and increasing operating efficiency 
this plan included the consolidation of our springfield  ma and wayne  nj locations into our operations in the dallas  tx area 
for a further discussion of this reorganization and consolidation plan  please refer to the explanation provided in our liquidity and capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis 
we have administrative and training facilities in the us and italy and manufacturing facilities in the us  the united kingdom  italy and mexico 
we directly distribute our products in the us  the united kingdom  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  brazil  and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of our company and our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents our reporting currency is the us dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
however  sales associated with products for elective procedures appear to be influenced by the somewhat lower level of such procedures performed in the late summer 
certain of the breg bracing products experience greater demand in the fall and winter corresponding with high school and college football schedules and winter sports 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar denominated income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our operations as four business segments domestic  spinal implants and biologics  breg  and international 
domestic consists of operations of our subsidiary orthofix inc within the united states 
spinal implants and biologics consist of our blackstone subsidiary and its domestic and international operations 
breg consists of breg inc s operations and domestic and international distributors 
international consists of operations which are located in the rest of the world as well as independent export distribution operations 
group activities are comprised of the operating expenses and identifiable assets of orthofix international nv and its nv holding company subsidiary  orthofix holdings  inc beginning january   we began managing our business by our three global business units of spine  orthopedics and sports medicine 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  potential intangible assets and goodwill impairment  income taxes  and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized as income in the period in which title passes and the products are delivered 
revenues exclude any value added or other local taxes  intercompany sales and trade discounts 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
royalty revenues are recognized when the royalty is earned 
for bone growth stimulation and certain bracing products that are prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on or implanted in and accepted by the patient 
for domestic spinal implant and hct p products  revenues are recognized when the product has been utilized and a confirming purchase order has been received from the hospital 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify that title passes on delivery 
revenues for inventory delivered on consignment are recognized as the product is used by the consignee 

table of contents in  we entered into an agreement with the musculoskeletal transplant foundation mtf to develop and commercialize trinity evolution  a stem cell based bone growth biologic matrix 
with the development process completed in  our company and mtf operate under the terms of a separate commercialization agreement 
under the terms of this year agreement  mtf sources the tissue  processes it to create the bone growth matrix  packages and delivers it to the customer in accordance with orders received from us 
we have exclusive global marketing rights for trinity evolution and receive a marketing fee from mtf based on total sales 
this marketing fee is recorded on a net basis within net sales 
we derive a significant amount of revenues in the us from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
certain billings are subject to review by the third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves for excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory adjustments in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment  intangible assets with definite lives  such as our developed technologies and distribution network assets  are tested for impairment if any adverse conditions exist or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
for purposes of the recoverability test  we group our intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows that we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows associated with intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 

table of contents we test goodwill and certain indefinite lived trademarks at least annually for impairment 
we test more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
these indicators include  among others  declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
consistent with prior years  we have identified four reporting units  which are consistent with our reporting segments  domestic  spinal implants and biologics  breg and international see note for additional information 
in performing the annual impairment test  which is performed during the fourth quarter or more frequently when impairment indicators exist  we utilize the two step approach prescribed 
the first step requires a comparison of each reporting unit s carrying value to the fair value of the respective unit see additional discussions below 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million 
no impairments were recorded during and carrying value in order to calculate the respective carrying values  we record goodwill based on the purchase price allocation performed at the time of acquisition 
corporate assets and liabilities that directly relate to a reporting unit s operations are ascribed directly to that reporting unit 
corporate assets and liabilities that are not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  are allocated based on the respective contribution measure of each reporting unit 
fair value the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated  entirely or predominantly  using an income based approach 
this income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow dcf  which estimates after tax cash flows on a debt free basis  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we believe the dcf generally provides the most meaningful fair value as it appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we may consider using a cost approach but generally believe it is not appropriate  given the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units 
in circumstances when the dcf indicator of fair value is not sufficiently conclusive to support the carrying value of a reporting unit  or when other measures provide a more appropriate indicator  we may consider a market approach in our determination of the reporting unit s fair value 
in performing a dcf calculation  we are required to make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
in connection with these estimates  we consider the following the determination of expected cash flows is based on our strategic plans and long range planning forecasts which  to the extent reasonably possible  reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
revenue growth rates represent estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions 
the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on historical margins  the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in the dcf 
this rate reflects our estimates for stable  perpetual growth for each reporting unit 
the discount rates are based on the reporting unit s risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  using assumptions consistent with publicly traded guideline companies operating within the medical device industry as well as our specific risk factors for each reporting unit 

table of contents management utilizes its operational and industry experience to address these assumptions with best estimates 
to corroborate our calculations  we reconciled our total market capitalization value to the collective fair value of the four reporting units 
we believe this analysis  for the current year  provided an implied control premium consistent with the current industry average 
domestic  spinal implants and biologics  and international reporting units consistent with the prior year calculation  the fair value of for these three reporting units has been established entirely using a dcf method 
these dcf results concluded the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying values at december  the methodology used to calculate assumptions in the december  dcf were consistent with that in the prior year 
this approach appropriately considered adjustments for changes in the economic climate 
breg reporting unit the estimated fair value for our breg reporting unit  which accounts for million of goodwill  exceeded the relating carrying value by approximately 
the fair value was estimated entirely using a dcf model 
this compares to the prior year  in which our fair value estimate also considered indications using a market approach 
given the lack of similar circumstances and events  that provided market based indications of fair value in the prior year  we determined a dcf model most appropriately reflected breg s fair value in the current year 
the projected cash flows assume revenue growth  which is consistent with historical activity and reflective of recent investments in the reporting unit 
the dcf model further reflects  what we believe  to be appropriate discount and terminal growth rate assumptions 
while management does not believe the following assumption changes are reasonably likely to apply  for sensitivity purposes we have considered the impact to breg s fair value by increasing the discount rate and reducing the perpetual growth rate by basis points each and reducing revenue growth by 
these sensitivity analyses noted that any individual change to one or another of these assumptions would not have the effect of reducing breg s estimated fair value below its respective carrying value  however  any combination of these changes would reduce breg s estimated fair value below its carrying value 
as a result  if actual operating results and or the underlying assumptions used in the analyses differ from expected  a future impairment charge may be necessary 
in the event that the future operating results of any of our reporting units do not meet our current expectations  we will consider taking other actions as necessary to maximize profitability based upon conditions at the time 
accordingly  the above sensitivity analysis  while a useful tool  should not be used as a sole predictor of potential impairment 
a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time of such an evaluation would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 
derivatives we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange within the consolidated financial statements according to our hedging policy 
under the policy  we may engage in non leveraged transactions involving various financial derivative instruments to manage exposed positions 
the policy requires us to formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction 
for instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  we formally assess both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that is used in the hedging transaction has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item and whether such derivative may be expected to remain effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be effective as a hedge  we will discontinue the related hedge accounting prospectively 
such a determination would be made when the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item  the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 

table of contents we record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s change in fair value ie  gains or losses is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  and subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure is no longer effective 
we utilize a cross currency swap to manage our foreign currency exposure related to a portion of our intercompany receivable of a us dollar functional currency subsidiary that is denominated in euro 
the cross currency swap has been accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with asc topic derivatives and hedging asc topic litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve a substantial number of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
as part of the total blackstone purchase price  approximately million was placed into an escrow account  against which we can make claims for reimbursement for certain defined items relating to the acquisition for which we are indemnified 
we have certain contingencies arising from the acquisition that we expect will be reimbursable from the escrow account should we have to make a payment to a third party  including legal fees incurred related to the matter 
we believe that the amount that we will be required to pay relating to the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account  however  there can be no assurance that the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic income taxes  on january  as such  we determine whether it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of each position 
at december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared with million of unrecognized tax benefits at december  we have accrued interest and penalties of million at both december  and 
table of contents share based compensation we recognize share based compensation in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted is estimated based on a number of factors  including the vesting and expiration terms of the award  historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired  the expected volatility of our common stock and an employee s average length of service 
the risk free interest rate is determined based upon a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the compensation expense recognized for all equity based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures

while we record of the sales price of trinity evolution allograft versus recording of the sales price of the previous trinity product  we recognize a gross profit margin from the marketing fees earned from the sales of this allograft  compared to an approximately gross profit margin on our previous trinity product 
this is due to the fact that we are not required to purchase inventory of trinity evolution whereas  previously  we were required to purchase inventory of the previous trinity product and record the associated cost of sales

as part of our debt refinancing completed in september  five year projections were prepared for blackstone

table of contents we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of sales  costs of operations and the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had a currency swap in place to minimize foreign currency exchange risk related to a million intercompany note 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our term loan facility and revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on libor plus an applicable borrowing margin or at a base rate as defined in the new credit agreement plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   the entire term loan facility of million is at the libor rate plus a margin of 
as of december   million of the revolving credit facility is at the libor rate plus a margin of and the remaining million of the revolving credit facility is at a base rate as defined in the new credit agreement plus a margin of 
these margins are adjusted based upon the measurement of the consolidated leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries with respect to the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters 
as of december   our effective interest rate on our credit facilities was 
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facilities as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the term loan facility and revolving credit facility would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million annually 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we are subject to cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we are subject to transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency 
as of december   we had an un hedged intercompany receivable denominated in euro of approximately million million 
we recorded a foreign currency loss during the year ended december  of million related to this un hedged long term intercompany balance in accumulated other comprehensive income during  which resulted from the weakening of the euro against the us dollar during the period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency loss of million on the statement of operations resulting from gains and losses in foreign currency transactions 
we also are subject to currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably impacted during the year ended december  by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency during this period in certain countries outside of europe  partially offset by the effect of the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was unfavorably impacted during the year ended december  by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the strengthening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency during this period 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results
