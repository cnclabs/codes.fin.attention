through our lillibridge subsidiary  we also managed an additional mobs for third parties as of december  our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives generating consistent  reliable and growing cash flows  maintaining a well diversified portfolio  and preserving our investment grade balance sheet and liquidity 
access to external capital is critical to the success of our strategy as it impacts our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and to make future investments 
our access to and cost of capital depend on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 
generally  we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing 
at december   only of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt 
operating highlights highlights since february  our senior unsecured debt securities have maintained investment grade ratings by all three nationally recognized rating agencies 
during  we received million of additional capital commitments for the portion of indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facilities maturing in we now have billion of aggregate borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities  all of which matures on april  our board of directors declared four quarterly installments of our dividend in the amount of per share  representing a increase over our quarterly dividend 
the quarterly installments of our dividend were paid in cash in march  june  september and december

our portfolio now includes owned or managed mobs comprising million square feet in states and the district of columbia 
in september  we entered into a million three year unsecured term loan with bank of america  na  as lender 
the term loan is non amortizing and bears interest at an all in fixed rate of per annum 
the term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our unsecured revolving credit facilities 
in october  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of privately owned atria senior living group  inc together with its affiliates  atria for a total purchase price of billion  comprised of billion of our common stock a fixed million shares  million in cash and the assumption or repayment of billion of net debt

the noncontrolling interests acquired represented between and ownership interests in the communities  and we now own of all of our seniors housing communities managed by sunrise 
in december  we and sunrise modified the management agreements with respect to each of our sunrise managed seniors housing communities 
among other things  the modifications included reduction of the management fee paid to sunrise for the period from april  through december  and for all of to and per annum  respectively  after which the annual base management fee will equal of revenues with a range of to  a cap on the amount of incentive management fees payable to sunrise and allocated shared services expenses  enhanced rights and remedies for us in the event of a sunrise default  and reallocation of the net operating income noi performance thresholds to include a cushion for all communities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with gaap set forth in the accounting standards codification asc  as published by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base these estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  a different accounting treatment may have been applied  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and in the event they prove to be different from actual results  we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described below  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
we apply fasb guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities vies  which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we must make judgments regarding our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie 
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the entity 
we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis  and our ability to make accurate judgments regarding our influence or control over an entity and to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements 
in the future  our assumptions may change  which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 
long lived assets and intangibles we record investments in real estate assets at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in place leases  acquired lease contracts  tenant and customer relationships  trade names trademarks and goodwill 
our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land and improvements  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place leases  above and or below market leases and any debt assumed 
these estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations  as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
in addition  we amortize the value assigned to above and or below 
table of contents market leases as a component of revenue  unlike in place leases and other intangibles  which we include in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset  on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions 
the fair value of lease intangibles  if any  reflects i the estimated value of any above and or below market leases  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  ii the estimated value of in place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii the estimated value of any above and or below market ground leases  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rental rate and the in place lease rate  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired  if any  by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases  which includes the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
we estimate the value of trade names trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize the resulting intangible over the estimated useful life 
we calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings  which we approximate based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition  and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
we do not amortize goodwill  which is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations  and we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination 
if impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives  we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  then the fair value of the asset is estimated 
we determine the impairment expense by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value and recognize any shortfall from fair value as an expense in the current period 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually  but more frequently if indicators arise 
we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation of goodwill and real estate investments and intangibles are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions  such as revenue and expense growth rates and discount rates 

table of contents business combinations for our acquisitions  we measure the assets acquired  liabilities assumed including contingencies and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date 
our acquisition related transaction costs are included in merger related expenses and deal costs on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and prior to january   these costs were capitalized as part of the asset value at the time of the acquisition  as required by fasb guidance in effect at that time 
loans receivable loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees  purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances 
net deferred origination fees  which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs  and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method 
we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors  including i corporate and facility level financial and operational reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor  iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant  and v current economic conditions 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
we record a reserve at the time it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including the contractual interest and principal payments of the loan 
at the time a reserve is recorded  we typically cease recognizing interest income on the loan 
fair value we follow fasb guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary disclosures 
the guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy 
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access 
level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability 
level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as other observable inputs for the asset or liability  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on the reporting entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
additionally  if an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value 
in addition  if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly  the entity shall place little  if any  weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
we record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale and classify them as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are recorded at fair market value  with 
table of contents unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
we report interest income  including discount or premium amortization  on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold  which are based on the specific identification method  in income from loans and investments on our consolidated statements of income 
we determined the fair value of our current investments in marketable securities using level one inputs 
we determined the valuation allowance for loan losses based on level three inputs 
see note loans receivable of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations are based on level three inputs 
we estimate fair values based on cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information 
we determine impairment in real estate investments  including intangibles and goodwill  utilizing cash flow projections that apply estimated revenue and expense growth rates  discount rates and capitalization rates  which are classified as level three inputs 
we also follow fasb guidance requiring entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security into two components when i there are credit losses associated with the security that management asserts that it does not have an intent to sell and ii it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive loss 
we have not recognized any other than temporary impairments 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  including the majority of our leases with brookdale senior living and the majority of our mob leases  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
we recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured  and in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured  we establish an allowance for estimated losses 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment 
our master lease agreements with kindred the kindred master leases and certain of our other leases provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if such parameters or contingencies are met  rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees  management advisory services and all other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the sec staff accounting bulletin i the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize resident fees and services  other than move in fees  monthly as services are provided 
we recognize move in fees on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement 
lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with days notice 

table of contents federal income tax since we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  we made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of the assets of sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit in april as a result of the sunrise reit acquisition  we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable reit subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the reit provisions 
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  would be included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  would be included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
recently adopted accounting standards on december   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which impacts any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the year had occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period when preparing the pro forma financial information for both the current and prior reporting periods 
the guidance also requires that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative description regarding the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in reported pro forma revenues and earnings 
this guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance on january  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations as of december   we operated through three reportable business segments triple net leased properties  senior living operations and mob operations 
our triple net leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties in the united states and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases  which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
our senior living operations segment primarily consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the united states and canada for which we engage independent third parties  such as sunrise  to manage the operations 
our mob operations segment primarily consists of acquiring  owning  developing  leasing and managing mobs 
with the addition of the lillibridge businesses and properties in july  we believed the segregation of our mob operations into its own reporting segment would be useful in assessing the performance of this portion of our business in the same way that management intends to review our performance and make operating decisions 
prior to the acquisition  we operated through two reportable segments triple net leased properties and senior living operations

revenues related to our triple net leased properties segment consist of fixed rental amounts subject to annual escalations received directly from our tenants based on the terms of the applicable leases and generally do not depend on the operating performance of our properties 
therefore  while occupancy information is relevant to the operations of our tenants  our revenues and financial results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy levels or profits at the triple net leased properties

non gaap financial measures we believe that net income  as defined by gaap  is the most appropriate earnings measurement 
however  we consider certain non gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance 
a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
set forth below are descriptions of the non gaap financial measures we consider relevant to our business and useful to investors  as well as reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures we present herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of our liquidity  nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents funds from operations and normalized funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values  instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider funds from operations ffo and normalized ffo appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity reit 
moreover  we believe that normalized ffo provides useful information because it allows investors  analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items 
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following items which may be recurring in nature a gains and losses on the sales of real property assets  b merger related costs and expenses  including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses  and deal costs and expenses  including expenses and recoveries  if any  relating to our lawsuit against hcp and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees  c the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances  the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees  or additional costs  expenses  discounts  make whole payments  penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt  d the non cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses  e the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures including pursuant to tenant options to purchase and capital transactions  f the reversal or incurrence of contingent liabilities  g gains and losses for non operational foreign currency hedge agreements  and h one time expenses in connection with the kindred rent reset process 
our ffo and normalized ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
the increase in our ffo for the year ended december  over the prior year can be attributed primarily to rental increases from our triple net leased portfolio  higher noi at our senior living operations portfolio due primarily to increased occupancy and higher average daily rates  and higher noi at

we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization including non cash stock based compensation  excluding merger related expenses and deal costs  gains and losses on real estate disposals and asset impairments and or valuation allowances including amounts in discontinued operations 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted

we define noi as total revenues  less interest and other income  property level operating expenses and mob services costs including amounts in discontinued operations

the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

table of contents market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities  certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations  mortgage loans receivable and marketable debt securities 
these market risks result primarily from changes in us or canadian libor rates  the canadian bankers acceptance rate or the us or canadian prime rates 
we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect our fixed rate debt obligations until they mature 
however  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
if interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or is refinanced  our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs 
conversely  lower interest rates at the time of maturity or refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs 
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  in thousands gross book value fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to overall changes in interest rates and a net increase in debt

pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december   interest expense for would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately million  or per diluted common share 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings 
we earn interest from investments in marketable debt securities on a fixed rate basis 
we record these investments as available for sale at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair value of these investments to change 
as of december  and  the fair value of our marketable debt securities  which had an original cost of million and million  respectively  was million and million  respectively 

table of contents as of december   the fair value of our loans receivable was million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans 
see note loans receivable and note fair values of financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we are subject to fluctuations in us and canadian exchange rates which may  from time to time  have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our senior living operations in canada 
based on results  if the canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by  our results from operations would decrease or increase  as applicable  by less than million per year 
if we increase our international presence through investments in  and or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit a material adverse effect 
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to understand the potential risks of economic downturns involving our various asset types  geographic locations or tenants  operators or managers 
we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix 
investment mix measures the portion of our investments related to certain asset types or tenants  operators or managers 
operations mix measures the portion of our operating results attributable to certain tenants  operators or managers or geographic locations 
the following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented december  investment mix by type seniors housing communities skilled nursing facilities mobs hospitals loans receivable  net other properties investment mix by tenant  operator and manager sunrise kindred brookdale senior living ratios are based on the gross book value of real estate investments including assets held for sale as of each reporting date

see non gaap financial measures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional disclosure and reconciliations of adjusted ebitda and noi to our net income  as computed in accordance with gaap 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the consumer price index  with caps  floors or collars 
we also earn revenue from individual residents at our seniors housing communities managed by independent third parties  such as sunrise  and tenants in our mobs 
for the year ended december   of our adjusted ebitda was derived from our senior living operations managed by sunrise and mob operations  where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions 
our reliance on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income creates credit risk 
kindred s and brookdale senior living s financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us have a significant impact on our results of operations 
table of contents and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties  which could have a material adverse effect on us

sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long term management agreements 
each management agreement has a term of years from its effective date  the earliest of which began in pursuant to the management agreements  we pay sunrise a base management fee equal to a specified percentage of resident fees and similar revenues  subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to noi for a pool of properties 
for our sunrise managed communities  we paid management fees of for the period from january  through march  and for the period from april  through december  for  in accordance with the management agreements  as modified in december  we will pay management fees of of resident fees and similar revenues  and thereafter we will pay base management fees of of resident fees and similar revenues with a range of to 
after  we will also be obligated to pay incentive management fees if the properties exceed aggregate performance targets relating to noi  provided  however  that total management fees  including incentive fees  shall not exceed of resident fees and similar revenues 
the management agreements also specify that we will reimburse sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities 
we may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof including  in certain circumstances  the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation  subject in most cases to sunrise s rights to cure such defaults 
each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise 
in addition  the management agreements provide for termination rights if performance falls below specified noi targets or if sunrise fails to comply with certain expense control covenants
