overview quanex outperformed in the face of difficult end markets in fiscal prime window demand dropped to new lows in at an estimated million units 
while the first quarter of experienced demand pull forward in advance of the  window tax credit that expired on december   demand could be characterized as lackluster for the remainder of the fiscal year as the building and construction market did not experience a meaningful spring bounce as is typical as the year progresses 
the figures include financial results from the edgetech acquisition beginning in april net sales increased in by million compared to the same period of last year of which million was driven by the edgetech acquisition 
despite weak end markets  same store revenues from engineered products were slightly higher compared to  supported by price increases and surcharges 
operating income for was million lower than the same period last year due to lower aluminum sheet shipments  higher maintenance costs at aluminum sheet products  coupled with higher costs at engineered products associated with rationalizing operations  incremental sales and marketing costs as the company invested in long term organic growth initiatives  acquisition related costs  higher raw material costs and warranty expense 
housing starts and window shipments have declined significantly in recent years from record highs in of million and million units  respectively  to an estimated million and million  respectively  in the following table sets forth the annual calendar year market information from the peak to the current estimates housing starts window shipments starts millions change shipments millions change e as published by the national association of home builders 
as published by ducker worldwide 
while the condition of the company s primary end markets found new lows  the company continues to demonstrate an ability to outperform the market by developing new products  securing price realization  and from the benefits of longstanding relationships with leading customers who the company believes continued to grow share 
the company took steps in fiscal to invest in the long term growth of the business with the acquisition of edgetech and consolidation of several facilities 
as a direct result of the strengths of edgetech  the company reorganized the sales  marketing  customer service and technical services functions for engineered products into an organization that is best equipped to support our customers and to provide industry leading customer service in addition to allowing for streamlined integration of future acquisitions 
all of these activities contributed costs during the year for which the benefits will be realized in future periods 
aluminum sheet products experienced a drop in demand as customers moved to take out much of the inventory restocking that took place in as the building and construction market failed to bounce in the spring as many had expected 
fiscal showed early signs of a potential recovery with fiscal year housing starts increasing over the company outperformed the market with engineered products increasing sales for the same comparative 
table of contents period 
additionally  the aluminum sheet products business benefited in from inventory re building  industry capacity reductions and market share gains in following a weak all of these factors  coupled with a continuous focus on controllable internal factors and the financial position of the company  resulted in the company not only performing relatively well in difficult times  but positioning it to gain additional market share even as end market conditions remain difficult 
end market conditions in the first half of fiscal year were extremely difficult  driven by the collapse of the housing market along with a collapse of aluminum prices to an inflation adjusted record low 
with markets still depressed  the company saw a sales improvement in the second half of due to a better than expected seasonal pickup in the building season 
despite the difficult economic challenges in and its resulting pressure on sales volume  quanex produced respectable cash generation in  the result of significant improvements in working capital  a focus on cost controls  lean initiatives and price realization 
in  each quarter s sales were higher than the comparative quarter 
the company s net sales increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal quanex continued to not only keep  but win new business on the strength of its value proposition and solid execution 
additionally  the company s focus on price realization and vigilant focus on flexing the operations to demand are evident in its financial results and margins 
the strong performance at the aluminum sheet products segment contributed million to the net sales increase for the year as the segment experienced exceptionally strong shipments complimented by an increase in average selling prices 
the company continues to believe that consumer demand for more energy efficient products and its ability to provide innovative window and door systems  in addition to stand alone components  along with new sales and marketing efforts targeted at national and regional oem customers  will help fuel its long term organic growth even as the housing market continues to experience hardship 
demographics for long term housing demand in the us remain favorable when factoring the projected population increase and continuing immigration 
the company believes taking a disciplined approach to the way it seeks new business opportunities will make it a more successful company and a stronger competitor by offering a broader range of customers a more robust slate of systems  products and services 
additionally  the company is elevating its programs to develop more energy efficient products as well as a strong focus on achieving the highest level of customer service in the industry 
these programs and initiatives  coupled with an eventual return to a more normal housing market  will benefit quanex over the long term 
in addition to the negative impact weaker markets have had on the company s net sales and operating income  the company incurred impairments of its goodwill  and to a lesser extent  its other intangible assets in fiscal of million

quanex has two reportable segments engineered products and aluminum sheet products 
the engineered products segment produces systems  finished products  and components serving the oem residential window and door industry  while the aluminum sheet products segment produces mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader building and construction markets 
the primary market drivers of both segments are residential repair and remodel activity r r and new home construction 

table of contents for financial reporting purposes  four of the company s five operating segments  homeshield  truseal  edgetech and mikron  have been aggregated into the engineered products reportable segment 
the remaining operating segment  aluminum sheet products nichols aluminum  is reported as a separate reportable segment 
corporate other is comprised of corporate office expenses and certain inter division eliminations 
the sale of products between segments is recognized at market prices 
the financial performance of the operations is based upon operating income 
the segments follow the accounting principles described in the summary of significant accounting principles  see item  note the two reportable segments value inventory on a fifo or weighted average basis while the lifo reserve relating to those operations accounted for under the lifo method of inventory valuation is computed on a consolidated basis in a single pool and treated as a corporate item

percentage of change not meaningful 
since quanex s acquisition of edgetech on march   edgetech generated million in net sales and is the primary reason net sales for exceeded the prior year period 
engineered products same store net sales were essentially flat despite difficult end markets 
engineered products compares its sales to us window shipments as reported by ducker worldwide  a market intelligence firm 
for the twelve months ended october   engineered products net sales before contributions from acquisitions were up compared to the previous twelve months  versus us window shipments that were down approximately 
the company s engineered products business outperformed the market in fiscal with net sales up in comparatively  the company s market drivers were essentially flat at an estimated increase on a combined basis in fiscal compared to fiscal the engineered products business experienced healthy growth  especially from r r activity  market share gains by customers and new products 
the growth this year further illustrates the logic of the segment s continued emphasis to gain share in the more active residential r r market 
the company continues to keep and win new business on the strength of the value proposition of its highly engineered window and door products 
the company believes that programs like the expired  first time homebuyers tax credit  the  tax credit for energy efficient windows  which expired at the end of december  and customer restocking in the first half of the year benefited results in as anticipated by the company  its demand slowed mid way through  which reflected the residential building and construction market peaking earlier in than is typical 
net sales less cost of sales contribution margin at engineered products for compared to the same period of last year improved by million including edgetech s contribution of million 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the year ended october  are slightly below the same period due to higher raw material costs and temporary increases in labor expense as the company used overtime to meet a hike in orders in november and december  additionally  the first fiscal quarter of benefited from calculated using data from external sources national association of home builders nahb for new home starts and harvard university s joint center for housing studies for repair and remodeling expenditures 

table of contents hourly labor savings associated with the strike at the segment s barbourville  kentucky facility in mid december although engineered products experienced higher raw material costs in  these higher costs were generally offset by higher prices  surcharges  cost controls and productivity improvements  which strengthened margins 
truseal  one of the company s warm edge  insulating glass spacer divisions  initiated an oil based raw material surcharge effective may  the surcharge helped truseal offset the rising cost of butyl  a key raw material of the business and highly correlated to the price of oil 
further reducing margins during was million of costs associated with plant consolidations and closings as the company rationalized production facilities 
the company finished the building consolidation project at its facility in kent  washington where four buildings have been consolidated to one  and the company closed a facility in the dalles  oregon 
of the million in plant consolidation costs  million is recognized in cost of sales 
during  million of expense was recognized in cost of sales to increase the warranty reserve associated with a discontinued legacy product and claims from some years ago 
because the establishment of the warranty reserve is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of the number of future claims and the cost to settle claims  the company s ultimate losses may differ from the warranty reserve and future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary 
finally  results were negatively impacted by million of additional non cash cost of goods sold during  due to the increased value of inventory sold from applying purchase accounting to the edgetech inventory acquired 
of the initial million increase in inventory value from applying purchase accounting  the company expects the remaining million balance to be recognized in net sales less cost of sales for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million or due to increased volume and higher average selling prices 
the company took the necessary actions to right size its business by reducing variable and fixed costs and continuously sizes its operations to match demand 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from fiscal to fiscal as a direct result of the company s right sizing efforts and price realization 
in the first fiscal quarter of  the company had hourly labor savings associated with the strike at the segment s barbourville  kentucky facility in mid december as the then effective labor contract expired without the parties having reached a new agreement 
in january  the strike ended upon ratification of a new three year collective bargaining agreement 
the barbourville facility was able to continue production with the company s non union salaried workforce and continued to deliver its products during the strike to meet customer demands 
benefiting the comparative and results is an expense of million recorded in fiscal related to a truseal warranty reserve increase driven by an increase in a legacy product s claims experience 
reducing margins in fiscal were costs associated with vacating a couple of buildings at the company s mikron facility in kent  washington and higher material costs at truseal 
at truseal  the business uses an oil based butyl compound in its insulating glass sealant systems  and with the rise in oil prices  margins were squeezed in in response  truseal announced a price increase effective november  selling  general and administrative costs increased for the year from the acquisition of edgetech which reported million of selling  general and administrative costs for additionally  the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for the year were attributable to million included in the total million discussed above of costs associated with the aforementioned plant consolidations and closing during the first fiscal quarter of the majority of the million represents an estimated liability to terminate a facility operating lease  this estimated liability is net of an associated sublease benefit 
furthermore  engineered products incurred additional sales and marketing expenses of million in associated with the roll out of new products and programs and increasing resources necessary to achieve long term organic growth  with a focus on expanding further into the regional segment of the residential market 
benefiting the comparative results is million of costs associated with the aforementioned strike in mid december partially offset by the direct labor savings in cost of sales as well as reduced incentives corresponding to lower earnings 
the million or increase in selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially attributable to million of costs associated with the aforementioned strike in mid december partially offset by the direct labor savings in cost of sales 
also  variable pay incentives increased in corresponding to an increased level of earnings 
furthermore  the company began to incur additional sales and marketing expenses associated with the roll out of new products and programs in this 
table of contents increase was partially offset by cost control efforts put in place in and the absence of matching contributions to the quanex building products salaried and non union employee k plan in the first quarter as that program was suspended as of april  the matching contributions on this k plan were reinstated effective february  the company recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge on its barbourville  kentucky real property during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to its plan to consolidate its insulating glass operations 
see further discussion of this topic below 
the million non cash impairment charge reflected in represents million of impairment on acquired intangible assets and million of impairment charge on goodwill 
for additional information on the intangible impairment charges see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
depreciation and amortization has increased in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of edgetech on march  depreciation and amortization associated with edgetech was million seven months for fiscal in addition  depreciation and amortization increased for the year in by million included in the total million discussed above for accelerated depreciation related to the plant consolidations 
depreciation and amortization for the full fiscal year of is expected to increase over fiscal due to a full twelve months of expense from the edgetech acquisition being realized going forward 
depreciation and amortization declined from to due to the aforementioned intangible asset impairment other than goodwill in the first fiscal quarter of additionally  depreciation declined in compared to due to the completion of depreciation on assets acquired in an acquisition in a previous year 
operating income for fiscal was down by million of which million is attributable to the edgetech operating loss since acquisition in operating income for the remaining engineered products businesses for fiscal was below prior year levels primarily due to weak end markets and rising material costs as well as negative impacts from current year costs to consolidate facilities  warranty expense associated with legacy products and incremental sales and marketing investment to support engineered products organic growth initiatives 
the fiscal edgetech operating loss was driven by production start up costs at its germany facility as well as inventory step up expenses from acquisition accounting 
operating income for fiscal was higher than fiscal primarily due to the absence of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge recognized in as well as higher volumes  increases in average selling prices and right sizing efforts 
engineered products long term organic growth programs are focused on driving profitable growth through one sales and marketing team  coupled with the engineering collaboration of its family of businesses mikron  truseal and homeshield and as of march   edgetech 
the company believes these programs will drive profitable growth at engineered products by furthering the goal of becoming the leading energy efficient expert in the market by offering customers state of the art engineering  design and marketing support 
the organic growth programs were formalized and launched in march and are comprised of related initiatives to execute this strategy  the sales  marketing and engineering efforts of these divisions operated independently in the past 
today  engineered products sales and marketing employees have been organized into a single team to better utilize their combined capabilities to expand sales opportunities to the existing customer base 
additionally  the new sales and marketing structure is focused on developing and capturing more mid sized regional oem business 
mid sized regional oems  a customer class engineered products has historically underserved  are believed to comprise about of the market 
the engineering resources across engineered products are also working together to develop products and systems that provide customers with the latest innovations in technology and energy efficiency 
engineered products is in the early stages of this long term organic growth initiative but believes it will have a meaningful impact on its long term growth and profitability 
the company will continue to incur expenses and to invest in additional resources at engineered products to support this organic growth effort 
in addition to the long term organic growth programs  engineered products management also plans to foster operational synergies among existing plants 
in november  management committed to a plan to consolidate its truseal and us edgetech warm edge spacer operations 
the consolidation plan  in part  calls for the 
table of contents permanent closing of its manufacturing facility in barbourville  kentucky 
the company will incur various costs and future expenditures associated with the consolidation  including but not limited to termination costs and asset relocation costs 
the equipment used to manufacture the single seal spacer system will be relocated to the company s cambridge  ohio facility 
the company believes this consolidation will also allow it to better serve customers through streamlined operations 
the consolidation of operations and the subsequent closure of the barbourville facility are expected to be completed in under asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  the company is required to record charges for contractual termination benefits when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits under the contract s terms and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
under asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  the company is required to record charges for one time employee termination benefits  contract termination costs  and other associated costs as incurred 
no exit costs or termination benefits were incurred as of october   and as such no liability has been accrued for the barbourville closing as of october  while discussions with the plant s employee union are in process the total expense expected to be incurred in connection with the closure of barbourville is million over the next months  based upon management s best estimate of future events 
of the estimated charges  approximately is related to relocating and starting up the equipment in cambridge and approximately is associated with salaried and hourly employee termination related costs 
in addition  management estimates spending of approximately million to prepare the cambridge  ohio facility for the new operations activity  of which approximately is expected to be capitalized and approximately expensed 
changes to management s estimates may occur 
the costs related to the closure  severance and relocation activities will be recorded as incurred  when they meet the definition of a liability  and they will be included in the statements of operations as selling  general  and administrative expenses or as cost of sales  in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance

the aluminum association  which tracks aluminum industry shipments of sheet products  reported non can sheet aluminum shipments for year to date october up from a year ago  while aluminum sheet products shipments were down 
part of the company s underperformance versus the industry can be attributed to relatively weaker building and construction demand  where nichols has a sizable presence  compared to stronger distribution and transportation demand  where nichols has a relatively smaller presence 
this decrease in net sales at the aluminum sheet products segment for was partially offset by a increase in average selling price per pound compared

operating income decreased at the aluminum sheet products segment for  compared to prior year due to lower shipped pounds and to a lesser extent lower painted sales 
the aluminum sheet products segment is a high fixed cost business  so as shipments drop due to weaker demand  its ability to substantially reduce operating costs is limited 
operating income was further impacted by high repair and maintenance expenses and to a lesser extent by higher energy costs and higher freight costs 
repair and maintenance expense in increased by million over the same period in part due to projects that were previously deferred in prior years 
the company believes that repairs and maintenance will not remain at levels  and expects future repair and maintenance expenditures to be more in line with this decline in operating income was partially offset by an increase in spread sales price less material costs 
the higher spread compared to the previous year was primarily a result of higher aluminum prices that rose faster than material costs 
the segment s operating income and margins are impacted by changes in lme aluminum prices as its spread is correlated with aluminum prices over time
