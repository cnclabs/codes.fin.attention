item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pt annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
pt future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond pt control 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other factors  business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  inability to gauge order flows from customers  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  errors or defects in our products  the effects of pending or threatened litigation  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to investments  foreign regulations  and potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  during weak or uncertain economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of their orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of pt actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
management s judgment in making these estimates and relying on these assumptions may materially impact amounts reported for any period 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition software development costs valuation of inventories income taxes product warranty stock based compensation restructuring costs investments carrying value of long lived assets revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfied 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  pt allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
anticipated losses on contracts  if any  are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  revenue recognition is deferred and revenue will be recognized when all obligations under the arrangement are fulfilled 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are charged to expense as research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  using the straight line method or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the accounting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product life cycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product life cycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product life cycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes pt provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made 
pt operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of pt 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
in addition  the calculation of pt s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
pt recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires pt to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires pt to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
pt re evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
finally  the value of pt s deferred tax assets is dependent upon pt s ability to generate future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which pt operates 
these assets consist of research credit carry forwards  capital and net operating loss carry forwards  and the future tax effect of temporary differences between balances recorded for financial statement purposes and for tax return purposes 
it will require future pre tax earnings of in excess of million in order to fully realize the value of the company deferred tax assets 
due to the uncertainty of pt s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been recorded against substantially the full value of its deferred tax assets 
product warranty warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of pt s products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
stock based compensation pt s board of directors approves grants of stock options to employees to purchase our common stock 
stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 
restructuring costs restructuring costs generally consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified  or if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimates depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
investments we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price if available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and the underlying collateral  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the extent to which the investment is guaranteed  the financial health of the guarantor if any  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until maturity or for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it were judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued as the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected as an adjustment to net income 
such adjustments could materially adversely affect our operating results 
carrying value of long lived assets pt periodically reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  other than capitalized software development costs and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
pt assesses the recoverability of the carrying values of long lived assets by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
pt estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  pt records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pt determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets is considered a critical accounting estimate because pt s impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including revenue growth rates  expense levels  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact estimated future cash flows and the estimated fair value of long lived assets 
key performance indicators pt believes that a key indicator for its business is the trend for the volume of orders received from customers 
during weak economic periods  customers ability to forecast their requirements deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
forward looking visibility on customer orders continues to be very low 
most of our oem customers are placing orders for product only when they have orders in hand from their customers 
total shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in this significant decrease in revenue was attributable to weak demand from most of pt s traditional oem telecommunications and signaling products customers and to sharply lower shipments of products to one of the company s traditionally two largest customers  alcatel lucent 
overview performance technologies  incorporated pt  a delaware corporation founded in  is a global supplier of advanced network communications solutions to carrier  government and oem markets 
pt s product portfolio includes ip centric network elements and applications designed for high availability  scalability  and long life cycle deployments 
the company s entire line of offerings is anchored by ipnexus  pt s own ip native  highly integrated platforms and element management systems 
oems and application developers  including pt itself  leverage the robust carrier grade linux development environment and rich suite of communications protocols nexusware of ipnexus application ready systems as a cornerstone component of their end product value proposition 
pt s segway signaling solutions provide low cost  high density signaling  advanced routing  ip migration  gateway capabilities  sip bridging  and core to edge distributed intelligence 
in january  pt expanded its signaling product portfolio with the acquisition of genband s universal signaling platform usp and sp signaling technology 
the company s xpress sip based applications enable evolving mobile  multi media  and ims based revenue generating services 
pt s business addresses one industry segment communications  and globally targets two primary vertical markets for its network communications products telecommunications  and military  aerospace and government systems 
the telecommunications market  historically our largest vertical market  is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our ipnexus application ready systems products  which are sold to oems  depend primarily on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
for  the new norm in our oem business appears to be that oem customers place orders for product only when they have orders in hand from their customers and expect almost immediate delivery 
telecommunications market revenues generated from end user solutions  such as our segway and xpress product lines  result from investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands such as text messaging and the transition to internet based communications networks 
during  the economy recovered unevenly around the world and business conditions continued to remain very challenging in the telecommunications equipment market 
sales into the military  aerospace and government systems market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
the opportunity for government funded network infrastructure and military related expenditures remains positive but the timing of awarded business for the most part is highly unpredictable 
our xpress product line is generating interest from both telecommunications and government customers 
during the third quarter  pt began a pilot program with a government customer to demonstrate the xpress products capabilities in a communications cost reduction program 
forward looking visibility on customer orders continues to be at record low levels 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  markets and economic environment 
strategy the company strategy is to maximize the value proposition of its products by leveraging its field proven systems  software and hardware technologies 
management believes the tightly integrated combination of these technologies results in considerable benefits to its customers including a compelling return on investment proposition  significant development risk mitigation and a substantially accelerated time to market opportunity 
early in  management outlined a multi year strategic plan for the company 
this plan encompassed four specific initiatives to construct a solid foundation for long term growth 
these initiatives include further strengthening our segway signaling systems product line  continued evolution and enhancement of our ipnexus application ready systems for mission critical communications applications  intensifying our market diversification efforts in government systems and defense markets  and identifying forward looking network communications growth opportunities  such as our xpress product portfolio of sip based applications and enabling infrastructure  that we can pursue with our own end product solutions 
in the fourth quarter  management proactively undertook several new investments to further position pt for growth as business conditions improve 
the timing of this decision was based upon forward looking market data that we expected would drive opportunities for our technologies 
at a high level  a sampling of these market indicators included forecasted mobile handset growth in  wireless growth opportunities in emerging markets and increasing government driven communications infrastructure expenditures 
these investments included hiring additional direct sales people to bolster our sales organization  the addition of several positions to our research and development team and the expansion of our product management team 
management strongly believed these investments were needed to further position pt for growth as business conditions improve 
during the second half of  it became apparent that the economic and industry trends that occurred did not drive growth for pt s products to the degree expected 
therefore  in december  pt announced an expense reduction program to substantially reduce its operating expenses while retaining the resources necessary to meet our ongoing customer commitments  continue to strengthen our product offerings and continue to deliver excellence in customer support 
management believes that while it was necessary to make these reductions for financial reasons  the significant strategic investments made during were important in underpinning a solid foundation for long term future growth 
further expense reductions may be necessary in if pt s revenue does not increase as expected 
there are significant risks associated with pt s strategy in the current economic climate 
while management believes that its network communications market focus offers opportunities for growth in the long term  network infrastructure investments by carriers are very sluggish  the market for certain signaling products is declining and the market for sip based products is not growing rapidly enough to offset these declines 
based on the current economic environment  which may involve new risks not currently identifiable  management believes that realizing meaningful profitability in the near term is likely to be very difficult 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
financial overview revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in due to the global economic recession  pt has experienced weak demand for its products from its telecommunications customers as end users continue to restrict capital expenditure budgets 
shipments to pt s two traditionally largest customers  metaswitch networks and alcatel lucent  increased million in over  to million 
this million increase includes a million increase in sales to metaswitch networks and a million decrease in sales to alcatel lucent 
shipments to customers outside of the united states represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the increase in shipments to customers outside of the united states was principally due to a rebound in shipments to metaswitch networks and revenue from the company s first segway signaling sales to telecommunications carriers in africa 
shipments to customers in the united states declined by million  due primarily to a decrease in sales to alcatel lucent and lower sales of signaling products 
shipments to the united kingdom represented and of pt s total sales in and  respectively 
earnings pt incurred a net loss in amounting to million  or per basic share  based on million shares outstanding 
this loss included restructuring charges of 
per share  write offs of software development costs of 
per share  stock based compensation expense of 
per share  and discrete income tax provision items totaling 
per share 
pt incurred a net loss for amounting to million  or 
per basic share  based on million shares outstanding 
this loss included a non cash goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge of 
per share  a non cash income tax charge against deferred tax assets amounting to 
per share  restructuring charges of 
per share  discrete income tax benefits of 
per share  and stock based compensation expense of 
per share 
cash cash  cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and the company had no long term debt at either date 
the decrease in cash in was due primarily to cash used in operations of million  capitalized software development costs of million  signaling technology acquisitions of 
million  and purchases of property  equipment and improvements of million 
cash used by operating activities amounted to million and 
million in and  respectively 
the amount included net loss of million  offset by non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  write offs and impairments totaling million and stock based compensation expense of 
million 
in addition  inventories increased by million  offset substantially by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in accounts receivable was principally due to lower fourth quarter sales in  compared to the increase in inventory is primarily attributable to transitioning the company s printed circuit board manufacturing operations to a contract manufacturer  end of life product builds completed prior to that transition and the non achievement of forecasted sales volumes and corresponding inventory build required to meet those forecasted volumes 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to the inventory build and corresponding significant amounts owing to the company s contract manufacturer 
the longer lead times of a contract manufacturing model are necessitating a build up of semi finished goods inventory in order to meet forecasted customer demand 
as a result  the company expects there will be an additional increase in inventory during the first quarter restructuring activities pt implemented two restructuring actions during in december  pt announced its decision to outsource the manufacturing of the printed circuit board assembly for pt s hardware products 
in connection with this decision  the company reduced its rochester workforce by fourteen employees 
total restructuring charges associated with this action were 
million in  of which 
million required an outlay of cash during in december  the company announced its plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the continuing challenges of the global economic environment 
this program  which is projected to be completed by the end of the first quarter  is expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately million to million on an annualized run rate basis 
it includes closing the san luis obispo california engineering facility and the elimination of approximately positions which represents of the company s workforce 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of and expects to record a pre tax charge of 
million during for severance and other costs related to this program 
these costs are expected to require an outlay of cash of 
million and 
million during the first and second quarters of  respectively 
pt implemented two restructuring actions during in january  the company implemented a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the challenging global economic environment 
as a result of this action  the company eliminated twenty positions in the first quarter  or approximately of its global workforce 
in the first quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
in july  the company implemented a voluntary separation program in which substantially all us employees were offered the opportunity to elect termination of employment  subject to the company s approval 
eight employees were voluntarily terminated under this program 
in the third quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales  which has been included as an aid to understanding pt s results and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

total revenue for amounted to million  compared to million for historically  pt s products have been grouped into three distinct categories in one market segment communications products  computing products and switching products 
however  we are no longer reporting revenue based on these product lines as such presentation is no longer meaningful in the context of how management views our business 
rather  management is focused on selling pt s products into two primary vertical markets within one segment  communications 
revenue from each product category is expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated telecommunications military  aerospace and government systems total telecommunications products telecommunications products are comprised of ipnexus application ready systems  segway signaling systems and xpress products 
pt s ipnexus application ready systems are designed for high availability  scalability  and long life cycle deployments and are sold to telecommunication equipment manufacturers 
the company s segway signaling products  which are built on our ipnexus systems  provide a full suite of signaling solutions that seamlessly bridge between circuit switched networks and growing ip based networks 
pt s xpress products are a portfolio of sip based applications and enabling infrastructure for next generation network ngn architectures 
revenue from telecommunications products amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease in revenue of million  or  reflects the impact of the economy on the telecommunications industry  partially offset by a rebound in sales to the company s largest customer  metaswitch networks  as metaswitch sales increased million year over year 
military  aerospace and government products our recently realigned government systems group continues to work with numerous prime contractors to incorporate pt cots based  application ready systems into specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
revenue from military  aerospace and government system products was essentially unchanged in over pt had significant sales to raytheon  the company s second largest customer in  as well as the faa and the us military in gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  and expenses associated with engineering contracts and the technical support function  and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
gross margin was and of sales for and  respectively 
of this decrease  resulted from charges totaling 
million to write off or write down to estimated net realizable value software development costs which were capitalized for new products which either had not reached commercial general release and were discontinued  or which have been released but for which the revenue is not expected to be sufficient to absorb the project s unamortized cost 
in addition  the significant decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales in resulted from a less favorable product sales mix  the non absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  which resulted from significantly lower sales and production volumes  and redundant costs resulting from the transition of the company s printed circuit board assembly operation to a contract manufacturer 
also included in cost of goods sold is the amortization of software development costs which totaled million and million in and  respectively  excluding the 
million of charges for the write down of capitalized software development projects discussed above 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including restructuring expenses of million  and stock compensation expense of 
million 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including impairment charges recorded against goodwill and long lived assets which totaled million  restructuring expenses of 
million  and stock compensation expense of 
million 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
this increase of million  or  was primarily the result of hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  engaging independent sales representatives  increased trade show spending  higher expenses associated with the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and canadian dollar  offset partially by lower commissions 
research and development expenses amounted to million in both and the company capitalizes certain software development costs  which reduces the amount charged to research and development expenses 
amounts capitalized were million in both and gross research and development expenditures were million in both and benefited as a result of the full effect of workforce reductions  offset by higher expenses associated with the foreign currency exchange rate between the united states dollar and canadian dollar in compared to  and a 
million reduction in the savings realized from the company s canadian dollar hedging strategy 
general and administrative expenses totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in expenses was primarily related to significantly higher legal expenses associated with the company s defense of intellectual property litigation instituted by one of the company s competitors 
restructuring charges amounted to million and 
million in and  respectively 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges related to two programs 
in december  the company announced its decision to outsource its printed circuit board assembly operation to a contract manufacturer 
this action resulted in the elimination of fourteen positions during  for which a restructuring charge of 
million was recorded 
in december  the company announced a reduction in force  which will be substantially completed during the first quarter of a restructuring charge of 
million was recorded in in connection with this action 
restructuring charges amounted to 
million in and relate to two reductions in force that management initiated during the year 
in january  twenty positions were eliminated in an involuntary reduction in force  while in august  eight positions were eliminated in a voluntary reduction in force 
both of these actions were completed in a summary of the activity with respect to the and restructuring activity is as follows amounts in millions number lease of severance commitments employees reserve and other total balance at january  restructuring charges

carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
due to the company s decreased stock price during the second half of and resulting lower market capitalization  particularly in comparison with the recovery in united states equity markets  management recorded an impairment charge amounting to million against the full recorded value of goodwill based on the company s assessment at december  in conjunction with the review for impairment of goodwill at december   pt also performed a review of the recoverability of its other long lived assets 
as a result  pt recorded a non cash impairment charge against the carrying value of property  equipment and improvements amounting to 
million 
other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income and totaled 
million in  compared to 
million in this decrease was due to depressed yields the company is earning on its investments and lower average cash and investment balances in than in as of december   the company s funds are primarily invested in government backed money market funds  certificates of deposit  government or government backed bonds of short duration and high quality corporate bonds of short duration 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate is a combination of federal  state and foreign tax rates and is generally lower than statutory rates because it includes benefits derived from tax credits related to research and development activities in the united states and canada  and tax exempt interest income 
for  the income tax provision amounted to 
million and includes the effect of a discrete foreign deferred tax provision of 
million resulting from the company reverting to a partial assertion that the earnings in its canadian subsidiary will be indefinitely reinvested 
the provision also includes a discrete income tax provision of 
million which was recorded due to the income tax benefit which resulted from the decrease in unrealized gain on foreign currency hedge contracts during  and state and foreign taxes  offset by refundable us federal and province of ontario credits 
for  the income tax provision amounted to million  which included state and foreign taxes of 
million and a valuation allowance recorded against the balance of the company s united states deferred tax assets in the amount of million  offset by discrete income tax benefits of 
million  the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to a united states tax law change in november of 
million  and the reversal of the deferred tax liability relating to the company s full impairment of goodwill which amounted to 
million 
stock compensation expense 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses include stock compensation expense which totaled

year ended december  compared with the year ended december  sales 
total revenue for amounted to million  compared to million for historically  pt s products have been grouped into three distinct categories in one market segment communications products  computing products and switching products 
however  we are no longer reporting revenue based on these product lines as such presentation is no longer meaningful in the context of how management views our business 
rather  management is focused on selling pt s products into two primary vertical markets within one segment  communications 
revenue from each product category is expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated telecommunications military  aerospace and government systems total telecommunications products revenue from telecommunications products amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease in revenue of million  or  reflected pervasive soft product demand resulting from the global economic recession  as pt experienced decreases in each product line 
sales of computing products to metaswitch networks declined million  while sales to alcatel lucent declined million 
also contributing to the decrease in telecommunications sales were significant decreases in network access products 
the only product line that did not experience a significant sales decline was in segway signaling products 
military  aerospace and government systems products sales of military  aerospace and government systems products increased by 
million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of total sales  however  this product line increased from to 
significant shipments to raytheon  a prime government contractor  were the most significant factor driving the sales increase 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  and expenses associated with engineering contracts and the technical support function  and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
gross margin was and of sales for and  respectively 
despite improved product mix  gross margin as a percentage of sales fell in due primarily to the non absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  which resulted from significantly lower sales and production volumes 
also included in cost of goods sold is the amortization of software development costs which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in  charges amounting to 
million were recorded to write off certain software development costs relating to new products which had not reached commercial general release and were discontinued 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including impairment charges recorded against goodwill and long lived assets which totaled million  restructuring expenses of 
million  and stock compensation expense of 
million 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including expenses associated with an unsuccessful acquisition of 
million and stock compensation expense amounting to 
million 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease of million  or  was primarily the result of the reduction in force of two salaried employees  lower commissions  reduced travel expenses  and carefully controlled discretionary expenditures 
research and development expenses amounted to million and million in and  respectively the company capitalizes certain software development costs  which reduces the amount charged to research and development expenses
