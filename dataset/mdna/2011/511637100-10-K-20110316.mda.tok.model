significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  lakeland nj investment corp  lakeland investment corp  lakeland equity  inc  and lakeland preferred equity  inc all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
lakeland preferred equity  inc is a real estate investment trust formed by lakeland in the fourth quarter of the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of the company s securities portfolio  the realizability of the 
table of contents company s deferred tax asset and the analysis of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan and lease totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans and leases  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan and lease portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans and leases  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also analyzes historical losses by loan and lease category  and considers the resulting loss rates when determining the reserves on current loan and lease total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans and leases are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan and lease losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
loans and leases are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that lakeland will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled principal and interest payments 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
most of lakeland s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
lakeland groups impaired commercial loans under  into a homogeneous pool and collectively evaluates them 
interest received on impaired loans and leases may be recorded as interest income 
however  if management is not reasonably certain that an impaired loan and lease will be repaid in full  or if a specific time frame to resolve full collection cannot yet be reasonably determined  all payments received are recorded as reductions of principal 
fair values of financial instruments are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost  and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
often  the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax 
table of contents bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan costs  deferred compensation and valuation reserves on leases held for sale 
the company evaluates tax positions that may be uncertain using a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
additional information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions is set forth in note to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of november or when circumstances indicate a potential for impairment at the reporting unit level 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared to the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill the step one test 
the company has determined that it has one reporting unit  community banking 
the company determined that the income approach and the market approach were most appropriate in determining if a step two test for impairment was necessary 
the income approach uses a dividend discount analysis 
this approach calculates cash flows to a potential acquirer based on the anticipated financial results assuming a change of control transaction 
this change of control assumes that an acquirer will achieve an expected base level of earnings  achieve integration cost savings and incur certain transaction costs such as legal and financial adviser fees  contract cancellations  severance and employment obligations  and other transaction costs 
the analysis then calculates the present value of all excess cash flows generated by the company above the minimum tangible capital ratio plus the present value of a terminal sale value 
the market approach is used to calculate the fair value of a company by calculating median price multiples in recent actual acquisitions of companies of similar size and then applying these multiples to a company 
this technique uses historical data to create a current pricing level and is thus a trailing indicator 
results of the selected transaction approach need to be understood in this context  especially in periods of rapid price change and market uncertainty 
also included in the analysis was a premium to market approach which calculates the change of control price a market participant would pay for a company by adding a change of control premium to the trading value of a company 
the analysis also considered a change of control premium to peer market price approach which substitutes trading values from a group of peer companies for the trading values of the parent company 
based on this analysis  as well as a third party valuation as of november   there was no indication that the company s goodwill was impaired as of december   and a step two test was not required 
financial overview the year ended december  represented a year of continued growth for the company

table of contents the following table shows the percentage distributions of loans and leases by category as of december for each of the last five years december  commercial  secured by real estate commercial  industrial  and other leases  including leases held for sale real estate residential mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer at december   there were no concentrations of loans or leases exceeding of total loans and leases outstanding other than loans that are secured by real estate 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity date within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands types of loans commercial  secured by real estate commercial  industrial and other real estate construction total amount of such loans with predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total risk elements commercial loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest have been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced  except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
as a general rule  a non accrual asset may be restored to accrual status when none of its principal or interest is due and unpaid  satisfactory payments have been received for a sustained period usually six months  or when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of collection 

table of contents the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding lakeland s non accrual and past due loans and leases and other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of december  for each of the last five years at december  dollars in thousands commercial  secured by real estate commercial  industrial  and other leases  including leases held for sale real estate residential mortgage home equity and consumer total non accrual loans and leases other real estate and other repossessed assets total non performing assets non performing assets as a percent of total assets loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing troubled debt restructurings  still accruing non accrual loans and leases increased to million on december  from million at december  the change in non accrual loans and leases from to included an increase in residential mortgages and leasing non accruals of million and million  respectively  which was partially offset by a decline in commercial non accruals of million 
non accrual leases include million in net receivables related to one lessee who has named the company and other unrelated parties in a complaint in connection with the leases 
for more information  see legal proceedings in item of part i of this annual report on form k 
the increase in residential mortgages on non accrual resulted from a deterioration in the economy and the continuing high unemployment rate in the company s market area 
commercial loan non accruals included five loan relationships between  and million totaling million  and four loan relationships exceeding million totaling million 
the largest of the commercial loan non accrual loans was million 
all non accrual loans and leases are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout 
at december   lakeland had million in loans that were restructured and still accruing 
restructured loans are those loans where lakeland has granted concessions to the borrower in payment terms in rate and or in maturity as a result of the financial condition of the borrower 
the increase in restructured loans compared to prior years results from a deterioration in the economy impacting commercial real estate values and continuing high unemployment 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded  had the loans and leases classified at year end as non accrual been performing in conformance with their original terms  is approximately million 
the amount of interest income actually recorded on those loans and leases for was  the resultant loss of million for compares with prior year losses of million for and  for as of december   lakeland had impaired loans and leases totaling million consisting primarily of non accrual and restructured loans and leases 
the valuation allowance of these loans and leases is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral 
based upon such evaluation  million has been allocated to the allowance for loan and lease losses for impairment 
at december   lakeland also had million in loans and leases that were rated substandard that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no additional loans or leases at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired or substandard  where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would 
table of contents indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans or leases being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date

the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified classified loans and leases that have been designated as requiring attention by the company or the company s external loan review consultants 

table of contents the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans and leases not subject to specific review  including impaired commercial loans under  family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non classified loans and leases in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
a loan is reviewed for charge off when it is placed on non accrual status with a resulting charge off if the loan is not secured by collateral having sufficient liquidation value to repay the loan and the loan is not in the process of collection 
charge offs are recommended by the chief credit officer and approved by the board on a monthly basis 
while non performing loans and leases increased from million on december  to million on december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was of total loans and leases on december  compared to of total loans and leases on december  the increase in non accrual loans  as discussed above  was in residential mortgages and leases 
management believes  based on appraisals and estimated selling costs  that the majority of these loans are well secured and reserves on these loans are adequate 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan and lease portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans and leases that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans and leases in each category as well as historical trends

table of contents management and the board monitor the company s liquidity through the asset liability committee  which monitors the company s compliance with certain regulatory ratios and other various liquidity guidelines 
the company s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs  including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities

interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any off balance sheet hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
for example  when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  when interest earning assets reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  an increase in market rates could increase net interest income 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and 
table of contents ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
key quantitative measurements include the percentage change of net interest income in various interest rate scenarios net interest income at risk and changes in the market value of equity in various rate environments net portfolio value at risk 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee the alco  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity modeling is done at a specific point in time and involves a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
changes in estimates and assumptions made for interest rate sensitivity modeling could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
these assumptions could include prepayment rates  sensitivity of non maturity deposits and other similar assumptions 
therefore  if our assumptions should change  this technique may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the following year s net interest income assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at year end levels 
the net interest income estimated for the base case is million 
the information provided for net interest income assumes that changes in interest rates change gradually in equal increments rate ramp over the twelve month period

the information provided for the net portfolio value assumes fluctuations or rate shocks for changes in interest rates as shown in the table below 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately

table of contents the information set forth in the above tables is based on significant estimates and assumptions  and constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the information in the above tables represent the policy scenario that the alco reviews on a quarterly basis 
there are also other scenarios run that the alco examines that vary depending on the economic environment 
these scenarios include a yield curve flattening scenario and scenarios that show more dramatic changes in rates 
the committee uses the appropriate scenarios  depending on the economic environment  in its interest rate management decisions 
capital resources stockholders equity decreased from million on december  to million on december  the decrease in stockholders equity from december  to december  was primarily due to redemption of preferred stock from the u 
s treasury department totaling million and the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock of million 
partially offsetting these items was net income of million 
for more information on the redemption of preferred stock  please see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
book value per common share total common stockholders equity divided by the number of shares outstanding increased from on december  to on december  primarily as a result of net income 
book value per common share was on december  the fdic s risk based capital policy statement imposes a minimum capital standard on insured banks 
the minimum ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

this guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
this guidance also expands existing disclosure requirements to include more information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the recognition and measurement provisions regarding transfers of financial assets shall be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date 
the company applied this guidance on january   and application did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting guidance to enhance fair value measurement disclosures by requiring the reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reason for the transfers 
furthermore  activity in level fair value measurements should separately provide information about purchases  sales  issues and settlements rather than providing that information as one net number 
these new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the enhanced level disclosures  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company applied this guidance in the first quarter of and application did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about an entity s allowance for loan and lease losses and the credit quality of its loan and lease portfolio 
under the new guidelines  the allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value are to be disclosed by portfolio segment  while credit quality information  impaired loans and leases and non accrual status are to be presented by class of loans and leases 
disclosure of the nature and extent  the financial impact and segment information of troubled debt restructurings will also be required 
the disclosures are to be presented at the level of disaggregation that management uses when assessing and monitoring the loan and lease portfolio s risk and 
table of contents performance 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  with the exception of the troubled debt restructuring disclosures which are anticipated to be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the application of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by this guidance 
in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance that modifies step one of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist such as if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation
