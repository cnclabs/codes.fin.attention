table of contents business overview ziopharm oncology  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to develop and commercialize a diverse portfolio of in licensed cancer drugs that can address unmet medical needs 
our principal focus has been on the licensing and development of proprietary small molecule drug candidates that are related to cancer therapeutics already on the market or in development and that can be administered by intravenous iv and or oral dosing 
we are also pursuing the development of novel dna based biotherapeutics in the field of cancer pursuant to a partnering arrangement with intrexon corporation 
under the arrangement  we obtained rights to intrexon s entire in effector platform for use in the field of oncology  which includes two existing clinical stage product candidates 
we plan to leverage intrexon s synthetic biology platform for products to stimulate key pathways used by the body s immune system to inhibit the growth and metastasis of cancers  adding significantly to our small molecule drug development portfolio utilizing our global capabilities to translate science to the patient 
more detailed descriptions of palifosfamide  darinaparsin and indibulin  inxn and inxn  and our clinical development plans for each  are set forth in this report under the caption business product candidates 
development plans we are currently pursuing several clinical programs for our small molecule candidates  which include palifosfamide zymafos tm or zio completing our ongoing phase ii trial comparing doxorubicin plus palifosfamide to doxorubicin alone in patients with front and second line metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma  our recently initiated phase iii pivotal trial in front line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma  entitled picasso  our recently initiated phase i trial with palifosfamide in combination with etoposide and carboplatin to determine appropriate safety for initiating a subsequent randomized trial in front line small cell lung cancer  and pursuing a phase i study for an oral form of palifosfamide that we expect to initiate subject to obtaining fda approval to commence the trial 
darinaparsin zinapar tm or zio completing a phase i study of darinaparsin with the combination treatment regimen called chop in front line peripheral t cell lymphoma ptcl  initiating a two stage potentially pivotal trial likely in certain relapsed patients later this year  and completing an ongoing phase i study with an oral form of darinaparsin and  upon completion  conducting a phase ii study in solid tumors 
indibulin zybulin tm or zio completing a recently initiated phase i safety trial of oral indibulin in combination with xeloda tm and pursuing the commencement of a phase ii breast cancer trial 
we are also pursuing the development of the existing product candidates under our channel partnering arrangement with intrexon corporation  including inxn completing a phase ib trial in patients with advanced melanoma in that is on going in the us inxn  submitting an ind application with the intention of entering the clinic in a phase i trial targeting treatment of patients with late stage malignant melanoma  each of which we expect to occur during the first half of although we are pursuing these clinical programs  our principal focus remains on the clinical development of iv palifosfamide for soft tissue sarcoma  completing the ongoing phase ii trial and the recently initiated phase iii pivotal trial while also initiating the sclc phase i trial and  subject to obtaining fda approval  the phase i study with the oral form 
our current plans involve using internal financial resources to develop palifosfamide and pursue the clinical work discussed above  with the intention of ultimately partnering or otherwise raising additional resources to support further development activities for all of our product candidates 
based on these plans  we expect to incur the following expenses during the next twelve months approximately million on research and development expenses and approximately million on general corporate and administrative expenses 
this forecast of expenses is forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties  and 
table of contents the actual amount of our expenses over the next twelve months could vary materially and adversely as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this report and the uncertainties applicable to our forecast for the overall sufficiency of our capital resources  which are discussed under liquidity and capital resources below 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and our expenses could prove to be significantly higher than we currently anticipate 
furthermore  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate  are difficult to accurately predict  and will require us to obtain additional funding  either alone or in connection with partnering arrangements 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
to date  we have not received approval for the sale of any product candidates in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues from our product candidates 
financial overview overview of results of operations revenue 
we have not generated product revenues since our inception 
unless and until we receive approval from the fda and or other regulatory authorities for our product candidates  we cannot sell our products and will not have product revenues 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre clinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license and milestone payments and sponsored research fees paid to third parties 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis 
in  our clinical projects consisted primarily of a phase iii project for our lead product candidate palifosfamide 
this project was initiated during the expenses incurred by us to third parties were million for the year ended december  and million for project to date 
our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous pre clinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products or indications 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for pre clinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to require the expenditure of substantial resources 

table of contents we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines

clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patents  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term product related adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into appropriate collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could inversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our product development strategy 
our ability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  consulting and professional fees  including patent related costs  general corporate costs and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses or cost of product revenue 
other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of changes in the fair value of warrants

year ended  december in thousands change other income  net change in fair value of warrants   total   the increase in other income from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was due primarily to liability classified warrants being marked to market in see note to the financial statements  warrants  for a discussion on the reclassification of certain warrants from stockholders equity to liabilities on january  
additionally  interest income decreased due to lower cash balances on hand during liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  taking into account our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from our january sale of common stock to intrexon corporation pursuant to a private placement transaction and approximately million in net proceeds from our february public offering of common stock  and given our current plans for development of our product candidates  we anticipate that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations until late however  changes may occur that would consume our existing capital prior to that time  including the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and changes in governmental regulation 
actual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations  which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations 
specifically  we commenced the picasso pivotal trial for iv palifosfamide early in the third quarter of we have estimated the sufficiency of our cash resources based in part on this trial design and our timing expectations for enrollment in the study 
in addition  our forecast anticipates the initiation of a two stage potentially pivotal trial for the study of darinaparsin for the treatment of ptcl  likely in certain relapsed patients 
we also recently assumed responsibility for two product candidates under our exclusive channel partnership with intrexon corporation in early january we expect that the costs associated with these additional product candidates will increase the level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward 
although all human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement  we believe that costs associated with clinical trials for synthetic biology products are greater than the corresponding costs associated with clinical trials for small molecule candidates 
in addition to increased research and development costs  we have added headcount in part to support our exclusive channel partnership endeavors and are opening a small office in the greater washington dc area  which will add to our general and administrative expenses going forward 
although our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources takes into account our plans to develop the intrexon products  we have only recently assumed development responsibility for these products and the actual costs associated therewith may be significantly in excess of forecast amounts 
although our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources takes into account our plans to develop the intrexon products  we have only recently assumed development responsibility for these products and the actual costs associated therewith may be significantly in excess of forecast amounts 
in addition to these factors our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include  but are not limited to  changes in the focus and direction of our 
table of contents development programs  competitive and technical advances  costs associated with the development of our product candidates  our ability to secure partnering arrangements  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
if we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated  regardless of the reason  and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all  we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them we expect that we will need additional financing to support our long term plans for clinical trials and new product development 
we expect to finance our cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaborations and or debt financings  or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funding from any of these sources or  if obtained  what the terms of such funding s may be  or that any amount that the company is able to obtain will be adequate to support the company s working capital requirements until it achieves profitable operations 
other than the intrexon corporation equity purchase commitment see recent financing transactions intrexon corporation private placement and equity commitment below  we have no current committed sources of additional capital 
recently  capital markets have experienced a period of instability that may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development and regulatory approval of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all our research and development programs 
recent financing transactions intrexon corporation private placement and equity commitment on january   we completed a sale of common stock to intrexon corporation pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated january  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  intrexon purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to per share 
at the same time  we issued to intrexon  additional shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to the par value of such shares  which price was deemed paid in partial consideration for the execution and delivery of our exclusive channel partner agreement with intrexon 
the issuance and sale  which was conducted as a private placement transaction  resulted in cash proceeds to us of approximately million 
we have also agreed to issue additional shares of our common stock to intrexon upon dosing of the first patient in a ziopharm conducted phase ii clinical trial in the united states  or similar study as we and intrexon may agree in a country other than the united states  of a product that is created  produced  developed or identified directly or indirectly by us during the term of the exclusive channel partner agreement and that  subject to certain exceptions  involves dna administered to humans for expression of anti cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer 
upon satisfaction of such contingency  we have agreed to issue to intrexon  additional shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to the par value of such shares  which price will be deemed paid in partial consideration for the execution and delivery of the exclusive channel partner agreement 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we have agreed to file a registration statement with the sec registering the resale of the shares that we have issued or may issue to intrexon under the stock purchase agreement 
under the stock purchase agreement  if requested by the company and subject to certain restrictions and limitations  intrexon has agreed to purchase securities in conjunction with future securities offerings conducted by us that constitute qualified financings and that are conducted while the exclusive channel partner agreement remains in effect 
for this purpose  a qualified financing means a sale of common stock or equity securities convertible into common stock in a public or private offering  raising gross proceeds of at least  where the sale of shares is either registered under the securities act of  as amended  at the time of issuance or we agree to register the resale of such shares 
in conjunction with a qualified financing  intrexon has committed to purchase up to of the securities issued and sold by us therein such amount to be calculated exclusive of intrexon s purchase 
intrexon will not be obligated to purchase securities in a qualified financing unless we are then in substantial compliance with our obligations under the exclusive channel partner agreement and  with respect to a qualified financing that is completed following january   we confirm our intent that of the net offering proceeds the use of proceeds commitment amount shall have been spent  or in the next year will be spent  by us under the exclusive 
table of contents channel partner agreement 
in the case of a qualified financing that is completed after january   intrexon s purchase commitment will be further limited to an amount equal to of the use of proceeds commitment amount 
intrexon s aggregate purchase commitment for all future qualified financings is capped at  on february   we amended the stock purchase agreement to clarify that if intrexon voluntarily elects to purchase securities in a qualified financing in which we do not request that intrexon participate  the aggregate purchase price paid by intrexon for such securities will be applied against and reduce the then remaining maximum amount of intrexon  aggregate equity purchase commitment 
as a result of intrexon s purchase of securities in the february public offering described below  the remaining maximum amount of intrexon s equity purchase commitment is million 
february public offering on february   we entered into an underwriting agreement with barclays capital inc relating to the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock 
the price to the public in the offering was per share  and barclays capital  the sole book running manager for the offering  agreed to purchase the shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a purchase price of per share 
under the terms of the underwriting agreement  we also granted barclays capital an option  exercisable for days  to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the offering was made pursuant to our effective registration statement on form s registration statement no 
previously filed with the securities and exchange commission  and a prospectus supplement thereunder 
the transactions contemplated by the underwriting agreement were completed on february  in connection with the closing  barclays capital purchased the  firm shares contemplated by the underwriting agreement and exercised in full its option to purchase an additional  shares  resulting in our issuing a total of  shares at the closing 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses

our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies and professional fees 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development activities from our phase iii palifosfamide trial  partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities 
cash flow from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was thousand for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the year ended december  the increase was due to increased purchases of property plant and equipment 

table of contents cash flow from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million is primarily attributable differences in the levels of financing proceeds from year to year partially offset by the re purchase of common stock by the company to cover taxes upon vesting of previously granted restricted stock awards 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements the company anticipates that losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our actual cash requirements may vary materially from those planned because of a number of factors including changes in the focus  direction and pace of our development programs  competitive and technical advances  internal costs associated with the development of palifosfamide and indibulin and our ability to secure further financing for darinaparsin development from a partner  costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights  or other developments  and other matters identified under part ii item a

in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases royalty and license fees  contract milestone payments    total     our commitments for operating leases relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in new york  new york and our operations center in boston  massachusetts 
our commitments for royalty and license fees relate to our patent agreement with baxter healthcare corporation and our royalty agreements with southern research institute and baxter healthcare corporation requiring minimum royalty payments 
the contract milestone payments relate to our cro agreement with ppd development  l 
p 
the timing of the remaining contract milestone payments are dependent upon factors that are beyond our control  including our ability to recruit patients  the outcome of future clinical trials and any requirements imposed on our clinical trials by regulatory agencies 
however  for the purpose of the above table  we have assumed that the payment of the milestones will occur within five years of december  see note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following are our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements clinical trial expenses  fair value measurements  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organizations cro 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
fair value measurements we have warrant liabilities that are measured using fair value 
accounting standards define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
stock based compensation and warrants we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation awards 
in connection with valuing stock options and warrants we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the 
table of contents ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an annual basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic which improves disclosures about fair value measurements 
more specifically  asu updates topic to require disclosure of transfers in and out of levels and and the reason for the transfers 
additionally  it requires separate reporting of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level this update is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued final rule no 
 interactive data to improve financial reporting  which requires companies to submit financial statements in xbrl extensible business reporting language format with their sec filings 
the company will be required to provide interactive data reports starting with their first quarterly report for fiscal periods ending on or after june  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain our cash in interest bearing cash accounts 
as all of our investments are cash deposits in a global bank  it is subject to minimal interest rate risk 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct clinical studies outside of the united states primarily in western europe 
these business operations are not material at this time and therefore  any currency fluctuations will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
