item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition at december  and  and consolidated results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company is consolidated with its wholly owned subsidiaries hudson valley bank  na and its subsidiaries collectively hvb or the bank and hvhc risk management corp 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary financial information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of management s discussion and analysis this overview is intended to highlight selected information included in this annual report on form k 
it does not contain sufficient information for a complete understanding of the company s financial condition and operating results and  therefore  should be read in conjunction with this entire annual report on form k 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from providing banking and related services to businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals within its market area  primarily westchester county and rockland county  new york  portions of new york city and fairfield county and new haven county  connecticut 
the company s assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  which are funded by deposits  borrowings and capital 
the primary source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on loans and investments  and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
the company s basic strategy is to grow net interest income and non interest income by the retention of its existing customer base and the expansion of its core businesses and branch offices within its current market and surrounding areas 
considering current economic conditions  the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk  the risk of deterioration of market values of collateral supporting the company s loan portfolio  particularly commercial and residential real estate and potential risks associated with the impact of regulatory changes that may take place in reaction to current conditions in the financial system 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
commercial and residential real estate are the primary collateral for the majority of company s loans 
the wide ranging economic downturn  which began in and continued throughout and  has had extremely negative effects on all financial sectors both domestic and foreign 
perhaps the most severe impact of this downturn has been felt by the real estate industry  which is a major source of both the deposit and loan businesses of the company 
although recent indications suggest that the economic decline has begun to turn around  the company expects this recovery to be slow and expects to continue to experience some negative pressure from these adverse conditions into the first quarter of and beyond 
net income for was million or per diluted share  a decrease of million or percent compared to million or per diluted share in the overall decline in earnings in  compared to  resulted primarily from significant increases in the provision for loan losses which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year period 
earnings were also adversely affected by real estate owned valuation provisions of million and million  respectively  in the second and third quarters of these provisions are reflective of continued weakness in the overall economy which has resulted in the company s decision to follow a more aggressive strategy for problem asset resolution further discussed below 
total loans decreased million during the year ended december  this decline resulted from a number of factors including decreased loan demand  charge offs  pay downs of existing loans and the transfer of million of nonperforming loans to the loans held for sale category 
the company recognized million of net charge offs during despite the weakness in loan demand  and the continuation of pressure on overall asset quality caused by the ongoing effects of the economic downturn  the company continues to provide lending availability to both new and existing customers 
overall asset quality continued to be adversely affected by the current state of the economy and the real estate market 
nonperforming assets  which include nonaccrual loans  accruing loans delinquent over days and other 
table of contents real estate owned  decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease included the transfer of million of nonperforming loans to the loans held for sale category 
the company has continued to experience a slowdown in payments of certain loans  such as construction loans  whose repayment is often dependent on sales of completed properties  as well as increases in delinquent and nonperforming loans in other sectors of the loan portfolio  all of which have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn and decline in the real estate market 
these conditions have resulted in severe declines in the demand for and values of virtually all commercial and residential real estate properties 
these declines  together with the limited availability of residential mortgage financing  resulted in continued downward pressure on the overall asset quality of the company s loan portfolio during in addition  recent significant increases in filings of bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings have overloaded the court systems and have resulted in what the company believes to be unacceptable delays in attempts to obtain title to real estate and other collateral through conventional foreclosure 
as a result of above factors  since the second quarter of  the company has followed a more aggressive strategy for resolving problem assets 
as part of the revised resolution strategy  the company has reevaluated each problem loan and has made a determination of net realizable value based on management s estimation of the best possible outcome considering the individual characteristics of each asset against the likelihood of resolution with the current borrower  expectations for resolution through the court system  or other available market opportunities 
the severity of the decline in real estate values has provided new market opportunities for the disposition of distressed assets as investors search for yield in the current low interest rate environment and our more aggressive policy has begun to take advantage of those opportunities 
as part of this revised strategy  during the third quarter of  the company transferred twenty five loans totaling million to the loans held for sale category 
partial charge offs of these loans to adjust their carrying amount to estimated fair value accounted for million of the million of net charge offs recorded during the full year of approximately million of these loans were sold in december of without further loss 
the remaining million are expected to be disposed of in the first or second quarters of as noted above  despite recent indications suggesting that the economic decline may have begun to turn around  the company expects any recovery to be slow and expects to continue to experience some negative pressure from these adverse conditions into the first quarter of and beyond 
total deposits increased million during the year ended december   as the company continued to experience significant growth in new customers both in existing branches and new branches added during the last two years 
overall deposit growth was partially offset by planned reductions in certain non core deposit balances 
proceeds from deposit growth were used to reduce maturing term borrowings or were retained in liquid investments  principally interest earning bank deposits 
as a result of the aforementioned activity in the company s core businesses of loans and deposits and other asset liability management activities  tax equivalent basis net interest income declined by million or percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the effect of the adjustment to a tax equivalent basis was million in and million in non interest income was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase was partially due to an increase in investment advisory fees 
fee income from this source increased primarily as a result of the effects of recent improvement in both domestic and international equity markets 
assets under management were approximately billion at december  and billion at december  the overall increases in non interest income also included growth in deposit service charges 
non interest income also included recognized pre tax impairment charges on securities available for sale of million in and million in the impairment charges were related to the company s investments in pooled trust preferred securities 
non interest income for and also included million and million of valuation losses on other real estate owned 
non interest expense was million for both and increases in non interest expense resulting from the company s continued investment in its branch offices  technology and personnel to accommodate growth  the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers and the upgrading of certain internal processes were more than offset by cost saving measures implemented by the company during and in 
table of contents addition  reflected significantly lower fdic deposit insurance premiums 
additional premiums imposed by the fdic in to replenish shortfalls in the fdic insurance fund were not imposed to the same degree in however  additional premium increases and special assessments may continue to be imposed by the fdic in the future 
decreases resulting from the lower fdic premiums and other cost saving measures were offset by significant increases in costs related to problem loan resolutions and other real estate owned 
the company uses a simulation analysis to estimate the effect that specific movements in interest rates would have on net interest income 
excluding the effects of planned growth and anticipated new business  the simulation analysis at december  shows the company s net interest income decreasing slightly if rates fall and increasing slightly if rates rise 
the company has established specific policies and operating procedures governing its liquidity levels to address future liquidity needs  including contingent sources of liquidity 
while the current adverse economic situation has put pressure on the availability of liquidity in the marketplace  the company believes that its present liquidity and borrowing capacity are sufficient for its current business needs 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital guidelines 
in today s economic and regulatory environment the occ  which is the primary federal regulator of the bank  has directed greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the occ required hvb to maintain  by december   a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 
to meet these increased capital ratios and to support future growth  the company successfully raised a net million in an underwritten common stock offering in the fourth quarter of as of december   and  the company and hvb exceeded all required regulatory capital levels 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgements  and therefore  are critical to understanding the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
securities securities are classified as either available for sale  representing securities the company may sell in the ordinary course of business  or as held to maturity  representing securities that the company has determined that it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell prior to maturity or recovery of cost 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax excluded from operations and reported in other comprehensive income 
securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
interest income includes amortization of purchase premium and accretion of purchase discount 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is determined by using the level yield method 
securities are not acquired for purposes of engaging in trading activities 
realized gains and losses from sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
the company regularly reviews declines in the fair value of securities below their costs for purposes of determining whether such declines are other than temporary in nature 
in estimating other than temporary impairment otti  management considers adverse changes in expected cash flows  the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
the company also assesses whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment is split into two components as 
table of contents follows otti related to credit loss  which must be recognized in the income statement and otti related to other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans  and a formula component which addresses historical loan loss experience together with other relevant risk factors affecting the portfolio 
the specific component incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as required by the receivables topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
these accounting standards prescribe the measurement methods  income recognition and disclosures related to impaired loans 
a loan is recognized as impaired when it is probable that principal and or interest are not collectible in accordance with the loan s contractual terms 
in addition  a loan which has been renegotiated with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties for which the terms of the loan have been modified with a concession that the company would not otherwise have granted are considered troubled debt restructurings and are also recognized as impaired 
a loan is not deemed to be impaired if there is a short delay in receipt of payment or if  during a longer period of delay  the company expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual rate during the period of delay 
measurement of impairment can be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
if the fair value of an impaired loan is less than the related recorded amount  a specific valuation component is established within the allowance for loan losses or  if the impairment is considered to be permanent  a partial charge off is recorded against the allowance for loan losses 
individual measurement of impairment does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as portions of the company s portfolios of home equity loans  real estate mortgages  installment and other loans 
the formula component is calculated by first applying historical loss experience factors to outstanding loans by type 
this component is then adjusted to reflect additional risk factors not addressed by historical loss experience 
these factors include the evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
senior management reviews these conditions quarterly 
management s evaluation of the loss related to each of these conditions is quantified by loan type and reflected in the formula component 
the evaluations of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of such evaluations and because they are not identified with specific problem credits 
actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology permits adjustments to the allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors which affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date have changed 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is the best estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of december  there is no assurance that the company will not be required to make future adjustments to the allowance in response to changing economic conditions  particularly in the company s service area  since the majority of the company s loans are collateralized by real estate 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments at the time of their examinations 
other real estate owned oreo real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value  net of estimated selling costs  at time of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis 
credit losses arising at the time of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent valuations are 
table of contents periodically performed by management and the carrying value is adjusted by a charge to expense to reflect any subsequent declines in the estimated fair value 
routine holding costs are charged to expense as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization 
identified intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those lives by a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are used up 
all goodwill and identified intangible assets are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
if such testing indicates impairment in the values and or remaining amortization periods of the intangible assets  adjustments are made to reflect such impairment 
the company s impairment evaluations as of december  and december  did not indicate impairment of its goodwill or identified intangible assets 
income taxes income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  summary of results the company reported net income of million in  a decrease of million or percent compared to million in  which decreased million or percent compared to million in the decrease in net income  compared to  reflected a significantly higher provision for loan losses  lower net interest income and slightly higher noninterest expense  partially offset by higher non interest income and a lower effective tax rate 
the decrease in net income  compared to  reflected a significantly higher provision for loan losses  higher noninterest expense including significantly higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and lower non interest income  partially offset by higher net interest income and a lower effective tax rate 
provisions for loan losses totaled million  million and million in  and respectively 
non interest income includes million  million and million of pretax recognized impairment charges related to certain securities in the company s investment portfolio in  and  respectively 
non interest income also includes million and million of valuation losses on other real estate owned in and  respectively 
non interest expense includes million  million and million of fdic deposit insurance premiums in  and  respectively 
the significantly higher levels of the provisions for loan losses  recognized impairment charges  valuation losses on other real estate owned and fdic deposit insurance premiums in and  compared to  are a direct result of the significantly negative effects that the ongoing economic downturn has had on the performance and collateral values of the company s loan portfolios  the underlying credit and marketability of certain securities in its investment portfolio  and the overall performance of the financial services industry in general 
diluted earnings per share were in  a decrease of or percent compared to in  which decreased or percent compared to in these changes are a direct result of the changes in net income in the respective years compared to the prior year period 
prior period per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the percent stock dividend distributed in december returns on average stockholders equity and average assets were percent and percent for  compared to percent and percent in and percent and percent in returns on adjusted average stockholders equity were percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
adjusted average stockholders equity excludes the effects of net unrealized gains  net of tax of  and and unrealized losses  net of tax  of  on securities available for sale in  and  respectively 
the annualized return on adjusted average stockholders equity is  under sec regulations  a non gaap financial measure 
management believes that this non gaap financial measures more closely reflects actual performance  as it is more consistent with the company s stated asset liability management strategies  which do not contemplate significant realization of market gains or 
table of contents losses on securities available for sale which were primarily related to changes in interest rates or illiquidity in the marketplace 
net interest income for was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to million in  which increased million or percent compared to million in the decrease compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to from  partially offset by million growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which was in excess of the million growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin  compared to the prior year  resulted primarily from the effects significant increases in the average balance of low yielding interest bearing deposits in banks as a percentage of interest earning assets resulting primarily from weak loan demand  the completion of a planned reduction of the company s investment portfolio and the effects of maturing  higher yielding loans and investments being renewed or replaced in a significantly lower interest rate environment 
the increase over was primarily due to million growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which was in excess of the million growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a reduction in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to in from in the decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin  compared to the prior year  was primarily as a result of a slight reduction in the incremental spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets reflected growth in loans and short term funds  partially offset by a planned reduction in investments 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities reflected growth in deposits  partially offset by a planned reduction in short term and other borrowed funds 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in and million in the significant increases in and  compared to their respective prior year periods is primarily directly related to negative effects on the loan portfolio of conditions resulting from the ongoing crisis in the financial markets 
as a result of the severe economic downturn  the company has experienced significant levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans and a continuation of the slowdowns in repayments and declines in the loan to value ratios on existing loans which began in the second half of and has continued throughout and these conditions  together with the shortage of available residential mortgage financing  have put downward pressure on the overall asset quality of virtually all financial institutions  including the company 
in addition since the second quarter of  the company has followed the more aggressive strategy for resolving problem assets including the transfer of million of nonperforming loans  to the held for sale category 
the company believes that the overall revised strategy will continue to address new and existing problem loans in the most appropriate and timely manner given current conditions in the economy 
non interest income increased million or percent to million in compared to million in  which decreased million or percent compared to million in the increase of noninterest income in  compared to the prior year period  was primarily due to increases in investment advisory fees of ar schmeidler co  inc  growth in deposit activity and other service fees and a decrease in recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale  partially offset by an increase in valuation losses on other real estate owned 
the company s non interest income decreased in  compared to the prior year period  primarily as a result of a significant increase in recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale and a significant decrease in investment advisory fees  partially offset by a decline in deposit activity and other service income 
investment advisory fee income experienced significant declines beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued to decline during the first half of as a result of significant declines in both domestic and international equity markets 
although there was significant improvement in the financial markets in late and  continued improvement and the continued acquisition of new customers will be necessary for this source of non interest income to return to past levels 
the company recorded pre tax recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other dispositions of securities available for sale resulted in net realized gains of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the sales were conducted as part of the company s ongoing asset liability management process 
non interest income also includes million and million of valuation losses on other real estate owned in and  respectively 

table of contents non interest expense was million for both and the amount reflected an increase of million or percent compared to million in increases in non interest expense resulting from the company s continued investment in its branch offices  technology and personnel to accommodate growth  the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers and the upgrading of certain internal processes were more than offset by cost saving measures implemented by the company during and in addition  reflected significantly lower fdic deposit insurance premiums compared to additional premiums imposed by the fdic in to replenish shortfalls in the fdic insurance fund were not imposed to the same degree in however  additional premium increases and special assessments may continue to be imposed by the fdic in the future

increases in resulting from the company s continued investment in its branch offices  technology and personnel to accommodate growth in loans and deposits  the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers and the upgrading of certain internal processes were effectively offset by significant other cost saving measures implemented by the company during the year  including the elimination of all incentive compensation and bonuses for employees of the bank 
however  overall non interest expense increased  compared to the prior year period  primarily due to aforementioned significant increase in fdic deposit premiums 
the effective tax rate in decreased to percent  compared to percent in and percent in the tax benefit recorded in resulted from the effects of tax exempt income exceeding taxable income for the year primarily due to the significant loan loss provision 
the decrease  compared to the prior year period  was primarily as a result of tax exempt income constituting a greater percentage of pretax income due to the significant increase in the loan loss provision and recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale

net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the most significant component of the company s consolidated earnings 
during the three year period ended december   the overall economic picture  both globally and in the company s market area  has been one of historic low interest rates  severe economic downturn in virtually every sector of the economy  sharp declines in asset values particularly in the commercial and residential real estate sectors  weak loan demand and shrinking margins 
the company s overall asset quality has continued to be adversely affected by the current state of the economy 
during and  the company has experienced significant levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans and a continuation of the slowdowns in repayments and declines in the loan to value ratios on existing loans which began in the second half of changes in the levels of nonperforming loans have a direct impact on net interest income 
while there are recent signs that the economic downturn has begun to reverse  the company expects some continued downward pressure on net interest income for the near future as a result of ongoing lag effect of these conditions 
the company has made efforts throughout this period of severe economic uncertainty and low interest rates to minimize the impact on its net interest income by appropriately repositioning its securities portfolio and funding 
table of contents sources while maintaining prudence and awareness of the potential consequences that the current economic crisis could have on its asset quality and interest rate risk profiles 
during and  the company was able to repay maturing long term borrowings  all of its brokered certificates of deposit and non customer related short term borrowings with liquidity provided primarily by core deposit growth and planned utilization of run off from our investment securities 
additional liquidity from deposit growth was retained in the company s short term liquidity portfolios  available to fund future loan growth 
with interest rates remaining at historically low levels  this increase in liquidity contributed to margin compression 
also during and  the company increased the number of loans originated with interest rate floors and  as part of the continuation of a planned reduction of the company s investment portfolio  targeting cash flow from maturing investment securities to fund current and future loan growth 
these actions were conducted partially in reaction to severely declining interest rates 
the company s ability to make changes in its asset mix allows management to capitalize on more desirable yields  as available  on various interest earning assets 
management believes that the result of these efforts has enabled the company  given the difficulties being encountered in the current economic crisis  to maximize the effective repositioning of its portfolios from both asset and interest rate risk perspectives

the effects of these non gaap adjustments to tax equivalent basis net interest income and adjusted average assets are included in the table presented in average balances and interest rates section herein 
interest income is determined by the volume of and related rates earned on interest earning assets

the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was percent in  compared to percent in as a result of these factors  interest expense was lower in  compared to  due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher volume 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities in  compared to  was due to volume increases in interest bearing demand deposits  partially offset by volume decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings and other borrowings  and a slight volume decrease in time deposits

at december   one tdr with a carrying amount of million was on accrual status and performing in accordance with its modified terms 
all other tdrs as of december  and were on nonaccrual status 
there were no tdrs at december  other pertinent data related to the company s loan portfolio are contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
the company performs extensive ongoing asset quality monitoring by both internal and independent loan review functions 
in addition  the company conducts timely remediation and collection activities through a network of internal and external resources which include an internal asset recovery department  real estate and other loan workout attorneys and external collection agencies 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the company decided to implement a more aggressive workout strategy for the resolution of problem assets in light of a sluggish economic recovery  continued weakness in local real estate activity and market values and growing difficulty in resolving problem loans in a timely fashion through traditional foreclosure proceedings due to increased bankruptcy filings and overcrowded court systems 
see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion of this strategy 
management believes that these efforts are appropriate for accomplishing either successful remediation or maximizing collections related to nonperforming assets 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans and a formula component to consider historical loan loss experience and additional risk factors affecting the portfolio 

table of contents a summary of the components of the allowance for loan losses  changes in the components and the impact of charge offs recoveries on the resulting provision for loan losses for the dates indicated is as follows s change change december  during december  during december  components specific real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total specific component formula real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total formula component total allowance net change net charge offs provision for loan losses 
table of contents change change change during december  during december  during december  components specific real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total specific component formula real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total formula component total allowance net change amount acquired net charge offs provision for loan losses the formula component is calculated by first applying historical loss experience factors to outstanding loans by type  excluding loans for which a specific allowance has been determined 
this component is then adjusted to reflect additional risk factors not addressed by historical loss experience 
these factors include the evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
senior management reviews these conditions quarterly 
management s evaluation of the loss related to these conditions is quantified by loan type and reflected in the formula component 
the evaluations of the incurred loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of such evaluations and because they are not identified with specific problem credits 

table of contents the specific component of the allowance for loan losses is the result of our analysis of impaired loans and our determination of the amount required to reduce the carrying amount of such loans to estimated fair value 
accordingly  such allowance is dependent on the particular loans and their characteristics at each measurement date  not necessarily the total amount of such loans 
the company usually records partial charge offs as opposed to specific reserves for impaired loans that are real estate collateral dependent and for which independent appraisals have determined the fair value of the collateral to be less than the carrying amount of the loan 
in  the company decided to implement a more aggressive workout strategy for the resolution of problem assets in light of a sluggish economic recovery  continued weakness in local real estate activity and market values and growing difficulty in resolving problem loans in a timely fashion through traditional foreclosure proceedings due to increased bankruptcy filings and overcrowded court systems 
the severity of the decline in real estate values has provided new market opportunities for the disposition of distressed assets as investors search for yield in the current low interest rate environment and our more aggressive policy may be able to take advantage of those opportunities 
as part of the revised resolution strategy  the company has reevaluated each problem loan and has made a determination of net realizable value based on management s estimation of the best probable outcome considering the individual characteristics of each asset against the likelihood of resolution with the current borrower  expectations for resolution through the court system  or other available market opportunities including potential loan sales 
the effects of this new strategy are reflected in significant charge offs  as well as in a million increase in the formula component of the allowance at december  compared to december  the reduction in the specific component at december  resulted from partial charge offs taken during on loans with specific reserves at december  on september   the company transferred million of nonperforming loans to the loans held for sale category 
during the fourth quarter of  a significant portion of the sale had been completed  leaving a balance of million in nonperforming loans held for sale in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
at december   the company had million of specific reserves allocated to three impaired loans 
there were million of specific reserves allocated to seven impaired loans as of december  the company s analyses as of december  and december  indicated that impaired loans were principally real estate collateral dependent and that  with the exception of those loans for which specific reserves were assigned  there was sufficient underlying collateral value or guarantees to indicate expected recovery of the carrying amount of the loans 
the changes in the formula component of the allowance for loan losses are the result of the application of historical loss experience to outstanding loans by type 
loss experience for each year is based upon average charge off experience for the prior three year period by loan type 
the formula component is then adjusted to reflect changes in other relevant factors affecting loan collectibility 
management periodically adjusted the formula component to an amount that  when considered with the specific component  represented its best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
the following are the major add on factors which affected the changes in the formula component of the allowance for loan losses each year economic and business conditions the volatility in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in construction  the demand for and value of real estate  the primary collateral for the company s loans  and the level of real estate taxes within the company s market area  together with the general state of the economy  trigger economic uncertainty 
while there continue to be some recent signs of increased activity in the real estate sectors of the market  persistent negative effects from the unprecedented economic downturn experienced in and have continued to negatively affect the cash flow of many of the company s customers in in addition  significant increases in filings of bankruptcy and foreclosure proceedings have overloaded the court systems and have resulted in what the company believes to be unacceptable delays in attempts to obtain title to real estate and other collateral through conventional foreclosure which has resulted in the company considering alternate strategies for problem loan resolution including loan sales 
although current indicators show that the economic downturn may have begun to turn around  recovery is expected to be a slow process 
also  despite evidence of recent improvement  there has been continued volatility in housing prices and the availability of mortgage financing continues to be limited 
after considering the significant increase in the historical loss factor resulting from the impact of net charge offs  the company has continued to include an additional factor for adverse economic and business conditions in the determination of the formula component of the allowance 
the aforementioned factors 
table of contents were reduced slightly during from december levels due to management s judgment of limited improvement in major economic indicators  and have remained unchanged since then  due to the continuing lag effect of the economic downturn offsetting the improvements in the economic indicators 
concentration the primary collateral for the company s loans is real estate  particularly commercial real estate 
the economic downturn has had a severe negative effect on activity and values throughout the real estate industry  which has heightened risk associated with this concentration 
therefore  consideration of the changes in levels of risk associated with concentrations resulting from adverse conditions in the marketplace is part of the determination of the formula component of the allowance 
as result of charge offs  paydowns and reduced production of new loans  concentrations in construction loans have been significantly reduced  and concentrations in commercial real estate loans have grown slightly 
after considering the significant increase in the historical loss factor resulting from net charge offs and the overall reduction in total construction loans  in the third quarter the company slightly reduced the additional factor for concentrations in construction compared to december the additional factor for concentration in commercial real estate was maintained at the december level as there was no significant change in the concentration 
collateral values real estate loans in general have taken on a heightened degree of risk during the recent economic downturn 
underlying values of real estate have generally declined throughout both nationally and within our local market area 
construction loans  in particular  have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans which the company makes  since repayment of the loans is generally dependent on the borrowers ability to successfully construct and sell or lease completed properties 
after considering the significant increase in the historical loss factor resulting from net charge offs  the company increased the additional factor for real estate values on construction loans and commercial real estate loans in the first two quarters of this increase was designed at that time to reflect significant valuation adjustments expected to result from the loan sale being contemplated as part of the company s more aggressive strategy on loan resolution which began in the second quarter of upon completion of partial charge offs related to the valuation adjustments related to the sale  the additional factors were reduced in the third quarter  and maintained for the remainder of the at a level slightly above the amounts of december the additional factor for residential real estate values had been higher than that for commercial real estate in december as the impact of the financial downturn on the company s residential portfolio had been felt earlier in the cycle 
the additional factor however was increased in the second quarter of as certain nonperforming residential loans were also being considered for sale 
upon completion of partial charge offs related to the sale  the additional factor was reduced in the third quarter  and maintained for the remainder of at the december level 
asset quality changes in the amount of nonperforming loans  classified loans  delinquencies  and the results of the company s periodic loan review process are also considered in the process of determining the formula component 
during the year ended december   the lagging effects of the economic downturn within the economy and our local market area have had negative effects on the company s loans 
significant charge offs have continued to increase the historical loss factor used for determination of the formula component of the allowance  and continued additions to nonperforming assets and fluctuating delinquency  have added additional economic uncertainty  although the company has experienced some recent improvement in overall delinquencies 
after considering the significant increase in the historical loss factor resulting from net charge offs  in the third quarter of the company reduced the additional factors for charge offs compared to december  as management believes the impact of the level of charge offs recorded in have had more than a sufficient impact on the historical loss factor 
this level was maintained for the remainder of the additional factors for delinquency and extension risk were generally reduced slightly below december levels by the third quarter of  reflective of general improvement in delinquency levels after the aggressive resolution strategy implemented in the second quarter 
this level was maintained in the fourth quarter as there was no evidence to warrant further adjustment to the factor after considering the combination of the increase in the historical loss factor and the changes in the delinquency pipeline 
nature of portfolio volume we purchase loan participations from a number of banks  including some outside our primary market area 
while we review each loan and make our own determination regarding whether to participate in the loan  we rely on the other bank s knowledge of their customer and marketplace 

table of contents due to the severely negative impact that the recent economic downturn has had on the financial services industry  risk associated with participation with other financial institutions has increased 
the company also recognizes potential risk differentials between different types of collateral within portfolios 
owner occupied versus non owner occupied real estate and primary versus secondary liens are examples 
the potential impact of these factors on any probable losses with respect to nature of portfolio volume is considered in the determination of the formula component of the allowance for loan losses 
despite the significant increase in the historical loss factor resulting from net charge offs  the company has maintained or  in the case of the additional factor for commercial real estate  slightly reduced the additional factors for nature of portfolio volume compared to december  in the determination of the formula component of the allowance  as it does not believe that there has been significant changes in these risk factors during economic and business conditions the volatility in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in construction  the demand for and value of real estate  the primary collateral for the company s loans  and the level of real estate taxes within the company s market area  together with the general state of the economy  trigger economic uncertainty 
during  these factors generally continued to worsen  particularly in the second quarter 
although there may be indications that the economic downturn has bottomed out  we believe any economic recovery will be a slow process 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of and continuing through  housing prices have significantly declined and the availability of mortgage financing continues to be limited 
we have considered these trends in determining the formula component of the allowance for loan losses 
concentration the primary collateral for the company s loans is real estate  particularly commercial real estate 
the current economic downturn has had a severely negative effect on activity and values throughout the real estate industry  which has heightened risk associated with this concentration 
therefore  consideration of the changes in levels of risk associated with concentrations resulting from adverse conditions in the marketplace is part of the determination of the formula component of the allowance 
credit risk construction loans currently have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans which the company makes  since repayment of the loans is generally dependent on the borrowers ability to successfully construct and sell or lease completed properties 
changes in concentration and the associated changes in various risk factors are considered in the determination of the formula component of the allowance 
during the year ended december   the market for new construction has continued to slow significantly in the company s primary market area 
houses are taking longer to sell and prices have declined 
we have considered these trends in determining the formula component of the allowance for loan losses 
asset quality changes in the amount of nonperforming loans  classified loans  delinquencies  and the results of the company s periodic loan review process are also considered in the process of determining the formula component 
during the year ended december   nonperforming assets and delinquencies increased substantially 
we believe the overall increase in nonperforming assets in is due to lagging effects of the economic downturn within the economy and our local market area 
loan participations we purchase loan participations from a number of banks  including some outside our primary market area 
while we review each loan and make our own determination regarding whether to participate in the loan  we rely on the other bank s knowledge of their customer and marketplace 
since many of these relationships are new  we do not yet have an established record of performance and  therefore  any probable losses with respect to these new loan participation relationships is considered in the determination of the formula component of the allowance for loan losses economic and business conditions the volatility in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in construction  the demand for and value of real estate  the primary collateral for the company s loans  and the level of real estate taxes within the company s market area  together with the general state of the economy  trigger economic uncertainty 
during the year ended december   these factors have generally 
table of contents worsened 
further deterioration in the economy in general and business conditions in the company s primary market area continue 
during the fourth quarter  housing prices have significantly declined and the availability of mortgage financing is limited 
we have considered these trends in determining the formula component of the allowance for loan losses 
credit risk construction loans currently have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans which the company makes  since repayment of the loans is generally dependent on the borrowers ability to successfully construct and sell or lease completed properties

during the year ended december   nonperforming assets increased 
we believe this increase is due to current trends within the economy and our local market area 
loan participations we will purchase loan participations from a number of banks  including some outside our primary market area 
while we review each loan and make our own determination regarding whether to participate in the loan  we rely on the other bank s knowledge of their customer and marketplace 
since many of these relationships are new  we do not yet have an established record of performance and  therefore  any probable losses with respect to these new loan participation relationships is considered in the determination of the formula component of the allowance for loan losses

the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during  million for and million in the provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors previously discussed under allowance for loan losses 
deposits the company s fundamental source of funds supporting interest earning assets is deposits  consisting of non interest bearing demand deposits  checking with interest  money market  savings and various forms of time deposits 
the maintenance of a strong deposit base is key to the development of lending opportunities and creates long term customer relationships  which enhance the ability to cross sell services 
depositors include businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals 
to meet the requirements of a diverse customer base  a full range of deposit instruments are offered  which has allowed the company to maintain and expand its deposit base despite intense competition from other banking institutions and non bank financial service providers 
total deposits at december  increased million or percent to  million  from  million at december   which increased million or percent from  million at december  in  approximately million of this growth resulted from the transfer of certain money market mutual fund investments of existing customers to interest bearing demand deposits 
this transfer was primarily due to the recent increase in fdic insurance coverage of certain deposit products which was part of the legislation enacted in response to the current economic crisis 
in addition to the above mentioned deposit growth  the company also experienced significant growth in new customers both in existing branches and new branches added during and this growth was partially offset by some declines in balances of existing customers  primarily those customers directly involved in or supported by the real estate industry 
proceeds from deposit growth were used primarily to reduce long term and short term borrowings and to fund loan growth

additional liquidity is also provided by the company s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings

in conjunction with this common stock offering  the company listed its common stock on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol huvl 
concurrent with listing its common stock on the nasdaq  the company lifted all restrictions on transferability of its common stock that previously applied to certain shareholders and a majority of the shares outstanding 
a total of million of the net proceeds from this offering was contributed to hvb increasing the bank s capital ratios  as required of the bank by the occ  to levels in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations

the remaining net proceeds of this offering are available for general corporate purposes 
the company paid its first cash dividend in  and the board of directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend policy in the first quarter of hvb s payment of dividends to the company  the company s primary source of funds  is subject to limitation by federal and state regulators based on such factors as the maintenance of adequate capital  which could reduce the amount of dividends otherwise payable 
see business supervision and regulation 
the various components and changes in stockholders equity are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity for the years ended december   and included elsewhere herein 
management believes that future retained earnings will provide the necessary capital for current operations and the planned growth in total assets 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter dated february  to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate  defer or severely limit dividends including  for example  when net income available for shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the 
table of contents dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital during the quarter 
all banks and bank holding companies are subject to risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines define capital as tier and total capital 
tier capital consists of common stockholders equity and qualifying preferred stock  less intangibles  and total capital consists of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses up to certain limits  preferred stock and certain subordinated and term debt securities 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of percent  and a minimum tier risk based capital ratio of percent 
banks and bank holding companies must also maintain a minimum leverage ratio of percent  which consists of tier capital based on risk based capital guidelines  divided by average tangible assets excluding intangible assets that were deducted to arrive at tier capital 
in today s economic and regulatory environment  banking regulators  including the occ  which is the primary federal regulator of the bank  are directing greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans 
due to the high percentage of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio  we are among the banks subject to such greater regulatory scrutiny 
as a result of this concentration  the increase in the level of our non performing loans  and the potential for further possible deterioration in our loan portfolio  the occ required hvb to maintain  since december   a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 
the capital ratios at december  are as follows tier capital company hvb nynb n a total capital company hvb nynb n a leverage company hvb nynb n a management intends to conduct the affairs of the bank so as to maintain a strong capital position in the future 
liquidity the asset liability strategic committee alsc of the board of directors of hvb establishes specific policies and operating procedures governing the company s liquidity levels and develops plans to address future liquidity needs  including contingent sources of liquidity 
the primary functions of asset liability management are to provide safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirement of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to manage fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company s liquid assets  at december   include cash and due from banks of million and federal funds sold of million 
federal funds sold represents the company s excess liquid funds that are invested with other financial institutions in need of funds and which mature daily 

table of contents other sources of liquidity include maturities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
the loan and securities portfolios provide a constant stream of maturing assets and reinvestable cash flows  which can be converted into cash should the need arise 
the ability to redeploy these funds is an important source of medium to long term liquidity 
the amortized cost of securities having contractual maturities  expected call dates or average lives of one year or less amounted to million at december  this represented percent of the amortized cost of the securities portfolio 
excluding installment loans to individuals  real estate loans other than construction loans and lease financing  million  or percent of loans at december   mature in one year or less 
the company may increase liquidity by selling certain residential mortgages  or exchanging them for mortgage backed securities that may be sold in the secondary market 
non interest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits from businesses  professionals  not for profit organizations and individuals are a relatively stable  low cost source of funds 
the deposits of the bank generally have shown a steady growth trend as well as a generally consistent deposit mix 
however  there can be no assurance that deposit growth will continue or that the deposit mix will not shift to higher rate products 
the bank is a member of the fhlb 
as such  we are able to participate in various fhlb borrowing programs which require certain investments in fhlb common stock as a prerequisite to obtaining funds 
as of december   hvb had short term borrowing lines with the fhlb of million with no balances outstanding 
these and various other fhlb borrowing programs available to members are subject to availability of qualifying loan and or investment securities collateral and other terms and conditions 
the bank also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million with three major financial institutions which were all unused and available at december  in addition  hvb has approved lines under retail certificate of deposit agreements with three major financial institutions totaling approximately million which were also unused and available at december  the retail certificates of deposit lines are subject to product availability and other restrictions 
additional liquidity is also provided by the bank s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings 
the bank has been approved to participate in the bic program 
there were no amounts outstanding with the federal reserve at december  the various borrowing programs discussed above are subject to certain restrictions and terms and conditions which may include continued availability of such borrowing programs  the company s ability to pledge qualifying collateral in sufficient amounts  the company s maintenance of capital ratios acceptable to these lenders and other conditions which may be imposed on the company 
as of december   the company had qualifying loan and investment securities totaling approximately million which could be utilized under available borrowing programs thereby increasing liquidity 
the company also has outstanding  at any time  a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties 
these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments 
guarantees specify limits to the company s obligations 
because many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
the company is also obligated under leases or license agreements for certain of its branches and equipment

the assets pledged consist of certain loans secured by real estate  us treasury and government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  certain obligations of state and political subdivisions and other securities 
management monitors its liquidity requirements by assessing assets pledged  the level of assets available for sale  additional borrowing capacity and other factors 
management does not anticipate any negative impact to its liquidity from its pledging activities 
another source of funding for the company is capital market funds  which includes common stock  preferred stock  convertible debentures  retained earnings and long term debt qualifying as regulatory capital 
each of the company s sources of liquidity is vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan and security payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan and security prepayments and calls  and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by general market interest rates and other unforeseen market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow at attractive rates is affected by its financial condition and other market conditions 
management expects that the company has and will have sources of liquidity to meet any expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
since all company transactions are denominated in us dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposures  the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
if more liabilities than assets reprice in a given period a liability sensitive position or negative gap  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in liability rates 
if interest rates decline  such positions will generally benefit net interest income 
alternatively  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities in a given period an asset sensitive position or positive gap  a decline in market rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
excessive levels of interest rate risk can result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  effective risk management techniques that maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
the company has no financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
federal funds  both purchases and sales  on which rates change daily  and loans and deposits tied to certain indices  such as the prime rate and federal discount rate  are the most market sensitive and have the most stable fair values 
the least sensitive instruments include long term fixed rate loans and securities and fixed rate savings deposits  which have the least stable fair value 
on those types falling between these extremes  the management of maturity distributions is as important as the balances maintained 
management of maturity distributions involve the matching of interest rate maturities  as well as principal maturities  and is a key determinant of net interest income 
in periods of rapidly changing interest rates  an imbalance gap between the rate sensitive assets and liabilities can cause major fluctuations in net interest income and in earnings 
establishing patterns of sensitivity which will enhance future growth regardless of frequent shifts in the market conditions is one of the objectives of the company s asset liability management strategy 
evaluating the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is the responsibility of alsc and includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and asset quality 
the company uses the simulation analysis to estimate the effect that specific movements in interest rates would have on net interest income 
this analysis incorporates management assumptions about the levels of future balance sheet trends  different patterns of interest rate movements  and changing relationships between interest rates ie basis risk 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
for a given level of market interest rate changes  the simulation can consider the impact of the varying behavior of cash flows from principal prepayments on the loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities  call activities on investment securities  balance changes on non contractual maturity deposit products demand deposits  checking with interest  money market and savings accounts  and embedded option risk by taking into account the effects of interest rate caps and floors 
the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is not integrated into the simulation analysis 
the company can assess the results of the simulation and  if necessary  implement suitable strategies to adjust the structure of its assets and liabilities to reduce potential unacceptable risks to net interest income 
the simulation analysis at december  shows the company s net interest income increasing slightly if rates rise and decreasing slightly if rates fall 
the company s policy limit on interest rate risk is that if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease basis points from current rates  the percentage change in estimated net interest income for the subsequent month measurement period should not decline by more than percent 
net interest income is forecasted using various interest rate scenarios that management believes are reasonably likely to impact the company s financial condition 
a base case scenario  in which current interest rates remain stable  is used for comparison to other 
table of contents scenario simulations 
the table below illustrates the estimated exposures under a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario calculated as a percentage change in estimated net interest income from the base case scenario  assuming a gradual shift in interest rates for the next month measurement period  beginning december  and percentage change percentage change in estimated in estimated net interest net interest income from income from gradual change in interest rates december  december  basis points basis points beginning on march   a basis point downward change was substituted for the basis point downward scenario previously used  as management believes that a basis point downward change is not a meaningful analysis in light of current interest rate levels 
the percentage change in estimated net income in the and basis points scenario is within the company s policy limits 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  there are certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented 
actual results may differ significantly from simulated results should market conditions and management strategies  among other factors  vary from the assumptions used in the analysis 
the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react the same to changes in interest rates  but  in reality  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
specific types of financial instruments may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while other types of financial instruments may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  other assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and securities and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in the simulation 
one way to minimize interest rate risk is to maintain a balanced or matched interest rate sensitivity position 
however  profits are not always maximized by matched funding 
to increase net interest earnings  the company selectively mismatches asset and liability repricing to take advantage of short term interest rate movements and the shape of the us treasury yield curve 
the magnitude of the mismatch depends on a careful assessment of the risks presented by forecasted interest rate movements 
the risk inherent in such a mismatch  or gap  is that interest rates may not move as anticipated 
interest rate risk exposure is reviewed in quarterly meetings in which guidelines are established for the following quarter and the longer term exposure 
the structural interest rate mismatch is reviewed periodically by alsc and management 
the company also prepares a static gap analysis 
balance sheet items are appropriately categorized by contractual maturity  expected average lives for mortgage backed securities  or repricing dates  with prime rate indexed loans and certificates of deposit 
checking with interest accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and other borrowings constitute the bulk of the floating rate category 
the determination of the interest rate sensitivity of non contractual items is arrived at in a subjective fashion 
savings accounts are viewed as a relatively stable source of funds and are therefore classified as intermediate funds 
at december   the static gap showed a positive cumulative gap of million in the one day to one year repricing period  as compared to a positive cumulative gap of million at december  the change in the cumulative static gap between december  and december  reflects the results of the company s efforts to reposition its portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates and changes to the shape of the yield curve 
management believes that this strategy has enabled the company to be well positioned for the next cycle of interest rate changes and to address conditions which may arise as a result of the current financial crisis
