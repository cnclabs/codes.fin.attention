item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this annual rep ort on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements  that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology  and we design  construct  and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 
in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossil fuel based peak electricity generation  we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing  balance of system bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules  such as inverters  mounting hardware  grid interconnection equ ipment  wiring and other devices  and installation labor costs  project development costs  and the cost of capital 
first  with respect to our module manufacturing costs  our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world  based on publicly available information 
in  our total average manufacturing costs were per watt  which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput  lower material costs  and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
second  by continuing to improve conversion efficiency  leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms  and accelerate installation time  we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs  which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utility scale pv solar power system 
third  with respect to project development costs  we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs  and to accelerate lead time to electricity generation 
finally  we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position  including our balance sheet and credit profile  together with our increasing solar power system operating experience  will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems  thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering th e cost of electricity generated by solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 
we believe that combining our reliable  low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity  accelerate the adoption of our tec hnology in large scale systems  identify and break constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets  and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean  affordable solar electricity 
we operate our business in two segments 
our components segment designs  manufactures  and sells solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators 
through our systems segment  we have the capability to provide a complete pv solar power system  using our solar modules  for utility scale or large commercial systems 
providing a complete pv solar power system includes project development  engineering  procurement  and construction epc  operating and maintenance o m se rvices  when applicable  and project finance  when required 
we view the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability  return on net assets  and cash throughput 
we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput for our components business with the objective of achieving break even results before income taxes for our systems segment

historically  our fiscal quarters ended on the saturday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter 
in july  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year from a or week fiscal year to a calendar year 
this change to the calendar year cycle became effective as of the end of the fiscal year 
as a result  our fiscal year  which began on december   ended on december  instead of december  in addition  effective january   our fiscal quarters will also coincide with calendar quarters 
all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   and all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december  manufacturing capacity as of december   we operated production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately gw based on the average per line run rate for the fourth quarter of at our existing plants at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg  ohio  frankfurt oder  germany  and kulim  malaysia 
we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to production lines including our previously announced line plants in vietnam and the united states by the end of  with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately gw based on the average per line run rate for the fourth quarter of at our existing plants 
market overview in addressing a growing global demand for pv solar electricity  we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics  market requirements  and distribution channels 
in subsidized fit markets  such as germany  we have historically sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers  system integrators  and independent power producers 
in other markets  such as the united states  the demand for solar has been primarily driven by state level renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power 
to meet the needs of these markets and enable bos cost reductions  we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a low cost turn key utility scale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility end users 
our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to inc rease module throughput  drive cost reduction across the value chain  identify and break constraints to sustainable markets  and to deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and end users 
with our fully integrated systems business  we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal  which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand 
we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity  and in the long term  we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 
net sales for the year ended december  were primarily driven by revenue recognition on several utility scale solar power projects in north america and strong european installations  primarily in germany  france  and italy 
net sales from german customers resulted from a combination of demand in advance of further german fit reductions taking effect on july   october   and at the beginning of  customer participation in our rebate program  and improving project finance and overall corporate finance conditions 
in light of strong solar growth  the major european governments are currently s eeking to balance subsidy costs with their commitment to the eu directive goal of a share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by governments in germany  france  and italy are in the process of evaluating additional changes to their fit structures 
the german government is expected to adopt a partial acceleration of the january fit digression to mid in germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  a mid year fit decrease as was effected in  if enacted  could contribute to a short term pull in of demand  but carries the potential for tighter economics in the second half of as the solar industry adjusts to lower fit levels  which may negatively affect long term demand and price levels for pv products in germany 
see item business support programs for a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs in our core and target markets 
in light of continually evolving fit structures in our core european markets  it is uncertain whether there will be sufficient market demand to absorb industry wide module supply without significant inventory build up or price reductions 
we plan to mitigate this uncertainty in part by continuing to use our north american utility scale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in europe and elsewhere 
during  we continued to expand into certain key transition markets  such as the united states  within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and which could ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission group solar project development pipeline consisting of utility scale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwestern united states 
in july  we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power  llc  another leading developer of utility scale solar projects in the southwe stern united states 
this transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and supports our expansion in the us utility scale market 
for instance  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell to nrg energy  inc the mw ac agua caliente solar project  which was part of the next light pipeline of projects 
upon its completion  agua caliente is expected to be the largest operational pv solar plant in the world 
in the pv module segment  we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems 
solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product per formance attributes  including reliability and module cost per watt  and  with respect to solar power systems  return on equity roe and levelized cost of electricity lcoe  meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system life 
the ability to expand manufacturing capacity quickly is another source of differentiation among solar module manufacturers  and certain of our competitors may have a faster response time to capacity expansion than we do and or an ability to expand capacity in finer increments than we can 
we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry  based on publicly available information  as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from during to during this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe 
our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process  as opposed to a batch process  our scale  and our operational excellence 
in addition  our modules use approxim ately of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 
the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules 
the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels 
although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer  we estimate  based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors  that a per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease  respectively  our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately to over time 
given the l ower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules  there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
thus  to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe  our modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules 
during  we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by from our cost per watt in and continued to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes  there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all 
any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression  a decline in the average selling prices of our solar modules  erosion in our market share for modules  a decrease in the rate of revenue growth  and or a decline in overall revenues 
we have taken  and continue to take  several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures  including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core market segments to drive module volumes  continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap  and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 
as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets  we can offer value beyond the pv module  reduce our exposure to module only competition  and provide comprehensive utility scale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs 
thus  our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules 
finally  we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings  including epc capabilities and o m services  in order to enh ance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 
financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
net sales components business currently  the majority of our net sales are generated from the sale of solar modules 
we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power 
during  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers  system integrators  and operators headquartered in germany  italy  france  spain  and the united states  which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own  operate  or sell 
as of decemb er   we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of with fourteen solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union 
these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from through and  therefore  will significantly affe ct our overall financial performance 
we have the right to terminate certain supply contracts upon months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred 
in addition  our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume 
these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers 
in the case of a late delivery  certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue 
if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments  our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 
our sales prices under the supply contracts are denominated in euro  exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in euro and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
in the past we have amended pricing and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive  and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules 
during the year ended december   we amended our supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provided a price rebate to these customers for solar modules purchased from us 
the intent of this program was to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core german market and to adjust  for eligible customers  the sales price which was documented in framework agreements entered into several years ago in light of market conditions 
the rebate program is offered for a defined period  during which customers may apply and claim such rebate 
the most recent rebate offering  for all solar modules sold through november   will terminate on february  beginning march   we will offer customers a modified rebate program  including applicability to certain european geographic areas in addition to germany 
the rebate amounts continue to be established so as to enable the sell through of our products at competitive prices 
the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in certain geographic areas 
customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program 
as of december  and december   we have experienced approximately and participation in this program by eligible customers  respectively 
the lower customer participation at december  was primarily due to the expiration of the current rebate offering period in february we account for these rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and  therefore  as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale and recognize a contra asset within accounts receivable trade  net 
no rebates granted under this prog ram can be claimed for cash  instead  rebates may only be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances 
during  we extended rebates to customers in the amount of million million at the average exchange rate of 
at december   we had e uro  million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of of rebate claims accrued  which reduced our accounts receivable accordingly 
during the year ended december   we extended rebates to customers in the amount of million million at an average exchange rate of 
at december   we had million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of of rebate claims accrued  which reduced our accounts receivable accordingly 
we also enter into one time module sales agreements with customers for specific projects 
under our customer contracts  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 
during  the principal customers of our components business were edf en development  juwi solar gmbh  and phoenix solar ag 
during  each of these three cu stomers individually accounted for between and of our components segment s net sales 
all of our other customers individually accounted for less than of our net sales during systems business through our fully integrated systems business  we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules  which may include project development  epc services  o m services  when applicable  and project finance  when required 
in july  we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power  llc  a leading developer of utility scale solar projects in the southwestern united states 
this transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and supports our expansion in the us utility scale power market 
net sales from our systems segment may include the followi ng types of transactions transaction description engineer and procure ep contract design for a customer of a solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all bos componen ts from third party suppliers

sale of project assets sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development 
this generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits  land or land rights  and or power off take agreements 
operating and maintenance o m agreement typically a fixed price long term services agreement 
net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors  including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards  economic incentives such as european fits  the us federal investment tax credit  grants in lieu of tax credits under section of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  us department of energy loan guarantees  or accelerated depreciation  and other pv system demand drivers 
net sales from our systems business during resulted primarily from revenue recognition for utility scale solar power projects in north america and europe 
during  net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states a nd canada

our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety  quality and production control  and procurement costs 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 
we implemented a program in to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use 
under our solar module collection and recycling program  we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules 
in the agreement  we commit  at our expense  to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules  or recycled to recover some of the raw materials 
in return  the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of 
the owner is also responsible for disassem bling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide 
at the time we sell a solar module  we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation 
we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation  which we classify within selling  general and administrative expense 
overall  we expect our cost of sales per watt to continue to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in sellable watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per production line  continued geographic expansion into lower cost manufacturing regions  and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 
systems business within our systems business  project related costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters  electrical and mounting hardware  project management and engineering costs  and installation labor costs  site specific costs  and development costs including transmission upgrade costs  interconnection fees  and permitting costs 
as further described in note segment and geographical information  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met  we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business 
therefore  the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time 
deferred project costs represent i costs that we capitalize for arrangements that we account for as real estate transactions after we have entered into a definitive sales arrangement  but before we have met the criteria to recognize the sale as revenue  ii recoverable pre contract costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts prior to entering into a definitive sales agreement or  iii costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts after we have signed a definitive sales agreement  but before the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred project costs capitalized on our balance sheet at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our module average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  the existence and effectiveness of subsidies and other economic incentives  market mix  our manufacturing costs  bos costs  project development costs  the effective utilization of our production facilities  and the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached 
gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures  and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our supply contracts  which specify our sales price per watt 
gross profit margin is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses 
our systems business generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the pass through nature of certain bos components procured from third parties 
gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules  which we include in the gross profit of our components business 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs  the cost of products  materials  and outside services used in our process  and product research and development activities 
we acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and reco rd the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 
we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity 
over time  we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
currently  the majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 
we report our research and development expense net of grant funding 
during the ye ars ended december  and december   we did not receive any grant funding 
we received million of grant funding during the year ended december  that we applied towards our research and development programs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expenses  and other selling expenses 
we expect these expenses to increase in the near term  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems  and implement the financial reporting  compliance  and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company 
over time  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 
our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions  such as accounting  legal  finance  project finance  human resources  procurement  and marketing 
costs for such functions are recorded and included within selling  general and administrative costs for our systems segment 
our corporate key functions consist primarily of company wide corporate tax  corporate treasury  corporate accounting finance  corporate legal  investor relations  corporate communications  and executive management functions 
currently our components business benefits the most from these functions and  therefore  we have allocated these costs to this segment as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs  and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we incur red production start up expense of million during the year ended december  in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center 
we incurred production start up expense of million during the year ended december  related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion 
production start up expense for the year ended december  was million and related to our eight line malaysian  four line german  one line perrysburg  ohio  and two line blanquefort  france manufacturing expansions  including legal  regulatory  and personnel costs 
in general  we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
over time  we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of sca le 
production start up expense is attributable to our components segment 
foreign currency loss gain foreign currency loss gain consists of losses and gains resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash and investments 
interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  is incurred on various debt financings 
we capitalize interest expense into our property  plant and equipment  project assets  and deferred project costs 
income tax expense income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  principally the united states  germany  and malaysia 
the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately and  respectively 
in malaysia  we have been granted a long term tax holiday  scheduled to expire in  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience  our forecasts  and other available information  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  are as follows accrued solar module collection and recycling liability 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules t hat we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives 
we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center  the material  labor  and capital costs of the recycling process  and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes  about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled  and about the timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling 
in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 
at december   our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was million 
a decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by million  to million  a increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by million  to million 
product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 
we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their power output rating during the following years 
in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties  we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or  under the power output warranty  providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers 
we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales  using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites  and in house testing 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  income taxes 
once established  we a djust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment  or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities  if any 
in preparing our consolidated financial statemen ts  we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period  we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 
we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
we have concluded that  except for the decision t o strategically repatriate approximately million during  all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states 
if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes  additional taxes may be required to be accrued 
see note income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and  if necessary  we would record any impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach of valuation  which considers values of comparable businesses  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 
we reported million of goodwill at december   which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy  llc  optisolar inc  and nextlight renewable power  llc 
asc requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  or sooner  if facts or circumstances between scheduled annual tests indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill might be less than its carrying value 
currently our operating segments and reporting units are identical 
we determine the fair value for our reporting units referring to the price that would be received to sell the unit as whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for the assessment of goodwill related to our systems business  we believe that a typical market participant for the sale of our systems reporting unit would be a solar module manufacturer seeking to acquire a systems business with a large pipeline of utility scale solar power plant projects  with the intent that these projects would provide a captive outlet for additional future solar module production 
therefore  we model the systems reporting unit future performance for purposes of applying the income method of fair value measurement to include some of the profitability associated with the solar module element of the solar power plants that it builds and sells 
we performed our goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter of the years ended december  and december  and determined that the fair value of each of our individual reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired

the million increase in manufacturing overhead costs for was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a million increase in share based compensation expense  a million increase in depreciation and equipment expenses  a million increase in facility related expenses  and a million increase in incremental systems costs 
each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased production capacity resulting from the full ramp of our malaysian manufacturing center  expansion of our perrysburg  ohio plant  and ramp of our systems business 
the net increase in other costs for includes million related to an increase in estimated expenses for certain module replacement efforts beyond normal warranty 
during the period fr om june to june  a manufacturing excursion occurred affecting less than of the total product manufactured within the period 
the excursion could result in possible premature power loss in the affected modules 
the root cause was identified and subsequently mitigated in june on going testing confirms that the corrective actions taken are effective 
we have been working directly with impacted customers to replace the affected modules and these efforts are well underway and  in some cases  complete 
some of these efforts go beyond our normal warranty coverage 
accordingly  we accrued additional expenses of million in and million in total to date to cover the replacement of the anticipated affected module population in the field 
such amounts include million in expenses accrued during the fourth fiscal quarter of  reflecting updated best estimates of the total replacement costs  based on our field data and execution to date of the module replacement program

in the past  most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts 
for example  our supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
for the years ended december   december   and december   a change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by million  million  and million  respectively 
for our manufacturing operations in germany and malaysia  and those under construction in vietnam  and blanquefort  france many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are or will be denominated in the local currency 
our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure  transaction exposure  and earnings translation exposure 
cash flow exposure we expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  that will be denominated in currencies other than the component functional currency 
our primary cash flow exposures are customer collections and vendor payments 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
accordingly  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows 
these foreign exchange contracts qualified for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled 
most of our german plant s operating expenses are denominated in euros  creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales 
during  we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro 
as of december   the unrealized loss on these contracts was million and the total notional value of the contracts was eur o  million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 
the weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was at december  
transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables  investments  accounts payable  debt  solar module collection and recycling liabilities  and inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the component functional currency 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to he dge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities 
as of december   the total unrealized gain on our foreign exchange forward contracts was million 
these contracts have maturities of less than three months 
as of december   the notional values of our foreign exchange forward contracts were as follows notional amounts and us dollar equivalents in millions balance sheet close rate on transaction currency notional amount us equivalent december  purchase euro sell euro purchase malaysian ringgit myr myr sell malaysian ringgit myr myr purchase japanese yen jpy  jpy sell japanese yen jpy jpy purchase canadian dollar cad cad sell canadian dollar cad cad if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  japanese yen  and canadian dollar  the impact on our income before income taxes during the years ended december  and december  would have been million unfavorable and million favorable  respectively 
if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro and malaysian ringgit  the adverse impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december  would have been million 
earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 
these contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and ot her income  net 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time  but may do so in the future 
in the past  currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by million  million  and million in the years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations  we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system 
although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately years  end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation 
as a result  many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures 
an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system 
this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
we use interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain of our debt instruments  we do not use such swap agreements for speculative or trading purposes 
during may  we entered into a euro denominated credit facility t o finance some of the equipment cost for our malaysian manufacturing center 
the loans under the fixed rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 
the loans under the floating rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus a margin of 
on may   we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge a portion of the floating rate loans under our malaysian credit facility  which became effective on september  with a notional value of million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of and pursuant to which we are entitled to receive the six month floating euribor  and required to pay a fixed rate of 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled pri ncipal payments on the underlying hedged debt 
as of december   the notional value of this interest rate swap contract was million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 
this de rivative instrument qualifies for accounting as a cash flow hedge in accordance with asc and we designated it as such 
we determined that our interest rate swap contract was highly effective as a cash flow hedge at december  in addition  we invest in debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
t his means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  marketable securities  and investments in a variety of securities 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  federal and foreign agency debt  foreign governme nt obligations  and supranational debt 
commodity and component risk we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials  components  and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules 
also  some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier 
we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process 
in some cases  we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components  but these arrangements can be of shorter duration than the term of our supply contracts with our customers 
as a result  we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules 
in addition  a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices and or a disruption in our manufacturing process 
since our selling price under our supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms  we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products  and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  investments  trade accounts receivable  interest rate swap contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest rate swap contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions
