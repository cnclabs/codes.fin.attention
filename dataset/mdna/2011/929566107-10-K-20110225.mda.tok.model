item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen the company 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility and contractual commitments 
we also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
executive summary the year ending december  was extremely challenging for the trailer industry as the factors negatively impacting demand for new trailers became more intense and pervasive across the united states 
according to the act research company  llc act estimates  total trailer industry shipments in were approximately  or a decline of from the  trailers shipped in and more than lower than the  trailers shipped for the year ended december  total demand for trailers in dropped to levels the industry has not seen since with dry van demand at its lowest levels since this reflected the weakness of truck freight  which trended down since the latter part of as a result of general economic conditions and  more particularly  declines in new home construction and the automotive industry 
as a result of these significant declines within the trailer industry  the company s revenues  gross profits  financial position and liquidity for were all negatively impacted 
in light of these economic conditions and the decline in the our operating results and financial condition  in july  we issued million of preferred stock and warrants to trailer investments  llc trailer investments and amended our revolving credit facility as discussed in further details under the liquidity and capital resources section below 
while the company has experienced historically low demand for trailers in  the overall trailer market has significantly improved from  reflecting the beginning of a recovery within the trailer industry 
as the year progressed  several of the economic indicators within the broader manufacturing environment and  more specifically  the trailer and freight industry showed signs of improvement 
according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry shipments for were up from to approximately  trailers in by product line  act estimates that the demand for dry vans  the largest segment within the trailer industry  doubled from to approximately  trailers in furthermore  our backlog of orders at december  was million  up from our backlog at december  these positive trends  coupled with our previously enacted cost actions and operational enhancement initiatives  yielded significant improvements to both revenue and gross profit as compared to the previous years 
gross profit levels showed continuous improvements throughout due primarily to increases in new trailer volumes and lower overhead costs per unit as compared to the previous year 
as the outlook within the trailer industry continued to show signs of a recovery  in may we were able to successfully close on a public offering of our common stock consisting of  shares sold by us and  shares sold by trailer investments 
net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all of the preferred stock and to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
furthermore  in september trailer investments exercised in full the remaining  warrants in an underwritten public offering 
as a result of these successful offerings  an improved trailer market and the various cash management actions implemented during the economic downturn  we were able to make significant improvements to our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity 
as of december   our liquidity position totaled million  an increase of over million from the previous year 
we expect continued improvements in the overall trailer market for as compared to in fact  recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr associates ftr  indicate shipment levels to increase in each of the next three years and exceeding  trailers for each of the years through furthermore  act is currently estimating levels to be approximately  trailers  or an increase of while ftr anticipates a increase in new trailers for as compared to this healthier demand environment reinforces our belief that the recovery of the industry is well under way and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected improvement in overall demand 
in addition  while will remain a very price competitive environment  we do anticipate seeing pricing power improve as trailer order demand and confidence increases throughout the year and into we are also not relying solely on volume recovery within the trailer industry to improve operations and profitability 
we intend to continue focus on the diversification of the product offering through our duraplate product group and leveraging our intellectual and physical assets for opportunities of organic growth 
we will also continue to try to optimize our cost structure to improve results  including the consolidation of our flatbed manufacturing facilities completed in operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and continuous improvement 
our objective of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we continually focus on reducing the severity and frequency of workplace injuries in order to minimize our workers compensation costs 
in addition  we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system at our lafayette operations 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield 
process yield is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
as with previous years  the expectations of the highest quality product continue to increase while maintaining process yield performance and reducing rework 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
early life cycle warranty claims are trended for performance monitoring and have shown a steady improvement from an average of approximately claims per trailers in to claims per trailers in this information is utilized  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts we continue to realize improved quality which has resulted in sustained decreases in warranty payments over the past eight years 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line cycle time speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs 
during the past couple of years  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production 
we also established a central warehousing and distribution center to improve material flow  inventory levels and inventory accuracy within our supply chain 
the successful implementation of these productivity enhancements supported our ability to effectively manage the increases in trailer volumes realized in and anticipated in the future as compared to the previous year 
cost reduction 
we believe continuous improvement is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus 
in  we trained and deployed several team focused groups through the successful integration of a wabash integrated network win program which empowered the manufacturing workforce to improve their departments through continuous improvement activities in the areas throughout our company  including safety  quality  inventory management  maintenance and cost reduction 
in addition  we were able to successfully complete the consolidation of our platform and dump manufacturing facilities into one location 
these cost reductions  coupled with holding other costs relatively stable throughout  enabled us to significantly lower our overall manufacturing cost per unit 
industry trends truck transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
truck freight tonnage  according to ata statistics  started declining year over year in and remained at depressed levels through however  data shows that freight tonnage increased approximately from the trailer industry generally precedes transportation industry cycles 
the most recently completed cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and reached the bottom in with shipments of approximately  trailers 
according to act  shipments in amounted to approximately  trailers 
as the trailer industry continues to recover  act is estimating demand within the trailer industry to increase in each of the next years to approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  these increases in demand for trailers are being driven by improvements within the dry van segment  our largest product line 
act is forecasting total dry van market to grow from approximately  trailers in to   and  trailers in  and  respectively  representing year over year increases of  and  respectively 
our view is generally consistent with that of act 
age of trailer fleets 
the average age of fleets has increased during the recent industry downturn 
according to act  the average age of dry and refrigerated vans has continued to increase and has reached historic highs in of approximately years and years  respectively 
the increase in age of trailers suggests an increase in replacement demand over the next several years 
new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placements ranged from approximately  to  trailers in each quarter of  a significant improvement from approximately  to  trailers in each quarter in total orders in were approximately  trailers  a increase from approximately  trailers ordered in  driven by dry van orders  the largest segment of the trailer industry  increasing year over year by approximately 
transportation regulations and legislation 
there are several different topics within both federal and state government regulations and legislation that are expected to have an impact on trailer demand  including the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa is currently looking at ways to improve the overall truck safety standards  particularly by implementing comprehensive safety analysis csa in december csa is considered a comprehensive driver and fleet rating system that will measure both the freight carriers and its drivers on several safety related criteria  including driver safety  equipment maintenance and overall condition of trailers 
this system is expected to drive increased awareness and action by carriers as government enforcement is expected to begin by midyear current industry estimates indicate csa could make to of drivers ineligible to operate commercial equipment due to not meeting minimum safety standards 
the fmcsa issued in december a preliminary proposal for rule changes in regard to truck driver hours of service rules with final rules to be published in february and enforcement currently scheduled to begin by july the proposed rule changes include reductions in the driver hours per day requirement from the current hours to hours 
additionally  driver re start requirements are expected to be lengthened from the current hours to as much as hours 
current estimates indicate these actions could lead to productivity losses of approximately to 
this ruling increases the potential that a carrier s drop and hook activities will increase and  therefore  require an increase in trailer to truck ratios across the industry 
the fmcsa also issued in january a proposed rule change requiring the installation and use of electronic on board recorders for over the road trucks and buses which would be used to monitor and enforce the driver hour of service rules 
a final ruling on this proposal is scheduled for june the federal government put forth bills in that would increase the allowable gross vehicle weight of a semi trailer combo from the current  pounds to  pounds 
this gross vehicle weight increase would require the addition of a third axle to existing equipment with the likelihood that many fleets may elect to replace older trailers as opposed to investing in upgrading them with the third axle 
the tax relief act of extended bonus depreciation provisions for and more specifically  corporations can expense and of certain capital investments made during and  respectively 
this extension will be an incentive for many fleets to increase or accelerate their purchase decisions to maximize the tax benefits available 
the california air resource board carb regulations mandate that refrigeration units older than years may no longer operate in california 
as refrigeration units become obsolete  capacity in the refrigerated segment will tighten and the increase in demand for new refrigerated trailers is likely 
other developments 
other developments and potential impacts on the industry include miniaturization of electronic products resulting in increased density of loads could further decrease demand for dry van trailers 
packaging optimization of bulk goods and the efficiency of the packaging around goods may contribute to further decreases in demand for dry van trailers 
trucking company profitability  which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices  freight tonnage volumes  and government regulations  is highly correlated with the overall economy of the us carrier profitability significantly impacts demand for  and the financial ability to purchase  new trailers 
although truck driver shortages have not been a significant problem in the past year  constraints are expected to exacerbate as freight demand increases 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to respond to freight demand pressures 
we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck

material costs were of net sales in compared to in the decrease was the result of utilization of unfavorable fixed price aluminum contracts that we were obligated to fulfill in the prior year  favorable customer and product mix as well as increased production volume  which resulted in favorable quantity discounts 
these decreases were offset by increases in commodity costs during in addition  other manufacturing costs decreased from of net sales in to in the decrease is primarily the result of an  unit increase in new trailer sales as compared to the prior year  which resulted in allocating our fixed overhead costs over more trailers  and the benefit of favorable experience on trailer warranties which expired of million 
retail and distribution segment cost of sales was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales was in compared to in the improvement as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased new trailer and parts and service volumes coupled with inventory valuation reserves on both new and used trailers recognized in the prior year not repeated in the current year

this rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the recognition of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  the effect of a non deductible adjustment to the fair market value of our warrant and the reduction in valuation allowance of million whereby  in january  we filed a claim with the irs for a refund of million for us federal alternative minimum taxes previously paid during the years through as provided under the provisions of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which was signed into law in november as of december   we had a us federal tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire beginning in  if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations under irs rules 
we have various multi state income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which have been recorded as a deferred income tax asset  of approximately million  before valuation allowances 
we also have various us federal income tax credit carryforwards  which will expire beginning in  if unused 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure in july  we entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement with trailer investments pursuant to which trailer investments purchased  shares of series e redeemable preferred stock series e preferred   shares of series f redeemable preferred stock series f preferred  and  shares of series g redeemable preferred stock series g preferred  and together with the series e preferred and the series f preferred  the series e g preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
trailer investments also received a warrant that was exercisable at per share for  newly issued shares of our common stock the warrant representing  on august   the date the warrant was delivered  of our issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares underlying the warrant  subject to upward adjustment to maintain that percentage if currently outstanding options were exercised 
on may   we closed on a public offering of our common stock  par value per share the initial offering  which consisted of  shares of common stock sold by us and  shares of common stock sold by trailer investments as a selling stockholder  each at a purchase price of per share 
the shares of common stock sold in the initial offering by trailer investments included  shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares to cover over allotments 
all shares sold by trailer investments were issued upon the partial exercise of the warrant it held and the replacement warrant  as defined below  was issued to trailer investments on may  we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by trailer investments 
we generated proceeds from the initial offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of million and used the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock and to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
from the net proceeds of the initial offering  we redeemed the redemption all outstanding shares of our series e g preferred stock at a liquidation value of  per share  or million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium adjustment of as required under the securities purchase agreement for any redemption made prior to august the series e preferred  series f preferred and series g preferred paid an annual dividend rate of  and  respectively  based on liquidation value 
through the date of the redemption  accrued and unpaid dividends totaled approximately million 
the premium adjustment for early redemption of million was applied to the sum of the liquidation value and accrued and unpaid dividends 
the total redemption price of the series e g preferred stock including all accrued and unpaid dividends was approximately million 
certificates of elimination were filed on september  with the secretary of state of the state of delaware to eliminate from the company s certificate of incorporation all provisions that were set forth in the certificates of designation for the series e g preferred stock 
if a change of control  meaning if more than of the voting power is transferred or acquired by any person other than trailer investments and its affiliates  occurs within months of the date of the redemption by or before may   trailer investments will be entitled to receive an aggregate payment equal to million  representing the difference between what it received in the redemption and what it would have been entitled to receive on the date of the redemption if a change of control had occurred on that date 
also in connection with our initial offering of common stock  we amended the warrant originally issued to trailer investments on august  the warrant  and  as amended  the replacement warrant 
the warrant was modified so that i the warrant would no longer adjust or increase based upon any limitation on our ability to fully utilize our net operating loss nol carryforwards and ii the warrant was increased by a fixed number of  warrant shares in lieu of the market price anti dilution adjustment that would have otherwise applied as a result of the initial offering 
the initial offering of common stock included  shares sold by trailer investments pursuant to a partial exercise of the warrant 
the partial net exercise of the warrant was made by trailer investments via the forfeiture of  shares of common stock under the warrant 
on september   trailer investments sold the replacement warrant to the several underwriters  who exercised the replacement warrant in full and sold the  shares underlying the replacement warrant in an underwritten public offering at a price per share of the second offering 
we did not offer or sell any shares in the second offering nor did we receive any proceeds from the second offering 
the exercise of the replacement warrant was made via the forfeiture of  shares of common stock 
as a result of this offering and the related cashless exercise  the replacement warrant was fully exercised and is no longer outstanding 
pursuant to the terms of the investors rights agreement  trailer investments had significant rights that no longer exist as a result of the consummation of the offering effective september  these rights included the ability to designate five persons for election to the board of directors for so long as trailer investments and its affiliates beneficially owned at least of our outstanding common stock 
on september   we received resignation letters from each of the four board members designated by trailer investments 
as a result of the initial offering and our ability to use the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock and repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  we have been able to reduce our total debt and significantly improve our overall capital structure providing us the additional liquidity necessary to meet working capital requirements as the overall demand in our industry grows 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio was approximately our long term objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements  to fund capital expenditures and to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities 
for we expect to fund operating results  working capital requirements and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations as well as available borrowings 
debt agreements and related amendments concurrent with entering into the securities purchase agreement  in july  we entered into a third amended and restated loan and security agreement the facility with our lenders  effective august   with a maturity date of august  the facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of ours and secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility has a capacity of million  subject to a borrowing base and other discretionary reserves 
the facility amends and restates our previous revolving credit facility  and our lenders waived certain events of default that had occurred under the previous revolving credit facility and waived the right to receive default interest during the time the events of default had continued 
in may  we entered into the consent and amendment no 
to the third amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended facility with our lenders 
the amended facility amends and restates the facility 
the amended facility was entered into to permit the early redemption of our series e g preferred stock and required us to pay down our revolving credit facility by at least million 
the repayment did not reduce our revolving loan commitments 
pursuant to the amended facility  if the availability under our revolving credit facility is less than million at any time before the earlier of august  or the date that monthly financial statements are delivered for the month ending june   we would be required to maintain a varying minimum ebitda and would be restricted in the amount of capital expenditures we could make during such period 
if our availability is less than million thereafter  we would be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio for the month period ending on the last day of the calendar month that ended most recently prior to such time of not less than to in addition  the amended facility modifies our borrowing base by eliminating a million facility reserve while reducing the fixed assets sub limit by million 
the interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility from the date of effectiveness through july  was libor plus or the prime rate of bank of america  na the prime rate plus 
after july   the interest rate is based upon average unused availability and will range between libor plus to or the prime rate plus to 
we are required to pay a monthly unused line fee equal to times the average daily unused availability along with other customary fees and expenses of our agent and lenders 
all interest and fees are paid monthly 
our revolving credit facility contains customary representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  restrictions on mergers  dissolutions  acquisitions  indebtedness  affiliate transactions  the occurrence of liens  payments of subordinated indebtedness  disposition of assets  leases and changes to organizational documents 
our revolving credit facility contains customary events of default including  without limitation  failure to pay obligations when due under the facility  false and misleading representations  breaches of covenants subject in some instances to cure and grace periods  defaults on certain other indebtedness  the occurrence of certain uninsured losses  business disruptions for a period of time that materially adversely affects the capacity to continue business on a profitable basis  changes of control and the incurrence of certain judgments that are not stayed  released or discharged within days 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the amended facility 
cash flow cash used in operating activities amounted to million in compared to million in the use of cash from operating activities for the current year was primarily the result of a million increase in our working capital offset slightly by million of net income  adjusted for various non cash activities  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and changes in the fair value of our warrant 
changes in working capital for the current year can be attributed to the increased production levels in comparison to the previous year and the related increases in purchasing activities have resulted in higher working capital requirements 
changes in key working capital accounts for compared to the prior year are summarized below in millions change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and accrued liabilities accounts receivable increased by million in as compared to a million decrease in days sales outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  improved to approximately days in compared to days in due to timing of collections 
the increase in accounts receivable for was primarily the result of the timing of shipments as trailer demands increased throughout the current year resulting in an increase in our consolidated net sales as compared to the prior year 
inventory increased million during compared to a decrease of million in the increase in inventory for was due to higher new trailer inventories and raw materials resulting from increased order levels for as compared to despite the increased inventory levels  our inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns per year  improved to approximately times in as compared to times in due to our ability to manage inventory levels as the overall demand for trailers increased 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million in compared to a decrease of million in the increase in the current year was also due primarily to higher production levels throughout as compared to the previous year 
days payable outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a payable is outstanding  was reduced to days for compared to days for due primarily to the timing of shipments relative to our production levels 
investing activities provided less than million during compared to million used in the uses of cash from investing activities for both the and periods have been limited to capital spending for required replacement projects and other cost reduction initiatives 
the current year period uses were offset by the proceeds received from the sale of our transcraft production facilities located in anna  illinois and mt 
sterling  kentucky 
financing activities provided million during primarily as a result of closing the initial offering of our common stock on may  as well as an increase in our borrowings against our revolving credit facility due to higher working capital requirements necessary to fund operational activities 
we generated proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of million from the initial offering and used it to redeem all of our outstanding preferred stock and repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility 
as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  amounted to million  an improvement of million from december  total debt and capital lease obligations amounted to approximately million as of december  as a result of closing on the initial offering of our common stock on may  and concurrent with our redemption of all outstanding series e g preferred stock  as described in the capital structure section above  we believe our liquidity is adequate to meet our expected operating results  working capital needs and capital expenditures for in light of the uncertain market and economic conditions  we aggressively managed our cost structure  capital expenditures and cash position throughout the past several years 
during and  we implemented various cost reduction actions resulting in decreases of overhead and operating costs  including reductions in hourly and salary headcount and temporary reductions in compensation and benefits 
in addition  we have optimized our operations through plant  assembly line and warehouse consolidation projects 
as we continue to see improvements to both the overall the trailer industry as well as our operating performance metrics during  management expects to begin to reinstate some of the temporary cost reduction initiatives previously implemented 
capital expenditures capital spending for amounted to approximately million as our efforts to manage cash flows and enhance liquidity limited our capital expenditures to required replacement projects and cost reduction initiatives 
we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to approximately million in in order to support growth and improvement initiatives within our facilities 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we had approximately million in operating lease commitments 
we did not enter into any material off balance sheet debt or operating lease transactions during the year 
outlook the demand environment for trailers is improving  as evidenced by the increases in our new trailer shipments and backlog as well as trailer industry forecasts for the upcoming years 
according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry shipments for are expected to be up from to approximately  trailers 
by product type  act is expecting the dry van market to lead the industry with increases of approximately in compared to and total van trailer shipments will be up approximately in compared to act is forecasting that platform trailer shipments will increase approximately and dump trailer shipments will increase approximately in for  act estimates that shipments will grow approximately to a total of  trailers with the dry van segment leading the industry with shipments increasing approximately to a total of  dry van trailers 
downside concerns for relate to continued issues with the global economy  unemployment  tight credit markets  as well as depressed housing and construction related markets in the us taking into consideration recent economic and industry forecasts  as well as discussions with customers and suppliers  management expects demand for new trailers to improve as we move through and the economy continues to improve 
we believe we are well positioned for long term growth in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the mid market carriers 
while our expectations for industry volumes are generally in line with those of act  our challenges as we proceed into  a period of higher demand  will primarily relate to pricing of new trailers and rising commodity costs 
raw material and component costs have risen and remain volatile as overall demand will drive an increase in prices as the economy improves 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition in order to return to profitability 
based on industry forecasts  conversations with our customers regarding their current requirements and our existing backlog of orders  we estimate that for the full year our total new trailers sold will be between  and  an increase from of approximately to

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate or changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of trailers sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and other assets valuation of long lived assets we are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes additional paid in capital stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of all stock awards we grant 
we use a binomial valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock awards 
we feel the binomial model provides the most accurate estimate of fair value 
risk free interest rate historical volatility dividend yield expected term in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our new and used inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements during  there were no new accounting pronouncements that had or are expected to have a material impact to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had million of floating rate debt outstanding under our revolving facility 
a hypothetical basis point change in the floating interest rate from the current level would result in a corresponding million change in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes
