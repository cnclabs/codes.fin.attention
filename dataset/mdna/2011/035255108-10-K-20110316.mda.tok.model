management overview anika therapeutics  inc anika  and together  with its subsidiaries  the company develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products for tissue protection  healing  and repair 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
anika acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of fab on december  from fidia farmaceutici spa fidia  a privately held italian corporation  for a purchase price consisting of million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock valued at million based on the closing stock price of per share 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition 
fab has over products currently commercialized  primarily in europe 
these products are also all made from hyaluronic acid  and based on two technologies hyaff  which is a solid form of ha  and acp gel  an autocross linked polymer of ha 
both technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents 
with the acquisition of fab  the company now offers therapeutic products in the following areas anika fab orthobiologics x x dermal advanced wound care x aesthetic dermatology x ophthalmic x surgical anti adhesion x x ear  nose and throat care ent x veterinary x orthobiologics anika s orthobiologics business contributed to our product revenue in the year ended december  this includes fab s products which added  to orthobiologics revenue in our orthobiologics products consist of joint health and orthopedic products 
joint health products include orthovisc  orthovisc mini  and monovisc 
orthovisc is available in the us  canada  and some international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  and in europe for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all joints 
orthovisc mini is available in europe and is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints 
monovisc is our single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated fo r all joints in europe  and for the knee in turkey and canada 
orthovisc mini  and monovisc are our two newest joint health products and became available in certain international markets during the second quarter of anika has marketed orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  internationally since through various distribution agreements 
international sales of orthovisc contributed of product revenue for the year ended december  our strategy is to continue to add new products  to expand the indications for usage of these products  and to add additional countries to our distribution network 
the joint health area has been the fastest growing area for the company  growing from of our product revenue in to of our product revenue in we continue to seek new distribution partnerships around the world and we expect total joint health product sales to increase in compared to with the acquisition of fab  we now offer several orthopedic products used in connection with regenerative medicine 
the products currently available in europe  include hyalograft c autograft for cartilage regeneration  hyalofast  a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  hyalonect  a woven gauze used as a graft wrap  and hyaloss  hyaff fibers used to mix blood bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration 
we also offer hyaloglide  an acp gel used in tenolysis treatment  but with potential for flexor tendon adhesion prevention  and in the shoulder for adhesive capsulitis with additional clinical data 
these products are commercialized directly in italy  and through a network of distributors  primarily in europe  the middle east  argentina  and korea 
anika believes that the us m arket offers excellent expansion potential to increase revenue  and this will continue to be a major focus area for the company

these products are commercialized directly in italy  and through a network of dist ributors  primarily in europe  the middle east  argentina  and korea 
several of the products are also approved for sale in the united states  and the company is exploring distribution opportunities 
our aesthetic dermatology business is designed as a family of products for facial wrinkles and scar remediation  and is intended to supplant collagen based products and to compete with other ha based products currently on the market 
our initial aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary chemically modified  cross linked ha  and is approved in europe  canada  the us  korea  and certain countries in south america 
internationally  this product is marketed under the elevess name 
this product has been marketed in the us under the name of hydrelletm 
coapt systems  inc coapt began selling hydrelletm in the third quarter of under a distribution agreement granting coapt an exclusive and non transferable right to market hydrelle in the united states 
on july  we were notified by coapt that it had filed for an assignment for the benefit of creditors under the laws of the state of california 
the company s distribution agreement with coapt was subsequently terminated 
the company plans to directly distribute hydrelletm in the interim while it reviews its franchise strategy 
we recorded  and  of aesthetic dermatology revenue in and  respectively  with reve nue in primarily derived from sales to coapt 
ophthalmic our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
for the year ended december   sales of ophthalmic products contributed of our product revenue  of which represents sales to bausch lomb 
anika manufactures the amvisc product line for bausch lomb under the terms of a supply agreement that expired on december  the b l agreement for viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
effective january   the parties entered into a non exclusive  two year contract intended to transition the manufacture of amvisc and amvisc plus to an alternative  recently acquired low cost supplier to b l 
under the b l agreement  the company was restricted in its ability to commercialize viscoelastic products to only exi sting customers staar surgical company and hoya surgical optics  inc 
that restriction has now expired and the company is free to market its own viscoelastic product called anikavisc 
b l accounted for of product revenue for the year ended  but is expected to be significantly lower in under the new transition contract 
operating margins under the b l agreement were low  and the company expects to see margin improvement through commercialization of its new anikavisc product 
there can be no assurance that anikavisc will be successfully sold or that it will generate any profit for the company 
see item a 
risk factors 
surgical our surgical group consists of products used to prevent surgical adhesions  and to treat ent disorders 
for the year ended december   sales of surgical products contributed of our product revenue  incert  approved for sale in europe and turkey is a chemically modified  cross linked ha barrier gel  for prevention of post surgical adhesions in connection with spinal surgeries such as discectomies with a laminectomy or laminotomy 
incert is currently marketed in four countries 
we see potential for expanded indications for the use of incert  but have made this a secondary goal to the successful launch and expanded distribution of our joint health and advanced wound care products 
there are currently no plans to dist ribute incert in the us hyalobarrier and hyalobarrier endo are also clinically proven post operative adhesion barrier products  approved for abdominal indications 
the products are currently commercialized by fab in europe  the middle east and certain asian countries through a distribution network but are not approved in the us fab also offers several products used in connection with the treatment of ent disorders 
the lead product is merogel  a thick  viscous hydrogel composed of cross linked hyaluronic acid  a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound healing environment 
fab is partnered with medtronic for worldwide distribution or merogel 
veterinary us sales of hyvisc  our product for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  contributed to product revenue for the year ended december  we continue to look at other veterinary applications and opportunities to expand geographic territories 
research and development anika s research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates  the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development  and process development and scale up manufacturing activities relative to our existing and new products 
our development focus includes chemically modified formulations of ha designed for longer residence time in the body 
our investment in r d has been important over the years  and varies considerably depending on the number and size of clinical trials and studies underway 
for the years and  these expenses were million and million  respectively 
we anticipate tha t we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development  including clinical trials  in the future 
with the acquisition of fab  we have enhanced both our research and development capabilities and our pipeline of candidate products 
fab has research and development programs for new products including hyalobone  a bone tissue filler  hyalospine  an adhesion prevention gel for use after spinal surgery  and hyalofast  to repair cartilage defects 
other key projects include obtaining fda approval to market fab s suite of orthopedic products in the us these products consist of hyalofast  hyaloglide  and hyalonect 
in addition to the fab products in the preceding paragraph  additional products in development include monovisc for us marketing approval  and our first next generation osteoarthritis product 
monovisc is a single injection treatment product that uses a non animal source ha 
monovisc is also our first osteoarthritis product based on our proprietary crosslinked ha technology 
we received ce mark approval for the monovisc product in october  and began sales in europe during the second quarter of  following a small  post marketing clinical study 
in the us  we filed an investigational device exemption  or an ide application  with the fda  and completed the clinical segment of the us monovisc pivotal trial in june  and a follow on retreatment study in september we filed the final module of our monovisc p ma containing the clinical data in december we were informed that there were deficiencies in our submissions through a deficiency non approvable letter  which is the fda mechanism for informing companies of deficiencies 
we submitted additional data and analyses throughout  and have been informed by fda that deficiencies remain 
acting on an option presented by the fda to resolve the remaining open issues  anika requested a review by the orthopedic advisory panel 
the company has not yet received a date for an advisory panel meeting 
we continue to believe that monovisc should receive fda approval 
our second single injection osteoarthritis product under development is cingal  which is based on the same technology platform used in monovisc  with an added active therapeutic molecule to provide broad pai n relief for a long period of time 
during the past year  we have integrated the research and development efforts of anika and fab  and prioritized our new product development activities 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstanc es 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is the euro 
assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated using the exchange rate existing on each respective balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the monthly average exchange rates prevailing throughout the year 
the translation adjustments resulting from this process are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions  and risk of nonperformance 
the accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level instruments include securities traded on active exchange markets  such as the new york stock exchange 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  accounts receivable aging trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
work in process and finished goods inventories include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
the company s policy is to write down inventory when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  and estimated current or future market values 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
revenue recognition general we recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
product revenue revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon shipment to the customer 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales  or if the sales price is fixed or determinable  the company evaluates both the contractual terms and conditions of its distribution and supply agreements as well as its business practices 
product revenue also includes royalties 
royalty revenue is based on our distributors sales and recognized in the same period our distributors record their sale of products manufactured by us 
on a quarterly basis we record royalty revenue based upon sales projections provided to us by our distributor customers 
if necessary we adjust our estimates based upon final sales data received prior to issuing our annual audited financial statements 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue licensing  milestone  and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments  as well as contractual amounts received from partners 
the company s business strategy includes entering into collaborative license  development and or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of the company s products 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones  and royalties on product sales 
the company evaluates each agreement  and elements within each agreement  in accordance with asc subtopic  multiple element arrangements asc 
under asc  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have had stand alone value and there must have been objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
in general  non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments were recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
computer hardware and software are typically amortized over three to five years  and furniture and fixtures over three to eight years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases 
property and equipment under capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred  additions and improvements are capitalized 
when an item is sold or retired  the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved  and the resulting gain or loss  if any  is recognized in income 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of acquired net assets in a business combination exceeded the fair values of net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition 
acquired in process research and development ipr d represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition or are pending regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions 
the value assigned to acquired ipr d is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting revenue from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to present value 
goodwill and ipr d  are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
factors we consider important  on an overall company basis  that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
to conduct impairment tests of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we estimate the fair value for reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to risk free rate of return on an investment  weighted average cost of capital  future revenue  operating margin  working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill as of november  indicated that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporti ng units 
there can be no assurance that  at the time future impairment tests are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
to conduct impairment tests of ipr d  the fair value of the ipr d project is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the ipr d project exceeds its fair value 
we estimate the fair values for ipr d projects using discounted cash flow valuation models which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed projects and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates 
our annual assessment for impairment of ipr d indicated that the fair value of our ipr d as of november  exceeded their respective carrying values 
there can be no assurance that  at the time future impairment tests are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives including purchased software and trade names 
purchased software is amortized over to years and trade names are amortized over years 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
stock based compensation we measure the compensation cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the underlying award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
see note for a description of the types of stock based awards granted  the compensation expense related to such awards  and detail of equity based awards outstanding 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details relative to the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock based compensation 
income taxes our income tax expense includes us and international income taxes 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effects of these differences are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit carryforwards 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increa se this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss  which includes foreign currency translation adjustments 
for the purposes of comprehensive income disclosures  we do not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment  as we intend to reinvest permanently undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss is reported as a component of stockholders equity and  as of december  and  was comprised solely of cumulative translation adjustment gains 
segment information operating segments  as defined under us gaap  are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the company s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer 
based on the criteria established by asc  segment reporting  the company has one reportable operating segment the results of which are disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

year ended december  inc dec inc dec orthobiologics dermal ophthalmic surgery surgical nm veterinary nm not meaningful revenue from orthobiologics increased  or  in the improvement in orthobiologics product revenue was due to increases in domestic orthovisc revenue  as well as increased sales of monovisc in europe  turkey and canada in compared with our us joint health product revenue for totaled  compared to  in  an increase of 
this increase reflects depuy mitek s continued market penetration to an estimated market share of in versus share in international joint health product revenue in increased to  from  in the increase in international revenue was driven by higher product shipments to new and existing customers in eastern europe and the middle east  partially offset by continued weakness in sales in southe rn europe 
fab s orthopedic product revenue was  for the year ended december   or approximately of our product revenue 
although fab s orthopedic revenue was not included in the same period in  it did achieve significant increases in sales of hyalograft c autograft and hyalofast as compared to we expect orthobiologics revenue to increase in compared to  both domestically and internationally 
dermal revenue increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to the addition of fab s advanced wound care products revenue for which totaled  in aesthetic dermatology revenue was  for the year ended december   versus  for the prior year 
in july  our former us distributor  coapt  filed for protection from creditors and we terminated our agreement with them 
coapt contributed approximately  and  of aesthetic dermatology revenue in and  respectively 
the company has directly distributed hydrelletm in the interim to existing customers while it reviews its franchise strategy and opportunities for new distributio n partners 
we continue to seek additional marketing and distribution partners to commercialize our aesthetic products outside the us the aesthetics market is crowded with many large companies  and our sales expectations in this area are modest 
revenue from ophthalmic products in increased  or  to  compared to revenue for these products in the increase was primarily attributable to order timing and inventory management by our partners 
as previously disclosed  anika has been a contract manufacturer for bausch lomb for over years  and the current supply agreement with b l expired on december  effective january   we entered into a non exclusive  two year contract with b l intended to transition the manufacture of amvisc and amvisc plus to an alternative  recently acquired low cost supplier to b l 
b l accounted for of product revenue for the year ended  but is expected to be significantly lower in under the new transition contract 
operating margins under the b l agreeme nt were low  and the company expects to see margin improvement through commercialization of its new anikavisc product 
we are unable to quantify the amount of revenue we will derive from b l and anikavisc in  but expect our overall ophthalmic revenue to decline significantly in compared to sales of our surgical products were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this product group consists primarily of fab s anti adhesion and ent products acquired in december and  as a result  revenue from this product group were significantly higher in as compared to our anti adhesion products include incert  hyalobarrier and hyalobarrier endo 
our leading ear  nose and throat care product is merogel 
fab is partnered with medtronic for worldwide distribution except for italy of its ent products 
we expect surgical product revenue to be relatively flat in compared to veterinary revenue increased  or  to  in as compared with  in we believe the increase for the period was primarily due to inventory management by our partner  boehringer ingelheim vetmedica 
sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which was extended in december to december  we expect hyvisc revenue to be relatively flat in compared to licensing  milestone and contract revenue 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the increase was due to licensing and grant revenue earned by our fab subsidiary  partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and contract revenue from anika 
licensing and milestone revenue includes the ratable recognition of the  in up front and milestone payments related to the jnj agreement 
these amounts are being recognized in income ratably over the ten year expected life of the agreement  or  per year 
product gross profit and margin 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in product gross profit was primarily due to increased sales including the additional revenue from fab 
the decrease in the product gross margin was primarily due to the addition of lower margin fab products into anika s overall mix  and was also negatively affected by inventory reserves and duplicate manufacturing expenditures during the continued transition from woburn to the company s bedford  massachusetts facility 
fab currently operates at a lower volume and outsources most manufacturing to its former parent company  fidia  contributing to its current lower gross margins 
the company plans to transfer a significant portion of the fab product manufacturing to its location in bedford  ma over the next two years 
the company wrote down inventory by approximately  during related to aesthetic and joint health products due to the coapt bankruptcy and the delay in fda approval of monovisc 
looking forward  we expect a continued impact of duplicate facilities on our results during as we complete the transition of operations from our woburn  ma facility to our bedford  ma facility 
as of december   non us monovisc and aesthetic product manufacturing has been moved to the bedford facility 
transition of the remaining products will take place by product line and result in manufacturing activities occurring in both our woburn and bedford in commencing in  the bedford  ma facility is expected to add in excess of million to annual depreciation expense once completely on line 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the higher costs incurred in in connection with the company s us based clinical trials for monovisc  and the post marketing aesthetic dermatology people of color study during the year ended december  the monovisc clinical trial was completed in late this decrease was partially offset by the addition of r d costs at fab 
research and development during was primarily for manufacturing validation activities at our bedford facility  as well as ot her continuing new product development projects in italy and the us we expect research and development expenses will increase significantly in the future with the additional pipeline of new products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by  or  to  from  in the prior year  which also includes million of acquisition related non recurring expenses in connection with our acquisition of fab the increase was primarily due to the addition of fab to the company  including integration and infrastructure development costs  as well as costs related to the creation of monovisc marketing materials and reimbursement strategy consulting 
we expect general and administrative expenses for will increase significantly as we prepare to commercialize monovisc in the us interest income  net 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to a net interest expense of  in interest expense incurred was capitalized during the construction and validation of our bedford  ma facility prior to july   and is the primary reason for the increased expense in versus income taxes 
provisions for income taxes were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate in of  and difference from the us federal statutory rate  is primarily due to three factors the foreign rate differential associated with the net operating loss incurred by fab  lower r d spending in resulting in a decrease in the associated r d credit earned  and continued lower capital spending on the bedford facility resulting in lower state investment tax credits in a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending december is as follows years ended december  statutory federal income tax rate state tax expense  net of federal benefit state deferred tax assets  net of federal benefit  due to rate change permanent items  including nondeductible expenses state investment tax credit federal and state research and development credits foreign rate differential other tax expense during  the company concluded its audit by the massachusetts department of revenue dor for its and tax returns and the statue of limitations expired on certain other previously reserved positions 
the combination of these items resulted in a reduction to our reserve for uncertain tax positions  and a related income tax benefit  of approximately  in  the company recorded an additional reserve of approximately  as the irs is currently auditing the company s taxes for the years ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
net income 
for the year ended december  net income was  or per diluted share compared to  or per diluted share for the same period last year 
the primary driver for this increase in net income was an increase in product sales with a more favorable product mix  and lower clinical spending

no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not utilize any derivative financial instruments  market risk sensitive instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under asc  financial instruments 
our investments consist of money market funds primarily invested in us treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by us treasury obligations  and municipal bonds that are carried on our books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and currency rate risk 
we have two supplier contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates would have a negative impact on our financial statements 
the impact of changes in currency exchange rates for the two contracts on our financial statements was immaterial in our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and long term debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company is subject to interest rate risk on million of variable rate debt 
the interest payable on our debt is determined based at the company s election on either an interest rate based on libor plus or the lender s prime rate and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on the outstanding debt amount as of december   we would have a decrease increase in future annual cash flows of approximately  for every increase decrease in the interest rate 
a significant portion of fab s revenue  and all operating expenses  are denominated in euros which leaves the company vulnerable to foreign exchange risk
