germany venture we owned nine communities in germany 
at the beginning of  we informed the lenders to our german communities and the hoesel land  an undeveloped land parcel  that our german subsidiary was suspending payment of principal and interest on all loans for our german communities and that we would seek a comprehensive restructuring of the loans and our operating deficit guarantees 
as a result of the failure to make payments of principal and interest on the loans for our german communities  we were in default on the loan agreements 
we had entered into standstill agreements with the lenders pursuant to which the lenders had agreed not to foreclose on the communities that were collateral for their loans 
the standstill agreements also stipulated that neither party would commence or prosecute any action or proceeding to enforce their demand for payment by us pursuant to our operating deficit and principal repayment agreements until the earliest of the occurrence of certain other events relating to the loans 
in  we entered into a restructuring agreement  in the form of a binding term sheet  with three of our lenders electing lenders to seven of the nine communities  to settle and compromise their claims against us  including under operating deficit and principal repayment guarantees provided by us in support of our german subsidiaries 
these three lenders contended that these claims had an aggregate value of approximately million 
the binding term sheet contemplated that  on or before the first anniversary of the execution of definitive documentation for the restructuring  certain other of our identified lenders could elect to participate in the restructuring with respect to their asserted claims 
the claims being settled by the three lenders represented approximately percent of the aggregate amount of claims asserted by the lenders that could elect to participate in the restructuring transaction 
the restructuring agreement provided that the electing lenders would release and discharge us from certain claims they may have had against us 
we issued to the electing lenders million shares of our common stock  their pro rata share of up to million shares of our common stock which would have been issued if all eligible lenders had become electing lenders 
the fair value of the million shares at the time of issuance was million 
in addition  we granted mortgages for the benefit of all electing lenders on certain of our unencumbered north american properties the liquidating trust 
in april  we executed the definitive documentation with the electing lenders and we recognized a gain of million  which is included in discontinued operations  in connection with the closing of this transaction 
the details of this transaction are outlined below 
as part of the restructuring agreements  we also guaranteed that  within months of the execution of the definitive documentation for the restructuring  the electing lenders would receive a minimum of million from the net proceeds of the sale of the liquidating trust  which equals percent of the appraised value of these properties at the time of the restructuring agreement 
if the electing lenders did not receive at least million by such date  we would make payment to cover any shortfall or  at such lenders option  convey to them the remaining unsold properties in satisfaction of our remaining obligation to fund the minimum payments 
we have sold four assets for gross proceeds of approximately million with an aggregate appraised value of million through december  as of december   the electing lenders have received net proceeds of million as a result of sales from the liquidating trust 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with another lender of one of our german communities a non electing lender for purposes of the restructuring agreement 
the settlement released us from certain of our operating deficit funding and payment guarantee obligations in connection with the loans 
upon execution of the agreement  the lender s recourse  with respect to the community mortgage  was limited to the assets owned by the german subsidiaries with respect to that community 
in exchange for the release of these obligations  we agreed to pay the lender approximately million over four years  with million of the amount paid at signing 
the payment is secured by a non interest bearing note 
we have recorded the note at a discount by imputing interest on the note using an estimated market interest rate 
the balance on the note which is recorded at million on the consolidated balance sheets will be accreted to the note s stated amount over the remaining term of the note 
we recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with this transaction which is included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
in may  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with ghs pflegeresidenzen grundst cks gmbh ghs and tmw pramerica property investment gmbh prei and together the purchasers  pursuant to which we agreed to sell the real property and certain related assets of eight of our nine german communities 
the sale was made for the account of our 
table of contents german lenders as contemplated by our restructuring agreements discussed above 
the aggregate purchase price was million approximately million as of the signing date which would be paid directly to the german lenders 
in august  we closed into escrow the sale of the real property and certain related assets of seven of our nine german communities and all titles were transferred to the buyer as of november  the consideration for the additional community was paid to the lender that held a lien on the property and we removed the property and the related debt from our balance sheet as of september  in addition to the restructuring agreements  we entered into a settlement agreement with the last remaining non electing lender of one of our german communities 
in april  we paid million to that lender  which was applied against the outstanding amounts of the loans 
the settlement further provided that days after the payment date  we would be released from certain of our operating deficit funding and all of our payment guarantee obligations in connection with the loans  and that we would be entirely released from any remaining operating deficit funding obligations upon the earlier of the sale and transfer of the building or december  after days following the payment date  the lender s recourse would be limited to the assets owned by the german subsidiaries 
in  we were released from these obligations and we recorded a gain of approximately million which is included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closed on the sale of this community and we have removed million in assets and million of mortgage liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we elected the fair value option to measure the financial liabilities associated with and which originated from the restructuring of our german loans 
the fair value option was elected for these liabilities to provide an accurate economic reflection of the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying collateral 
as a result of our election of the fair value option  all changes in fair value of the elected liabilities are recorded with changes in fair value recognized through earnings 
as of december   the notes for the liquidating trust assets are accounted for under the fair value option 
the carrying value of the financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was estimated applying certain data points including the value of the underlying collateral 
the restructured mortgages for the german assets were satisfied in and  as a result  are no longer reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we were liable for a principal repayment guarantee for the hoesel land parcel which was not part of the restructuring agreement 
the hoesel land parcel was sold and the liability was released in we recognized a gain of million on the sale which is reflected in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
bank credit facility in  we entered into the fourteenth amendment to our bank credit facility 
the amendment  among other matters  extended the maturity date of the bank credit facility to december  from december  we repaid million in and have no remaining balance as of december  we are unable to draw against the bank credit facility 
at december   there were million in letters of credit related to our bank credit facility 
these letters of credit are fully cash collateralized

in february  we extended million of debt that was either past due or in default at december  the debt is associated with an operating community and two land parcels 
in connection with the extension we i made a million principal payment at closing  ii extended the terms of the debt on the two land parcels to december  and the operating community remained at a maturity date of april   iii made an additional million principal payment on july   and  among other items  iv defaults under the loan agreements were waived by the lenders 
in august  we further amended this loan with respect to the two land parcels 
this portion of the amendment provided for a million principal repayment  extended the maturity date to december  and waived defaults under the loan agreement 
we fully repaid the debt relating to the two land parcels as of december  we also further amended the loan with respect to the operating community

in all such instances  the construction loans or permanent financing provided by financial institutions is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed community 
we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lenders or ventures with respect to billion of the total venture debt of billion 
under the operating deficit agreements  we are obligated to pay operating shortfalls  if any  with respect to these ventures 
any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the venture s obligations for payment of monthly principal and interest on the venture debt 
we do not believe that these operating deficit agreements would obligate us to repay the principal balance on such venture debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness or maturity 
we have non controlling interests in these ventures 
one venture has financial covenants that are based on the consolidated results of sunrise 
events of default under this venture debt could allow the financial institution who has extended credit to seek acceleration of the loan and or terminate our management agreement 
guarantees we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the venture lenders  whereby after depletion of established reserves  we guarantee the payment of the lender s monthly principal and interest during the term of the guarantee and have provided guarantees to ventures to fund operating shortfalls 
the terms of the guarantees generally match the terms of the underlying venture debt and generally range from three to five years  to the extent we are able to refinance the venture debt 
fundings under the operating deficit guarantees and debt repayment guarantees are generally recoverable either out of future cash flows of the venture or from proceeds of the sale of communities

we recorded losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we are also obligated to fund operating shortfalls 
the depressed condominium real estate market in the washington  dc area has resulted in lower sales than forecasted and we have funded million under the guarantees through december  in addition  we are required to fund marketing costs associated with the sale of the condominiums which we estimate will total approximately million by the time the remaining inventory of condominiums are sold 
in july  the lender alleged that an event of default had occurred regarding loans for both entities 
the event of default was related to providing certain financial information for the ventures that the lender had previously requested 
in october  we received a notices of default related to the nonpayment of interest 
in october  we obtained a default waiver from the lender for one of the loans 
as of december   the lender contends that one of these loans remains in default 
we have accrued million in default interest relating to this loan 
we are in discussions with the lender regarding the alleged default

assignee reimbursement obligations relate to possible liability with respect to leases assigned to us in and entrance fee obligations assumed by us in that remain outstanding approximately million at december  
marriott has informed us that they reserve all of their rights to issue a notice of collateral event under the assignment and reimbursement agreement 
other generally  the financing obtained by our ventures is non recourse to the venture members  with the exception of the debt repayment guarantees discussed above 
however  we have entered into guarantees with the lenders with respect to acts which we believe are in our control  such as fraud or voluntary bankruptcy of the venture  that create exceptions to the non recourse nature of the debt 
if such acts were to occur  the full amount of the venture debt could become recourse to us 
the combined amount of venture debt underlying these guarantees is approximately billion at december  we have not funded under these guarantees  and do not expect to fund under such guarantees in the future 
to the extent that a third party fails to satisfy an obligation with respect to two continuing care retirement communities we manage  we would be required to repay this obligation  the majority of which is expected to be refinanced with proceeds from the issuance of entrance fees as new residents enter the communities 
at december   the remaining liability under this obligation is million 
we have not funded under these guarantees  and do not expect to fund under such guarantees in the future 
contractual obligations our current contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases for our corporate and regional offices  operating leases for our communities  and building and land lease commitments

these contracts are all cancellable with minimal or no cancellation penalties 
contract terms are generally one year or less 
as of december   we did not have any scheduled contributions to unconsolidated entities  but had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recorded as liabilities and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
cash flows our primary sources of cash from operating activities are from management agreement buyout fees  management fees  from monthly fees and other billings from services provided to residents of our consolidated communities and distributions of operating earnings from unconsolidated ventures 
the primary uses of cash for our ongoing operations include the payment of community operating and ancillary expenses for our consolidated and managed communities  general and administrative 
table of contents expenses and restructuring expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate based on the timing of payment to vendors 
reimbursement of these costs from our managed communities will vary as some costs are pre funded  such as payroll  while others are reimbursed after they are incurred 
therefore  there will not always be a correlation between increases and decreases of accounts payable and receivables for our managed communities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively  an increase of million 
this change in cash provided by operations was primarily due to million of buyout fee revenue  million increase from distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities and an increase in cash provided by discontinued operations of million partially offset by a reduction in cash provided by working capital of million

in  net working capital provided cash of million as opposed to using cash of million in discontinued operations used cash of million in as compared to using cash of million in net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for and  respectively  an increase of million 
the change in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures and funding of condominium projects of million  an increase in proceeds from the disposition of property and venture interests of million  a decrease in restricted cash of million and a million increase in cash provided by discontinued operations 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of million in capital expenditures and condominium fundings  an increase in cash provided by discontinued operations of million as a result of asset sale proceeds and a decrease in investments in unconsolidated communities of million 
these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease of million of proceeds from the disposition of property and venture interests and increase in restricted cash of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for and  respectively  an increase of million 
this change was primarily due to an increase in net debt repayments of million and an increase of million in cash used in discontinued operations 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of long term debt of million  a decrease in net borrowings of debt related to discontinued operations of million and repayments of million under our bank credit facility as compared to repayments of million in market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through variable rate debt 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
the following table details by category the principal amount  the average interest rate and the estimated fair market value of our debt in thousands maturity date through december  fixed rate debt variable rate debt past due thereafter total carrying value average interest rate estimated fair market value at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
debt incurred in the future also may bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could 
table of contents increase our interest payment obligations  which would negatively impact earnings 
a one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  a five percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  we are subject to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements 
to date  we have not hedged against foreign currency fluctuation  however  we may pursue hedging alternatives in the future 
in  we recorded million  net  in exchange gains million in gains related to the canadian dollar  in gains related to the euro which are included in discontinued operations and million in losses related to the british pound 
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates than we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets  long lived assets and investments in ventures intangibles and long lived asset groups are tested for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in the projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
a test for recoverability also is performed when management has committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year 
recoverability of an asset group is evaluated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized 
the impairment loss is measured at the lowest level of cash flows which is typically at the community or land parcel level  by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the fair value of an intangible asset  or asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the intangible asset or asset group could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  etc finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings are projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our 
table of contents assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other primary methods used for estimating fair value of a reporting unit  asset  or asset group 
this assumption relies on the market value market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business 
in  certain land parcels  a closed community and units in a condominium project were classified as assets held for sale 
they were recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we used appraisals  bona fide offers  market knowledge and brokers opinions of value to determine fair value 
as the carrying value of an asset was in excess of its fair value less estimated costs to sell  we recorded an impairment charge of million in  which is included in operating expenses under impairment of owned communities and land parcels 
in  land parcels and a closed community classified as assets held for sale had been held for sale for over a year 
therefore  the requirements to be classified as held for sale were no longer being met and the assets were reclassified to held and used or to the liquidating trust 
however  we continue to market the land parcels and closed community 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million for a land parcel and an operating community as the carrying value of these assets was in excess of their fair value 
we used appraisals  bona fide offers  market knowledge and brokers opinions of value to determine fair value 
the impairment charges are included in operating expenses under impairment of owned communities and land parcels 
in connection with the restructuring of our german indebtedness see note  we granted mortgages for the benefit of the electing lenders on certain of our unencumbered north american properties 
as of december   the liquidating trust assets consist of three operating communities  land parcels and one closed community 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million on ten assets held in the liquidating trust as the carrying value of these assets were in excess of the fair value 
we used appraisals  bona fide offers  market knowledge and brokers opinions of value to determine fair value 
the impairment charges are included in operating expenses under impairment of owned communities and land parcels 
nature of estimates required investments in ventures 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
the equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
our investments in ventures accounted for using the equity and cost methods of accounting are impaired when it is determined that there is other than a temporary decline in the fair value as compared to the carrying value of the venture or for equity method investments when individual long lived assets inside the venture meet the criteria specified above 
a commitment to a plan to sell some or all of the assets in a venture would cause a recoverability evaluation for the individual long lived assets in the venture and possibly the venture itself 
our evaluation of the investment in the venture would be triggered when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable due to loan defaults  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating performance and significant industry or economic trends 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions and approach for the evaluation of the individual long lived assets inside the venture are described above 
our approach for evaluation of an investment in a venture would be based on market prices  when available  or an estimate of the fair value using the market approach 
the assumptions and related risks are identical to those used for goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets described above 
in  based on an event of default under the loan agreements of two ventures in which we own a interest  we considered our equity to be other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining equity balance of million for one venture and wrote down the equity balance of the other venture by million 
also in  we chose not to participate in a capital call for two ventures in which we had a interest and as a result our initial equity interest in those ventures was diluted to zero 
accordingly  we wrote off our remaining investment balance of million which is reflected in sunrise s share of earnings loss and return on investment in unconsolidated communities in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  based on poor operating performance of two communities in one venture in which we have a 
table of contents interest  we considered our equity to be other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining equity balance of million 
we have one cost method investment in a company in which we have an approximate interest 
in  based on the inability of this company to secure continued financing and having significant debt maturing in  we considered our equity to be other than temporarily impaired and wrote off our equity balance of million which is recorded as part of sunrise s share of loss earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated communities 
in  we wrote down our equity investments in two of our development ventures by million based on poor performance and defaults under the ventures construction loan agreements 
in  based on the receipt of a notice of default from the lender to a venture in which we own a interest and the poor rental experience in the venture  we considered our equity to be other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining equity balance of million 
also in  we chose not to participate in a capital call for a venture in which we had a interest and we wrote off our remaining investment balance of million and as a result our initial equity interest in the venture was diluted to zero 
we determined the fair value of our investment in a venture in which we had a interest had decreased to zero and was other than temporarily impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
in  we wrote down our equity investments in our fountains and aston gardens ventures by million and million  respectively 
in  a lease between a landlord and a venture  in which we hold a interest  was terminated 
the venture received a termination fee of million  of which our proportionate share was million 
as a result of the lease termination  the venture was liquidated and we recorded an impairment charge of million 
loss reserves for self insured programs nature of estimates required 
we utilize large deductible blanket insurance programs in order to contain costs for certain lines of insurance risks including workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks self insured risks 
the design and purpose of a large deductible insurance program is to reduce the overall premium and claims costs by internally financing lower cost claims that are more predictable from year to year  while buying insurance only for higher cost  less predictable claims 
we have self insured a portion of the self insured risks through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  sunrise senior living insurance  inc sunrise captive 
sunrise captive issues policies of insurance to and receives premiums from sunrise that are reimbursed through expense allocation to each operated community and us 
sunrise captive pays the costs for each claim above a deductible up to a per claim limit 
third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above this limit 
these third party insurers carry an am best rating of a vii or better 
we also offer our employees an option to participate in self insured health and dental plans 
the cost of our employee health and dental benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and the communities based on the respective number of participants working directly either at our community support office or at the communities 
funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs which include estimated annual claims  third party administrative fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administrative costs incurred by us 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
assumptions and approach used for self insured risks 
we record outstanding losses and expenses for the self insured risks and for our health and dental plans based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and management s judgment 
we believe that the allowance for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but the allowance may ultimately be settled for a greater or lesser amount 
any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
while a single value is recorded on sunrise s balance sheet  loss reserves are based on estimates of future contingent events and as such contain inherent uncertainty 
a quantification of this uncertainty would reflect a range of reasonable favorable and unfavorable scenarios 
sunrise s annual estimated cost for self insured risks is determined using management judgment including actuarial analyses at various confidence levels 
the confidence level is the likelihood that the recorded expense will exceed the ultimate incurred cost 
sensitivity analysis for self insured risks 
the recorded liability for self insured risks was approximately million at december  the expected liability is based on a confidence level 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 
if we had used a confidence level  the recorded liability would be approximately million higher 

table of contents we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on sunrise s income from operations would be much less sensitive than the difference above 
assumptions and approach used for health and dental plans 
for our self insured health and dental plans  we record a liability for outstanding claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
this liability is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims and is based on the recommendations of an independent actuary 
the variability in the liability for unpaid claims including incurred but not yet reported claims is much less significant than the self insured risks discussed above because the claims are more predictable as they generally are known within days and the high and the low end of the range of estimated cost of individual claims is much closer than the workers compensation and employers liability risks  automobile liability risk  employment practices liability risk and general and professional liability risks discussed above 
sensitivity analysis for self insured health and dental plan costs 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims for the self insured health and dental plan is included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the liability for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but actual claims may differ 
we record any subsequent changes in estimates in the period in which they are determined and will share with the communities participating in the insurance programs based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
variable interest entities nature of estimates required 
we hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships 
our equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from to 
we review all of our ventures to determine if they are variable interest entities vies 
if a venture meets the requirements and is a vie  we must then determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
assumptions 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could both potentially be significant to the vie 
we perform ongoing qualitative analysis to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie 
at december   we are the primary beneficiary of one vie and therefore consolidate that entity 
valuation of deferred tax assets nature of estimates required 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
asc income tax topic requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not defined by as a likelihood of more than percent such assets will not be realized 
the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
assumptions and approach used 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would be required to establish a valuation allowance 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
as such  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
asc income tax topic states that a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets 

table of contents this assessment  which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis  takes into account a number of types of evidence  including the following nature  frequency  and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses a pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is a source of negative evidence 
in certain circumstances  historical information may not be as relevant due to changed circumstances  sources of future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences are verifiable positive evidence 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence but such projections are more subjective and when such projections are combined with a history of recent losses it is difficult to reach verifiable conclusions and  accordingly  we give little or no weight to such projections when with combined recent financial reporting losses  and tax planning strategies if necessary and available  tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards 
these strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and  depending on their nature  could be heavily weighted 
even though we have income in the current year  we have experienced significant losses for  and in addition the income earned in the current year was primarily a result of specific non recurring transactions 
as indicated above  in making our assessment of the realizability of tax assets we assess reversing temporary differences  available tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income 
we more heavily weight recent financial reporting losses and  accordingly  as of december  have given little or no weight to subjectively determined projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
tax planning strategies have been considered historically but due to the significant net operating loss carryforwards as of december  we have not considered such strategies to be reasonably viable 
as a result of changes in judgment on the realizability of future tax benefits  a valuation allowance was established on all deferred tax assets net of reversing deferred tax liabilities 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  were million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  and therefore the net deferred tax liabilities recorded were zero as of december  and  respectively 
a return to profitability by us in future periods may result in a reversal of the valuation allowance relating to certain recorded deferred tax assets 
liability for possible tax contingencies liabilities for tax contingencies are recognized based on the requirements of asc income tax topic 
this topic requires us to analyze the technical merits of our tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities 
if we determine that it is unlikely that our tax positions will be sustained  a corresponding liability is created and the tax benefit of such position is reduced for financial reporting purposes 
evaluation and nature of estimates required 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step in the evaluation process is recognition 
the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step in the evaluation process is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which a the threshold is met for example  by virtue of another taxpayer s favorable court decision  b the position is effectively settled where the likelihood of the taxing authority reopening the examination of that position is remote  or 
table of contents c the relevant statute of limitations expires 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
interest and penalties 
we are also required to accrue interest and penalties that  under relevant tax law  we would incur if the uncertain tax positions ultimately were not sustained 
accordingly  interest would start to accrue for financial statement purposes in the period in which it would begin accruing under relevant tax law  and the amount of interest expense to be recognized would be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
penalties would be accrued in the first period in which the position was taken on a tax return that would give rise to the penalty 
assumptions 
in determining whether a tax benefit can be recorded  we must make assessments of a position s sustainability and the likelihood of ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
changes in our assessments would cause a change in our recorded position and changes could be significant 
as of december  and  we had recorded liabilities for possible losses on uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
accounting for financial guarantees when we historically entered into guarantees in connection with the sale of real estate  we were prevented from initially either accounting for the transaction as a sale of an asset or recognizing in earnings the profit from the sale transaction 
for guarantees that are not entered into in conjunction with the sale of real estate  we recognize at the inception of a guarantee or the date of modification  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee which require us to make various assumptions to determine the fair value 
on a quarterly basis  we review and evaluate the estimated liability based upon operating results and the terms of the guarantee 
if it is probable that we will be required to fund additional amounts than previously estimated  a loss is recorded 
fundings that are recoverable as a loan from a venture are considered in the determination of the loss recorded 
loan amounts are evaluated for impairment at inception and then quarterly 
assumptions and approach used 
we calculate the estimated loss based on projected cash flows during the remaining term of the guarantee 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital  and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset 
the following key assumptions to our income approach include business projections we make assumptions regarding the levels of revenue from communities and services 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  labor costs  etc finally  we make assumptions about the amount of cash flows that we will receive upon a future sale of the communities using estimated cap rates 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans and budgets  growth rate a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to budgeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which earnings is projected to grow beyond the planning period  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding pricing estimates for our communities and services 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry projections  inflation  interest rates  price of labor  and foreign currency exchange rates  and discount rates when measuring a possible loss  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 

table of contents litigation litigation is subject to uncertainties and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not fully predictable 
various legal actions  claims and proceedings are pending against us  some for specific matters described in note to the financial statements and others arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in other instances  we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of uncertainties related to the outcome and or the amount or range of losses 
new accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu

impact of inflation management fees from communities operated by us for third parties and resident and ancillary fees from owned senior living communities are significant sources of our revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and community occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of senior living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the communities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of community operations 
employee compensation  including salary and benefit increases and the hiring of additional staff to support our growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable us to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of our communities 
we believe  however  that the short term nature of our resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to us of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident and ancillary fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes
