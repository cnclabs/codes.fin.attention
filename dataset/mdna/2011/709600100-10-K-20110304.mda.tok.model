item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for more information 
as an integral part of our securities clearing relationships  we maintain a significant margin lending business with our correspondents and their customers 
under these margin lending arrangements  we extend credit to our correspondents and their customers so that they may purchase securities on margin 
as is typical in margin lending arrangements  we extend credit for a portion of the purchase price of the securities  which is collateralized by existing securities and cash in the accounts of our correspondents and their customers 
we also earn interest income from both our securities and futures operations by investing customers cash and we engage in securities lending activities as a means of financing our business and generating additional interest income 
over the past year  our net interest revenues increased from million in to million in  representing approximately and of our aggregate net revenues  respectively 
clients currently  our principal clients are online  direct access  institutional and traditional retail brokers 
we are increasingly adding large banks  institutional brokers  financial technology companies and securities exchanges as clients 
online broker dealers principally enable investors to perform trades through the broker via the internet through browser based technology 
direct access broker dealers principally provide investors with dedicated software which executes orders through direct exchange interfaces and provides real time high speed level ii market information 
traditional retail brokers usually engage in agency trades for their customers  which may or may not be online 
institutional brokers and hedge funds typically engage in algorithmic trading or other proprietary trading strategies for their own account or  at times  agency trades for others 
our bank clients typically are non us entities making purchases for their brokerage operations 
the type of financial technology client that would most likely use our products and services is a financial data content or trading software firm that purchases our data or combines its offerings with our trading software 
through our acquisitions of goldenberg hehmeyer and co 
ghco and first capitol group llc fcg in  which both operate within penson futures  we added a number of futures related clients  including introducing brokers  non clearing fcms  commercial customers  customers who engage in hedging and risk management activities and other customers who trade futures and other instruments 
we have made significant investments in our us and international data and execution infrastructure  as well as various types of multi currency and multi lingual trading software 
we provide what we believe to be a flexible offering of infrastructure products and services to our clients  available both on an unbundled basis and as a fully integrated solution 
our technology offerings are typically private labeled to emphasize the client s branding 
we seek to put our clients interests first and we believe our position as the leading independent provider of us securities clearing services is a significant differentiating factor 
we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of our significant investments in technology infrastructure to expand sales of our products and services to these and many other clients worldwide 

table of contents industry trends we believe that the market for securities and futures processing products and services is influenced by several significant industry trends creating continuing opportunities for us to expand our business  including shift to outsourced solutions 
broker dealers and many fcms are continuing to outsource their clearing functions 
in addition  firms in the global securities and investment industry are expanding their use of third party technology to manage their securities trading infrastructure 
increase in trading in multiple markets 
investors increasingly seek to trade in multiple markets  asset classes and currencies at once 
the technological challenges associated with clearing  settlement  and custody in multiple geographies  currencies  and asset classes are prompting correspondents to seek the most comprehensive and sophisticated service providers 
we have sought to capitalize on this trend by expanding our product offering into high growth areas such as the futures market  where we have significantly expanded since early net revenues from our futures product offering comprised approximately and of total net revenues in and industry consolidation 
although the significant effort and potential business disruption associated with conversion to a new clearing firm may discourage some correspondents from switching service providers  consolidation among clearing service providers has led to forced conversions 
these conversions result in opportunities for correspondents to seek competing offers and  thus  for service providers to solicit new correspondents business without having to overcome the threshold issue of converting from an incumbent 
we believe we have benefited from industry consolidation by attracting correspondents as a result of the acquisitions of major competitors by larger financial institutions and acquiring other firms 
demand for increased reporting capabilities and integrated technology solutions 
clients are increasingly demanding products that seamlessly integrate front  middle and back office systems and allow for near real time updating of account status and margin balances 
our ability to meet these demands makes us a preferred processing firm for correspondents in the growing algorithmic trading and hedge fund sectors 
opportunities in the canadian  european  asian and australian markets 
the securities and investments industries outside of the us  including those in canada  europe  asia and australia have followed many of the same trends as the us market 
many industry participants are now requiring the same complex and sophisticated clearing and execution services that are common in the us in addition  clearing firms in these markets are less likely to own trading applications  creating opportunities for the sale of nexa s products 
we opened our first asian office in hong kong in the first quarter of and an office in tokyo during in order to expand our asian operations 
our asian operations are currently focused on marketing our technology products 
we launched our australian office in the second quarter of  and began clearing operations there in december  we recently acquired execution contracts for australian correspondents and we currently have australian correspondents 
we expect significant growth opportunities in australian markets in our product offering clearing and related services as a securities and futures processing infrastructure provider  penson s services include securities and futures clearing and settlement  execution  custody  account maintenance  data processing services  and technology services 
clearing is the verification of information and matching between two parties in a securities or futures transaction which is followed by the subsequent settlement of that transaction in exchange for payment or margin deposit 
custody services are the safe keeping and managing of another party s assets  such as securities  as well as customer account maintenance and customized data processing services 
clients for whom we provide securities clearing and custody services are generally referred to as our correspondents or introducing brokers 
we also provide commodity risk management and other services to certain of our futures customers 
we have made substantial investments in the development of customized data processing systems that we use to provide these back office services to our correspondents on an integrated  efficient and cost effective basis  
table of contents allowing us to process a high volume of transactions without sacrificing stability and reliability 
in  we processed an average of million equity transactions  million equity options contracts and  futures contracts per day 
our products and services reduce the need for our correspondents to make significant capital investments in a clearing infrastructure and allow them to focus on their core business competencies 
these systems also enable our correspondents to provide customized  timely transaction and account information to their customers  and to monitor the risk level of their customers on a real time basis 
we have found that our comprehensive suite of advanced technology solutions is often an important factor in winning new correspondents 
as an integral part of our securities clearing relationships  we maintain a significant margin lending business with most of our correspondents and their customers 
under these margin lending arrangements  we extend credit to our correspondents and their customers so that they may purchase securities on margin 
as is typical in margin lending arrangements  we extend credit for a portion of the purchase price of the securities  which is collateralized by existing securities and cash in the accounts of our correspondents and their customers 
we also earn interest income from both our securities and futures operations by investing customers cash and we engage in securities lending activities as a means of financing our business and generating additional interest income 
technology and data products an important component of our business strategy is to identify and deploy technologies relevant to our target markets 
our technology and data product offerings  which are principally developed and marketed through our nexa subsidiary  include customizable front end trading platforms  a comprehensive database of real time and historical us and international equities  options and futures trade data  and order management services 
this technology embedded in our securities and futures processing infrastructure has enhanced our capacity to handle an increasing volume of transactions without a corresponding increase in personnel 
we use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties to provide customized  detailed account information to our clients 
our technology is critical to our vision of providing a flexible and comprehensive offering of products and services to our clients 
our technology revenues generally include revenues from software development and customization of products and features  but our technology products are designed to generate substantial subscription based revenues 
the majority of our technology revenues is recurring in nature and is generated by correspondents under contracts that generally have initial terms of two years 
our competitive strengths established market position as the largest independent provider of correspondent clearing services in our primary markets 
we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become the leading global independent provider of securities clearing services in our primary markets with active correspondents in the us  canadian  asian  australian and uk markets  which includes futures correspondents as of december  as of december  based on the number of correspondents  we were the largest independent clearing broker dealer in the us  canada and australia  as well as the second largest clearing broker in the uk furthermore  as of december  based on the number of correspondents  we are also the second largest clearing broker in the us overall 
unlike most other major clearing service providers  we are not affiliated with a large financial institution and we generally do not compete with our clients in other lines of business 
we believe our position as the leading independent provider of securities clearing services in our primary markets is a significant differentiating factor 
fully integrated securities processing and technology solutions 
we are a leading provider of infrastructure to financial intermediaries  offering integrated solutions with the ability to address all major securities processing needs 
through the integration of our own technology across all of our products and services  we have been able to expand our client base and increase our revenue from existing clients 
our products and services facilitate trading in multiple markets  asset classes and currencies  with integrated execution  clearing and settlement solutions 
it is our belief that  while some clients are willing to obtain these 
table of contents products from multiple vendors  many will determine that it is easier to obtain solutions with lower integration costs and risks from one provider that can also address the regulatory requirements of their business 
flexible services and infrastructure 
we provide a broad offering of infrastructure  technology and data products and services to our clients  available both on an unbundled basis and as a fully integrated solution 
we work closely with each of our clients to tailor the set of products and services appropriate for their individual needs 
highly attractive and diversified client base 
our client base comprises the following categories online  direct market access  institutional  retail and algorithmic  options  futures  foreign exchange and other 
for the year ended december   no single category of correspondent represented more than of total net revenues 
in addition  no single correspondent represented more than of net revenue  with our top ten correspondents constituting of our net revenues 
as previously announced  we will be losing a significant amount of the revenues generated from our largest correspondent during  however  we believe we will be able to replace a substantial portion of that revenue from new correspondents we have signed 
additionally  we have diversified our client base internationally through our operations in canada  the uk  australia and asia  and by asset class through expanding our operations into the futures business and foreign exchange businesses  among others 
scalable  recurring revenue model 
our business benefits from a highly scalable platform that is capable of processing significant additional volume with limited incremental increases in our expenses 
we receive a recurring stream of revenues based on the trading volumes of each of our correspondents with a low marginal cost to process transactions 
we typically maintain two to three year exclusive contracts with our correspondents 
furthermore  there are typically high switching costs as the transition from one provider of clearing services to another is disruptive to a correspondent s business 
in addition  a significant portion of our technology revenues are based on asp arrangements with clients  linked to transactions and users 
thus  we become even more indispensable to our clients by not only licensing them our software but by also providing them with hardware to run our products along with related support services 
proven and highly motivated management team 
with an average of years of industry experience and holding a substantial equity interest in penson  our executive committee has the proven ability to manage our business through all stages of the business cycle 
roger j 
engemoen  jr  and philip a 
pendergraft  our chairman and chief executive officer  respectively  founded our business in and have built it to its current position 
daniel p 
son  co founder of our company  resigned his position as president of the company effective september   but continues to serve the company as a non executive vice chairman of the board  and is expected to provide consulting services in pursuant to a contract entered into between pwi and holland consulting  llc  a company controlled by mr 
son 
business strategies leverage existing platform to expand our product offerings and client base 
we believe our infrastructure provides a leading fully integrated securities clearing and technology product package to our core market  and additional products can be offered and new clients can be added with minimal marginal cost 
using this infrastructure  we intend to expand our client base by focusing on high volume direct access and online broker dealers and the futures trading industry 
we will continue to market our clearing services to the growing futures trading  direct access and online broker dealer markets and on margin lending as a core complementary service 
further expanding our client base in the institutional and retail brokerage markets 
we are expanding our focus on the traditional institutional and retail brokerage industry 
many institutional and retail brokers in the 
table of contents us have outsourced their clearing functions  and we believe this trend is continuing internationally  which creates opportunities for us globally 
we are also targeting these firms for our technology products and services  which we believe will increase as we finalize the transition to broadridge s systems 
see business strategic acquisitions for a description of the ridge acquisition 
expanding our client base in the quantitative trading sector 
our technology products enable us to increasingly market our services to the rapidly growing quantitative trading sector 
this sector is among the most significant drivers of growth in the overall securities markets and we intend to increase our focus on this market sector 
expanding our futures business 
our purchase of ghco in february  was a significant step in expanding our futures clearing operations and our purchase of fcg in november  gives us the ability to expand our futures offering to clients that need risk management and other services 
expand offering of portfolio margining 
portfolio margining allows us to extend margin lending to cover a higher percentage of the purchase price of securities than the percentage required under regulation t based on a risk calculation model approved by the sec 
we approve our correspondents internally for portfolio margining based on several factors including account size  net capital  regulatory background and margin experience 
at december   we had portfolio margining accounts with a weighted average balance of approximately million in the fourth quarter of expand offering of foreign exchange products 
in  we launched our foreign exchange product  which provides our customers a focused traditional and technology based center of competency in both deliverable and non deliverable foreign exchange 
our foreign exchange product is traditionally used by correspondents to facilitate international transactions in equities and bonds 
these services can be accessed through direct contact with our foreign exchange department or through our electronic trading platform 
expanding our operations internationally 
we believe our ability to service clients internationally will become more important as investors increasingly trade on a global basis 
in addition  we intend to expand our margin lending business internationally 
our presence in the non us markets gives us several opportunities to pursue additional revenues across our product and service offerings 
it allows us to better serve our correspondents who are us based by helping facilitate their growth and providing them with greater access to international markets 
it also gives us greater access to the potential customer base in those local markets 
we opened our first asian office in hong kong in the first quarter of and an office in tokyo in we expanded our offering of technology products in asian markets in and and intend to continue expansion into the asian markets in we launched pfsa in the second quarter of  and began clearing operations there in december we expect significant growth opportunities in the australian markets in enhance revenue potential of each client relationship 
our growth model includes selling additional products to our existing clients 
many of our correspondents currently only utilize our securities clearing services  but we maintain a broad product suite across geographies that provides us with a significant opportunity to cross sell our execution  futures  foreign exchange and technology services to our current base of correspondents 
capitalize on industry trends 
we are positioned to benefit from several broad industry trends  including internationalization of trading activity  consolidation among service providers  and increased demand for trading infrastructure that supports multiple products on the same computer terminal  including equities  options  futures and foreign exchange as well as increased outsourcing of securities processing 

table of contents pursue accretive acquisitions 
through our past acquisitions  we have grown internationally  expanded our product base and added correspondents 
as of december   we had successfully integrated our acquisition of the clearing contracts of ridge clearing outsourcing solutions  inc ridge  our most significant acquisition to date 
while we will continue to invest in developing and enhancing our existing business solutions  we also may pursue accretive acquisitions that will expand our technology product offerings  our clearing service capability and our client base

through the use of our internally developed technology  combined with technology licensed from third parties  we are able to update the account portfolios of our correspondents customers as securities transactions are executed and cleared 
a customer is able to access detailed and personalized information about his account  including current buying power  trading history and account balances 
further  our solution allows a customer to download brokerage account information into quicken  a personal financial management software program  and other financial and spreadsheet applications so that all financial data can be integrated 
holding and safeguarding securities and cash deposits we hold and safeguard securities and cash deposits of our correspondents customers  which require us to take legal responsibility for those assets 
many of our correspondents do not have the ability to hold securities and cash deposits due to regulatory requirements that require that the holder must comply with the net capital rules of the sec and other regulators with respect to these activities 
securities borrowing and lending we lend securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other broker dealers as a means of financing our business and facilitating transactions 
we also engage in conduit activities where we borrow securities from one broker dealer and lend the same securities to another broker dealer 
this lending is permitted under and governed by sec rules 
see government regulation and regulation of securities lending and borrowing 
all of our securities borrowing and lending activities are performed under a standard form of securities lending agreement  which governs each party s rights to mark securities to market 

table of contents proprietary trading certain of our subsidiaries engage in limited forms of proprietary trading 
this trading includes computerized trading and non automated trading strategies involving short term proprietary positions in exchange traded equities and options  derivatives  foreign currencies  fixed income and other securities  in general  these strategies involve relatively short term market exposure and are typically undertaken in conjunction with hedging strategies and the use of derivative contracts designed to mitigate the risk associated with these proprietary positions 
these activities in the aggregate are insignificant to revenues and pretax income loss 
futures products in addition to the futures clearing services provided by penson futures  the fcg division of penson futures provides retail  risk management and consultation services for certain of our futures clients 
technology and data products an important component of our business strategy is to identify and to deploy technologies relevant to our target markets 
the technology embedded in our securities and futures processing infrastructure has enhanced our capacity to handle an increasing volume of transactions without a corresponding increase in personnel 
we use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties to provide customized  detailed account information to our clients 
to increase our processing capacity  we moved our us securities clearing operations to a dedicated processing platform provided by sungard in the first quarter of we intend to move our canadian and us operations to broadridge s systems during and our uk operations during our technology is critical to our vision of providing a flexible and comprehensive offering of products and services to our clients 
our technology and data product offerings include customizable front end trading platforms  a comprehensive database of historic us and international equities  options and futures trade data  and order management services 
our approach to the development and acquisition of technology has allowed us to create an evolving suite of products that provides specific solutions to meet our clients individual requirements 
we also provide risk management and consultation services to our futures customers through the fcg division of our penson futures subsidiary 
nexa provides our clients with innovative trading management technology with a global perspective 
nexa specializes in direct access trading technology and provides complete online brokerage solutions  including direct access trading applications  browser based trading interfaces  back office order management systems  market data feeds  historical data  and execution technology services  generally on a license fee basis 
nexa s fastpath product provides a full suite of financial information exchange fix gateway solutions for clients who require global connectivity  high throughput and reliability 
fix execution solutions allow clients to automatically transmit  receive or cancel advanced order types  execution reports  order status  positions  liquidity flags and account balances 
clients can connect using their own front end or back office applications or utilize applications available from nexa 
we generally provide our solutions to our clients on a private labeled basis to emphasize the client s branding 
nexa s products  such as omni pro  axis pro  and meridian  are designed to accommodate various market segments by providing different trading platforms and functionality to users 
most of our front end products benefit from several important features such as the ability to trade equities  options and futures and to have unified risk management for trading across multiple asset classes 
although there is a significant market for front end trading platforms that is independent of the market for clearing services  we have found that our ability to integrate our technology related products with our clearing services provides clients with another compelling reason to use penson for their clearing needs 
we believe this broader  integrated offering is a significant factor in our conversion of client prospects into actual clients 
our technology revenues generally include revenues from software development  customization of products and features and licensing fees  but our technology products are designed to generate subscription based revenue 
table of contents over time 
our technology revenues decreased over the last year from million in to million in institutional and active retail front end trading software nexa has developed and is continuing to expand various front end trading software products 
we offer several products that are oriented towards different market segments 
omni pro is a level ii trading platform oriented to professional traders and provides broker dealer administrative modules 
level ii software enables the trader  among other things  to view prices for the same security across various markets and to select the desired market for order execution 
axis pro is a multi currency level ii trading platform focused on active retail traders 
meridian is a level i trading platform for less intensive applications for the active retail trader 
both axis pro and meridian are offered with broker dealer administrative modules that allow broker dealers to monitor customer buying power and other regulatory compliance tasks  and to provide a repository for customer information 
all of our front end products benefit from a number of compelling features such as the ability to trade equities  options and futures and have unified risk management for trading across these products 
many of our clearing competitors do not have similar systems that effect trades in all such instruments with similar risk mitigation capabilities 
there is a dynamic market for front end trading platforms that is independent of the market for our clearing services 
however  we have found that our ability to offer these products provides our clients with another compelling reason to use our clearing and other products and services and is at times important in our conversion of client prospects into actual clients 
global execution infrastructure nexa has built significant proprietary software and licensed certain software and telecommunications services to enable our clients to use our technology infrastructure to send orders for securities to all major north american exchanges  ecns and market destinations 
our clients can choose to use our execution infrastructure  independent of our other services  or to opt for a bundled solution combining technology products together with clearing and settlement 
this allows us to access a differentiated market segment for clients that clear with another firm or are self clearing  but which do not have a similar infrastructure capability 
in particular  because our network has been designed to maximize speed of execution  our offerings are very attractive to algorithmic traders for whom speed is essential to successful implementation of their trading strategies 
our infrastructure required significant time and investment to build and very few of our clearing competitors offer anything that is directly comparable 
global data products we believe it is critical to provide our clients with global trade data solutions 
nexa provides research quality  historical intraday time series data plus real time data feeds for the commodity and equity markets 
our suite of data products was significantly enhanced by our acquisition of the tick data assets in january its database of historical intraday equities  options and futures data from exchanges in north america  europe and asia is presented tick by tick and is delivered in a compressed  proprietary format 
the database of historical cash index data contains the most widely followed equity indices 
nexa also offers tickstream  a fully customized  low latency  real time market data feed 
data is delivered through a simple to use application program interface api and powered by advanced ticker plants that have multiple direct connections to global exchanges 
while these products do not currently generate material revenues  we provide data to over  clients  which we believe provides significant opportunities for cross selling our other products and services 
nexa has also built its own data ticker plant to access data from most us and many foreign exchanges and market centers 
we have also licensed certain foreign data from other sources 
the result is a very comprehensive offering of real time  delayed and historical data that we can market to our clients 
as with the international execution hub  our clients can use our data solutions together with  or independent of  our other products and services 
this enables us to compete with major securities data providers to offer comprehensive data solutions 
furthermore  historical data offerings are not offered by most data services providers or clearing firm competitors and enable us to serve new client segments such as algorithmic traders and hedge funds to which we have had relatively less historical exposure through our clearing operations 

table of contents key licensed technology and proprietary customization we license a software program called phase from sungard 
phase is an online  real time data processing system for securities transactions 
phase performs the core settlement functions with industry clearing and depository organizations 
to increase our processing capacity  we moved our us securities clearing operations to a dedicated processing platform provided by sungard in the first quarter of we have built a significant amount of proprietary software around phase which allows us to customize phase to meet each of our client s unique needs 
this customization increases the reliability and efficiency of our data processing model and permits us to process trades more quickly than if we relied on phase alone 
this customization also offers our clients more flexible access to information regarding their accounts  including the ability to see critical information in real time on a continuously updated basis  manage their buying power across different accounts containing diverse instruments such as equities  options and futures  and  receive highly customized reports relating to their activity 
the above noted products are principally used by our us securities clearing subsidiary but  in many cases  enable our non us customers  both through our non us affiliates and directly  to access leading edge products and services when trading in the us markets 
we offer third party software that we have licensed that we believe offers an increased variety of settlement and clearing applications  to certain of our canadian correspondents who trade futures products 
we currently process the trading activity of the correspondents we acquired from ridge principally using broadridge s systems  and we intend to transition the remainder of our us operations to broadridge s systems during we completed the conversion of our canadian operations to broadridge s systems in february  we anticipate this transition will expand our product offering to include  among other things  the outsourcing of certain of our correspondents operations 
we intend to transition our uk operations to broadridge s systems in see business strategic acquisitions for a description of the proposed broadridge transaction 
sales and marketing we focus our sales and marketing efforts in the us primarily on the direct access and online sectors  but also focus on the algorithmic trading and hedge fund sectors of the global securities and investment industry 
we are aggressively marketing execution only services to the global financial services market domestically and through our foreign subsidiaries 
we have capitalized on this opportunity by implementing cross border and multi currency trade processing capabilities 
we participate in industry conferences and trade shows and seek to differentiate our company from our competitors based on our reputation as an independent provider of a technology focused integrated execution  clearing and settlement solution and based on our ability to support trading in multiple markets  multiple investment products and multiple currencies 
we generally enter into standard clearing agreements with our securities correspondents for an initial term of two years  though many of our contracts are for much longer terms 
during the contract period  we provide clearing services based on a schedule of fees determined by the nature of the financial instrument traded and the volume of the securities cleared 
in some cases our standard contract will also include minimum monthly clearing charge requirements 
subsequent to the initial term  these contracts typically allow the correspondent to cancel our services upon providing us with days written notice 
futures clearing contracts between us and our correspondents are generally terminable on days notice 
futures clearing contracts directly between us and our customers are generally terminable at will 
as of december   we had active correspondents worldwide  consisting of active securities clearing correspondents and active futures clearing correspondents 
of the active securities clearing correspondents  are located in the us  while our us  canadian and australian clearing operations provide services to  and correspondents  respectively 
before conducting business with a correspondent  we review a variety of factors relating to the prospective correspondent  including the correspondent s experience in the 
table of contents securities industry  its financial condition and the personal backgrounds of the key principals of the firm 
we seek to establish relationships with correspondents whose management teams and operations we believe will be successful in the long term  so that we may benefit from increased clearing volume and margin lending activity as the businesses of our correspondents grow 
strategic acquisitions we have engaged in a number of acquisitions that have facilitated our ability to expand our client base and provide leading edge technology infrastructure as well as to open international markets  positioning us to pursue a strategy of combining our increasingly global securities offerings with enhanced technology offerings on a multi instrument  multi currency  international platform 
to date  none of our acquisitions have exceeded the defined significant subsidiary thresholds pursuant to section w of sec regulation s x

table of contents competition the market for securities clearing and margin lending services is highly competitive 
we expect competition to continue and intensify in the future 
we encounter direct competition from firms that offer services to direct access and online brokers 
some of these competitors include goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  pershing llc  a member of bny securities group  national financial services llc  a fidelity investments company  merrill lynch co  inc  a subsidiary of bank of america  mf global ltd 
formerly man financial and rj o brien associates llc 
we also encounter competition from other clearing firms that provide clearing and execution services to the securities industry 
most of our competitors are affiliated with large financial institutions 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our clearing and margin lending services are breadth of services  technology  financial strength  client service and price 
based on management s experience  we believe that we presently compete effectively with respect to most of these factors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors offer a wider range of services and products than we offer and have greater name recognition and more extensive client bases 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities  technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more attractive terms to clients 
recent advancements in computing and communications technology are substantially changing the means by which securities transactions are effected and processed  including more access online to a wide variety of services and information  and have created a demand for more sophisticated levels of client service 
the provision of these services may entail considerable cost without an offsetting increase in revenues 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or may consolidate to enhance their services and products 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and they may acquire significant market share 
additionally  large firms that currently perform their own clearing functions may decide to start marketing their clearing services to other firms 
in addition to companies that provide clearing services to our target markets  we are subject to the risk that one or more of our correspondents may elect to perform their clearing functions themselves 
the option to convert to self clearing operations may be attractive due to the fact that as the transaction volume of the correspondent increases  the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for self clearing may eventually be offset by the elimination of per transaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm 
additionally  performing their own clearing services allows self clearing firms to retain customer free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities 
in order to make a clearing arrangement with us more attractive to these high volume broker dealers  we may offer such firms transaction volume discounts or other incentives 
we are also subject to the risk that one or more of our correspondents may be acquired by a firm which is already self clearing  or clears through another broker dealer 
our largest correspondent  thinkorswim  was acquired by td ameritrade in we anticipate that approximately two thirds of the business we currently clear for thinkorswim will be converted to td ameritrade in intellectual property and other proprietary rights despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe upon our proprietary rights 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
we have incurred litigation expenses related to the protection of our intellectual property in the past  and are continuing to do so with respect to the realtime data proceedings see legal proceedings for a description of these proceedings 
intellectual property claims  with or without merit  are time consuming to defend  often result in costly litigation  can divert management s attention and resources and may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 

table of contents government regulation the securities and financial services industries generally are subject to extensive regulation in the us and elsewhere 
as a matter of public policy  regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with  among other things  safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets  not with protecting the interests of creditors or the shareholders of regulated entities such as penson 
in the us  the securities and futures industry is subject to regulation under both federal and state laws 
at the federal level  the sec regulates the securities industry  while the cftc regulates the futures industry 
these federal agencies along with nyse  finra  nfa  the various stock and futures exchanges and other self regulatory organizations sros require strict compliance with their rules and regulations 
companies that operate in these industries are subject to regulation concerning many aspects of their business  including trade practices  capital structure  record retention  money laundering prevention  and the supervision of the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
failure to comply with any of these laws  rules or regulations could result in censure  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  the suspension or termination of the operations of the company or the suspension or disqualification of our directors  officers or employees 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we and some of our officers and other employees have been subject to claims arising from the violation of such laws  rules and regulations 
as a registered broker dealer  pfsi is required by law to belong to the securities investor protection corporation sipc 
in the event of a member s insolvency  the sipc fund provides protection for customer accounts up to  per customer  with a limitation of  on claims for cash balances 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in the uk  australia and canada that are involved in the securities and financial services industries and may expand our business into other countries in the future 
to expand our services internationally  we will have to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we conduct business 
the securities and financial services industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated 
the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to expand internationally 
due to its focus on technology products  which are generally not subject to the regulatory regimes applicable to securities trading  penson asia is not subject to many of the same restrictions that apply to our uk  australia and canada subsidiaries 
the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
additional regulation  changes in existing laws and rules  or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of securities firms 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act recent market and economic conditions have led to the enactment of new legislation and other proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  into law 
while certain provisions of the dodd frank act will be effective immediately  many other provisions will be effective only following extended transition periods of varying lengths 
therefore  it is impractical at present to forecast the comprehensive effects of the legislation 
the dodd frank act also mandates the preparation of studies on a wide range of issues  which could lead to additional legislation or regulatory changes 
this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule making 
the legislation and regulation of financial institutions  both domestically and internationally  include calls to increase capital and liquidity requirements  limit the size and types of the activities permitted  and increase taxes on some institutions 
regulation of clearing activities we provide clearing services in the us  canada  australia and europe through our subsidiaries 
broker dealers and fcms that clear their own trades are subject to substantially more regulatory requirements than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical  technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of customers 
table of contents and broker dealers  could lead to censures  fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our clients  the customers of our clients and others 
due to our provision of futures clearing services in addition to securities clearing services  we are also subject to additional regulatory requirements  including those of the cftc  nfa and futures exchange regulations in various jurisdictions 
as a result  we must comply with an increased amount of regulatory requirements and face additional liabilities if we are not able to comply with the regulatory environment 
we also provide sponsored access to certain entities  which allows those entities to submit trades to certain exchanges through our market participant identification mpid 
through the provision of sponsored access  we have been able to substantially increase our volumes on certain exchanges 
the increased volume often allows us to achieve certain pricing discounts  which we generally share with our sponsored participants 
we are responsible for any trades submitted by those entities that use our mpid 
recently  the sec and certain domestic and foreign sros have increased scrutiny of sponsored access programs 
to the extent any additional regulations are enacted with respect to sponsored access in any jurisdiction where we provide sponsored access  we will be required to follow such regulations which may result in our limiting or eliminating the use of this service 
even if we are able to continue to offer this service  we may have to incur substantial costs related to implementation of risk controls with low latency to comply with new regulations 
regulation of securities lending and borrowing we engage in securities lending and borrowing services with other broker dealers by lending the securities that we hold for our correspondents and their customers to other broker dealers  by borrowing securities from other broker dealers to facilitate our customer transaction activity  or by borrowing securities from one broker dealer and lending the same securities to another broker dealer 
within the us  these types of securities lending and borrowing arrangements are governed by the sec and the rules of the federal reserve 
the following is what we believe to be a descriptive summary of some important sec and federal reserve rules that govern these types of activities  but it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the regulations that govern these types of activities 
our securities lending and borrowing activities are primarily  although not exclusively  transacted through our us broker dealer subsidiary  which is subject to the sec s net capital rule and customer protection rule 
the net capital rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to ensure that broker dealers will have adequate resources  including a percentage of liquid assets  to fund expenses of a self or court supervised liquidation 
see business government regulation and regulatory capital requirements 
while the net capital rule is designed to ensure that the broker dealer has adequate resources to pay liquidation expenses  the objective of the sec s customer protection rule is to ensure that investment property of the firm s customers will be available to be distributed to customers in liquidation 
the customer protection rule operates to protect both customer funds and customer securities 
to protect customer securities  the customer protection rule requires that broker dealers promptly obtain possession or control of customers fully paid securities free of any lien 
however  broker dealers may lend or borrow customers securities purchased on margin or customers fully paid securities  if the broker dealer provides collateral exceeding the market value of the securities it borrowed and makes certain other disclosures to the customer 
with respect to customer funds  the customer protection rule requires broker dealers to make deposits into an account held only for the benefit of customers reserve account based on its computation of the reserve formula 
the reserve formula requires that broker dealers compare the amount of funds it has received from customers or through the use of their securities credits to the amount of funds the firm has used to finance customer activities debits 
in this manner  the customer protection rule ensures that the broker dealer s securities lending and borrowing activities do not impact the amount of funds available to customers in the event of liquidation 
sec rules c and c under the exchange act the hypothecation rules set forth requirements relating to the borrowing or lending of customers securities 
the hypothecation rules prohibit us from borrowing or lending customers securities in situations where the securities of one customer will be held together with securities of another customer  without first obtaining the written consent of each customer  the securities of a customer will be held together with securities owned by a person or entity that is not a customer  or the securities of a customer will be subject to a lien for an amount in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all customers securities 

table of contents regulation t was issued by the federal reserve pursuant to the exchange act in part to regulate the borrowing and lending of securities by broker dealers  as well as to regulate the extension of credit by broker dealers 
with respect to securities borrowing and lending  regulation t requires that a borrowing or lending of securities by a broker dealer be for a proper purpose  ie for the purpose of making delivery of the securities in the case of short sales  failure to receive securities required to be delivered  or other similar situations 
if a broker dealer reasonably anticipates a short sale or fail transaction  a borrowing may be made by the broker dealer up to one settlement cycle in advance of trade date 
regulation t also regulates payment requirements for transactions in customer cash accounts and the level of credit extended in customer margin accounts 
a broker dealer may extend credit to a customer in a margin account only against collateral consisting of cash or margin eligible securities  as defined in the exchange act or margin securities  as defined in regulation t 
under regulation t  the current required initial margin for a long position in a margin equity security is percent of the current market value of the security 
the required margin for a short position is percent of the current market value of the security 
maintenance margin requirements are set in accordance with the rules of the sros 
however  we may require the deposit of a higher percentage of the value of equity securities purchased on margin 
securities borrowed transactions are extensions of credit in that the securities lender generally receives cash collateral that exceeds the market value of the securities that were lent 
in the national securities markets improvements act of  the us congress amended section c of the exchange act to exempt certain broker dealers from the federal reserve s credit regulations 
recently  the sec and other sros have approved new rules permitting portfolio margining that have the effect of permitting increased margin on securities and other assets held in portfolio margin accounts relative to non portfolio accounts 
we began offering portfolio margining to our clients in the second quarter of and had portfolio margin accounts as of december  with respect to such securities borrowing and lending  regulation sho issued under the exchange act generally prohibits  among other things  a broker dealer from accepting a short sale order unless either the broker dealer has already borrowed the security  has entered into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the security or has reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due and has documented compliance with this requirement 
rule under the exchange act requires broker dealers and clients to make delivery on short sales effected in the us no later than t under rule  a clearing broker dealer that does not purchase or borrow securities to cover any fail position as of the opening of trading on t is subject to a borrowing penalty for each security that the clearing broker fails to deliver subject to the allocation provision noted below 
the borrowing penalty will apply until the clearing broker dealer purchases a sufficient amount of the security to make full delivery on the fail position and that purchase clears and settles 
if a clearing broker dealer becomes subject to the borrowing penalty  the penalty will prohibit the clearing broker dealer from effecting short sales for its own account or for that of any correspondent broker dealer or customer unless the clearing broker dealer has borrowed the securities in question or has entered into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the securities 
clearing broker dealers are permitted to reasonably allocate the close out requirement to a correspondent broker dealer that is responsible for the fail position 
accordingly  if we have a fail position that we are unable to timely cover  or where the fail position was the responsibility of one of our correspondent broker dealers and we cannot allocate the close out responsibility to it  we would be subject to the borrowing penalty 
we could remain subject to the borrowing penalty until such time as we have purchased a sufficient amount of the security to make full delivery on the fail position and that purchase has cleared and settled  which generally is three business days after the purchase 
due to the requirements of rule  our costs associated with securities borrowings to facilitate customer short selling may continue to increase and the scope of our securities lending business may significantly decrease  which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
failure to maintain the required net capital  accurately compute the reserve formula or comply with regulation t  portfolio margining rules or regulation sho may subject us to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by nyse  finra and other regulatory bodies and  if not cured  could ultimately require our us broker dealer subsidiary s liquidation 
a change in the net capital rule  the customer protection rule  regulation t or the portfolio margining rules or the imposition of new rules could adversely impact our ability to engage in securities lending and borrowing 

table of contents regulation of internet activities our business  both directly and indirectly  relies extensively on the internet and other electronic communications gateways 
to date  the use of the internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints 
however  the governmental agencies within the us and elsewhere are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the internet 
accordingly  new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that change our own and our correspondents abilities to transact business through the internet or other electronic communications gateways 
regulatory capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member of nyse and finra  pfsi is subject to the sec s net capital rule 
the net capital rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker dealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
among deductions from net capital are adjustments that are commonly called haircuts  which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of firm inventory prior to disposition 
failure to maintain the required net capital would require us to cease securities activities during any period where we did not meet minimum levels of net capital and may subject us to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by nyse  finra and other regulatory bodies and  if not cured  could ultimately require liquidation of our us clearing operations 
the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends  redemption of stock  the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder  employee or affiliate  if such payment would reduce our net capital below required levels 
finally  nyse and finra rules prevent a broker dealer from expanding its business or permit nyse or finra to require reductions in the broker dealer s business for broker dealers experiencing financial or operational difficulties 
the net capital rule also requires notice to regulators with respect to certain capital withdrawals and provides that the sec may restrict any capital withdrawal  including the withdrawal of equity capital  or unsecured loans or advances to stockholders  employees or affiliates  if such capital withdrawal  together with all other net capital withdrawals during a day period  exceeds of excess net capital and the sec concludes that the capital withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
in addition  the net capital rule provides that the total outstanding principal amount of a broker dealer s indebtedness under specified subordination agreements  the proceeds of which are included in its net capital  may not exceed of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of all subordinated indebtedness included in net capital  par or stated value of capital stock  paid in capital in excess of par  retained earnings and other capital accounts for a period in excess of days 
a change in the net capital rule  the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit some of our operations that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from pfsi  which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay or repurchase debt  including the senior convertible notes due  the senior second lien notes due  the amended and restated credit facility and the ridge seller note  or repurchase shares of outstanding stock 
a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business 
our uk subsidiary is subject to fsa rules that require it to maintain adequate financial resources including both capital resources and liquidity resources in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due 
the current capital resources requirement for the subsidiary is approximately million although the capital resources requirement will vary depending on the current expenditure  liabilities and risks incurred or assumed 
capital resources may be constituted by eligible share capital and eligible subordinated debt 
the subsidiary must constantly monitor compliance with its financial resource requirements  regularly submit financial reports to the fsa monthly and report any breach of the financial resource requirements to the fsa 
a breach of the financial resource requirements may result in disciplinary action against the subsidiary for which it may receive a financial penalty  or where the breach is serious  a suspension or cessation of the subsidiary s business and a withdrawal of the subsidiary s authorization to conduct investment business in whole or in part 
the imposition of fsa disciplinary sanctions  the temporary suspension of business or the partial revocation of the subsidiary s authorization to conduct investment 
table of contents business may severely damage the reputation of the subsidiary and result in diminution of earnings 
the revocation of the subsidiary s authorization to conduct investment business in the uk may result in a discontinuation of our uk operations and the loss of its revenues 
pfsc is a member of iiroc  an approved participant with the montreal exchange  a participating organization of the toronto stock exchange and a member of the tsx venture exchange and various canadian alternative trading systems 
pfsc is subject to rules  including those of iiroc  relating to the maintenance of capital 
iiroc regulates the maintenance of capital by dealer members by requiring that investment dealers periodically calculate their risk adjusted capital rac in accordance with a prescribed formula which is intended to ensure that members will be in a position to meet their liabilities as they become due 
a dealer member s rac is calculated by starting with its net allowable assets  which are assets that are conservatively valued with emphasis on liquidity  and excluding assets that cannot be disposed of in a short time frame or whose current realizable value is not readily known  net of all liabilities  and deducting the applicable minimum capital and margin requirements  adding tax recoveries  if any  and subtracting the member s securities concentration charge 
furthermore  iiroc rules provide for an early warning system which is designed to provide advance warning of a dealer member encountering financial difficulties 
various parameters based on prescribed calculations involving the dealer member s rac are designed to identify dealer members with capital adequacy problems 
if any of the parameters are violated  several sanctions or restrictions are imposed on the dealer member 
these sanctions  which may include the early filing of a monthly financial report  a written explanation to iiroc from the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  a description of the resolution  or an on site visit by an examiner  are designed to reduce further financial deterioration and prevent a subsequent capital deficiency 
failure of a member to maintain the required risk adjusted capital as calculated in accordance with applicable iiroc requirements can result in further sanctions such as monetary penalties  suspension or other sanctions  including expulsion of the dealer member 
pfsa holds an australian financial services license and is a market participant of the asx and is an asx clear participant 
as such  pfsa is subject to  amongst other things  the rules established by the asx and asx clear governing the minimum risk based capital requirements for participants in the asx and asx clear 
the asx clear capital requirements establish minimum core liquid capital requirements and minimum requirements for a participant s liquid capital as compared to a number of different risk based metrics which make up the participant s total risk requirement 
the risk requirements vary depending on the operations undertaken by the participant 
a participant s core liquid capital is based principally on a participant s equity and retained profits  while the liquid capital adjusts core liquid capital to take account of reserves and in certain cases subordinated debt and preferred stock 
currently  participants  including pfsa  are required to maintain a core liquid capital of at least aud million 
the core liquid capital requirement for third party clearing participants such as pfsa will increase to aud million on january  asx clear participants are also required to maintain a ratio of their liquid capital to total risk requirements of greater than and a ratio of total option risk margin to liquid capital of less than in the event that this ratio is or more the participant is required to deposit funds to reduce the ratio and such funds may then not be withdrawn until the ratio is below pfsa is currently in compliance with the minimum capital requirements established by asx clear which are applicable to it and regularly calculates its core liquid capital  liquid capital  total risk requirements and other applicable metrics to monitor ongoing compliance with the minimum capital requirements established by asx clear 
our futures clearing business is subject to the capital and segregation rules of the cftc  nfa  and futures exchanges in the us and the fsa and futures exchanges in the uk if we fail to maintain the required capital or violate the customer segregation rules  we may be subject to monetary fines and the suspension or revocation of our license to clear futures contracts and carry customer accounts 
any interruption in our ability to continue this business would impact our revenues and profitability 
the regulatory capital requirements that affect our regulated subsidiaries are stringent and subject to significant and uncontrollable change 
our inability to comply with any of the current requirements or any future changes to these requirements could cause us to suffer significant financial loss 

table of contents margin risk management our margin lending activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility and changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
we attempt to minimize the risks inherent in our margin lending activities by retaining in our margin lending agreements the ability to adjust margin requirements as needed and by exercising a high degree of selectivity when accepting new correspondents 
when determining whether to accept a new correspondent  we evaluate  among other factors  the correspondent s experience in the industry  its financial condition and the background of the principals of the firm 
in addition  we have multiple layers of protection  including the balances in customers accounts  correspondents commissions on deposit  clearing deposits and equity in correspondent firms  in the event that a correspondent or one of its customers does not deliver payment for our services 
we also maintain a bad debt reserve 
our customer agreements and fully disclosed clearing agreements require industry arbitration in the event of a dispute 
arbitration is generally less expensive and more timely than dispute resolution through the court system 
although we attempt to minimize the risk associated with our margin lending activities  there is no assurance that the assumptions on which we base our decisions will be correct or that we are in a position to predict factors or events which will have an adverse impact on any individual customer or issuer  or the securities markets in general

table of contents item a 
risk factors many factors could have an effect on pwi s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic  environmental  political  industry  business and financial conditions 
the principal factors are described below 
risks related to our business and our industry we face substantial competition from other securities and commodities processing and infrastructure firms  which could harm our financial performance and reduce our market share 
the market for securities and futures processing infrastructure products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services to our market 
our competitors include goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  pershing llc  a member of bny securities group  national financial services llc  a fidelity investments company  merrill lynch co  inc  a subsidiary of bank of america  mf global ltd 
formerly man financial and rj obrien associates llc 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors also offer a wider range of services and financial products than we do and have greater name recognition and more extensive client bases than ours 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than ours 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
if we fail to compete effectively  our market share could decrease and our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
increased competition has contributed to the decline in net clearing revenue per transaction that we have experienced in recent years and may continue to create downward pressure on our net clearing revenue per transaction 
in the past  we have responded to the decline in net clearing revenue by reducing our expenses  but if the decline continues  we may be unable to reduce our expenses at a comparable rate 
our failure to reduce expenses comparably would reduce our profit margins 
we depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our clearing revenues 
our ten largest current clients accounted for approximately of our total net revenues for the year ended december   while no client accounted for more than of net revenues 
the loss of even a small number of these clients at any one time could cause our revenues to decline 
as previously announced  we will be losing a significant amount of the revenues generated from our largest correspondent during  however  we believe we will be able to replace a substantial portion of that revenue from new correspondents we have signed 
our clearing contracts generally have an initial term of two years  and allow the correspondent to cancel our services upon providing us with days of notice  in most cases after the expiration of the fixed term 
many of our futures clearing contracts with correspondents may be terminated with a day notice 
our clearing contracts with these correspondents can also terminate automatically if we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 
in past periods  we have experienced temporary declines in our revenues when large clients have switched to other service providers 
there can be no assurance that our largest clients will continue to use our products and services 
our clearing operations could expose us to legal liability for errors in performing clearing functions and improper activities of our correspondents 
any intentional failure or negligence in properly performing our clearing functions or any mishandling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our correspondents and their customers could lead to censures  fines or other sanctions by applicable authorities as well as actions in tort brought by parties who are financially harmed by those failures or mishandlings 
any litigation that arises as a result of our clearing operations could harm our reputation and cause us to incur substantial expenses associated with litigation and damage awards that could exceed our liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts 
in the normal course of business  we purchase and sell securities as both principal and agent 
if another party to the transaction fails to fulfill its contractual 
table of contents obligations  we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transaction 
in the past  clearing firms in the us have been held liable for failing to take action upon the receipt of customer complaints  failing to know about the suspicious activities of correspondents or their customers under circumstances where they should have known  and even aiding and abetting  or causing  the improper activities of their correspondents 
although our correspondents provide us with indemnity under our contracts  we cannot assure you that our procedures will be sufficient to properly monitor our correspondents or protect us from liability for the acts of our correspondents under current laws and regulations or that securities industry regulators will not enact more restrictive laws or regulations or change their interpretations of current laws and regulations 
if we fail to implement proper procedures or fail to adapt our existing procedures to new or more restrictive regulations  we may be subject to liability that could result in substantial costs to us and distract our management from our business 
our provision of sponsored and direct market access could expose us to legal liabilities for trading activity by third parties we provide sponsored access to certain entities  which allows those entities to submit trades to certain exchanges through our market participant identification mpid 
we are responsible for any trades submitted by those entities that use our mpid 
in addition  we provide certain of our correspondents with direct market access to various exchanges 
recently  the sec and certain domestic and foreign sros have increased scrutiny and enacted stringent regulation of sponsored and direct market access providers 
if we cannot or do not adequately assess and successfully control the risks involved with all of the trading activities of our correspondents  we may be unable to protect ourselves from those risks 
though we have indemnification provisions in our contracts with each of those entities  given the increased regulatory scrutiny in this area  these indemnification provisions may not adequately protect us from liabilities incurred due to our provision of these services 
we will be required to follow such regulations as soon as they become effective  which may limit or eliminate our provision of these services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
even if we are able to continue to offer this service  we may have to incur substantial costs related to implementation of risk controls with low latency to comply with new regulations 
market weaknesses and lower trading volumes may negatively affect our results of operations and profitability 
we are subject to risks as a result of volume fluctuations in the securities and futures markets 
a prolonged period of market weakness and low trading volumes could adversely impact the business of our customers and our business 
there is a direct correlation between the volume of our customers trading activity and our results of operations 
if our customers trading activity decreases  we expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability 
we  along with other participants in the equity and futures markets  have experienced a substantial decrease in trading volumes over the most recent quarters that has materially adversely affected our profitability during such time 
continuing low  short term interest rates have negatively impacted the profitability of our margin lending business 
the profitability of our margin lending activities depends to a great extent on the difference between interest income earned on margin loans and investments of customer cash and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances and borrowings 
while they are not linearly connected  if short term interest rates fall  we generally expect to receive a smaller gross interest spread  causing the profitability of our margin lending and other interest sensitive revenue sources to decline 
recent decreases in short term interest rates have contributed to a decrease in our profitability and will continue to do so while lower rates continue to be in effect 
assuming constant customer balances  we expect that a basis point change in the federal funds rate would affect our pre tax income by approximately million per quarter 
short term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the us  which generally lead to a 
table of contents decrease in the gross spread we earn 
this is most significant when the federal funds rate is on the lower end of its historical range  as it is today 
interest rates in canada  the uk and australia are also subject to fluctuations based on governmental policies and economic factors and these fluctuations could also affect the profitability of our margin lending operations in these markets 
our margin lending business subjects us to credit risks and if we are unable to liquidate an investor s securities when the margin collateral becomes insufficient  the profitability of our business may suffer 
we provide margin loans to investors  therefore  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit 
as of december   our receivables from customers and correspondents were billion  which predominantly reflected margin loans 
the company generally recognizes interest income on an accrual basis as it is earned 
at december  and  the company had approximately million and million in receivables  respectively  primarily from customers and correspondents  that were substantially collateralized and considered collectable  for which interest income was being recorded only when received 
our credit risks include the risk that the value of the collateral we hold could fall below the amount of an investor s indebtedness 
this risk is especially great when the market is rapidly declining 
agreements with margin account investors permit us to liquidate their securities with or without prior notice in the event that the amount of margin collateral becomes insufficient 
despite those agreements and our house policies with respect to margin  which may be more restrictive than is required under applicable laws and regulations  we may be unable to liquidate the customers securities for various reasons  including the pledged securities may not be actively traded  there may be an undue concentration of securities pledged  or an order to stop transfer by the issuer of securities may be issued with regard to pledged securities 
in the us  our margin lending is subject to the margin rules of the federal reserve  nyse and finra  whose rules generally permit margin loans of up to of the value of the securities collateralizing the margin account loan at the time the loan is made  subject to requirements that the customer deposit additional securities or cash in its accounts so that the customer s equity in the account is at least of the value of the securities in the account 
we are also subject to rules and regulations in canada and the uk with regard to our margin lending activities in those markets 
in certain circumstances  we may provide a higher degree of margin leverage to our correspondents with respect to their proprietary trading businesses than otherwise permitted by the margin rules described above based on an exemption for correspondents that purchase a class of preferred stock of pfsi 
in addition  for our portfolio margining accounts  we are able to extend substantially more credit than permitted by the margin rules described above to approved customers pursuant to a risk formula adopted by the sec 
as a result  we may increase the risks otherwise associated with margin lending with respect to these correspondent and customer accounts 
we rely  in part  on third parties to provide and support the software and systems we use to provide our services 
any interruption or cessation of service by these third parties could harm our business 
we have contracted with sungard data systems and  more recently  broadridge to provide a major portion of the software and systems necessary for our execution and clearing services 
on september   we entered into an amendment to our current agreement with sungard that requires sungard to provide a dedicated processing platform for the processing of our us clearing operations 
our current agreement with sungard will expire in february   but can be terminated by sungard upon written notice in the event that we breach the agreement 
in the past  we have experienced limited processing delays  occasional hardware and software outages with third party service providers  including sungard 
any major interruption in our ability to process our transactions through sungard or broadridge would harm our relationships with our clients and impact our growth 
we also license many additional generally available software packages 
failures in any of these applications could also harm our business operations 
we rely on similar systems for other subsidiaries  problems with each of which could cause similar problems and results in us suffering significant financial harm 
we rely on sungard  broadridge and other third parties to enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis  and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
now that we have converted our canadian operations and as we continue to transition our united states operations to broadridge s 
table of contents systems  we expect to be able to rely on broadridge to be able to provide similar future product developments for our us  us and canadian securities operations 
see business strategic acquisitions for a description of the broadridge transaction 
certain of our subsidiaries will continue to use sungard to provide the software and systems necessary to provide services to our clients  including penson futures 
sungard s provision of a dedicated processing platform allowed us to process our increased us trade volume in and we expect to be able to continue to increase or us trade volume after converting to broadridge s systems in and beyond 
if in the future  however  enhancements or upgrades of third party software and systems cannot be integrated with our technologies or if the technologies on which we rely fail to respond to industry standards or technological changes  we may be required to redesign our proprietary systems 
software products may contain defects or errors  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
the inability of third parties to supply us with software or systems on a reliable  timely basis or to allocate sufficient capacity to meet our trading volume requirements could harm relationships with our clients and our ability to achieve our projected level of growth 
our anticipated transition of certain support services to ridge and broadridge may involve unforeseen delays  costs or technological complications 
if we are unable to transition our services efficiently to broadridge  we may experience interruptions or difficulties with respect to the services broadridge is expected to provide 
we have signed a technology services and outsourcing agreement with broadridge whereby broadridge is expected to replace sungard and our pfsl service providers as our provider of certain software and systems necessary for our execution and clearing services 
see business strategic acquisitions for a description of the broadridge transaction 
we completed the conversion of our canadian operations to broadridge in february  we anticipate completing the transition of our us and pfsl operations to those software and systems over the next one to two years 
any delays  technology issues or unexpected costs could substantially impair our ability to continue to provide clearing and execution services to our clients that could cause us to suffer material financial loss 
in addition  there can be no guarantees that we will not experience additional issues with respect to processing delays  hardware and software outages  or other service issues with broadridge than we experience with our current providers 
any additional processing delays or issues we experience could impair our ability to provide services to our clients  which could impact our growth and cause significant financial loss 
our products and services  and the products and services provided to us by third parties  may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties  and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs  distract our management or prevent us from conducting our business 
although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties and typically incorporate indemnification provisions in any agreements where we license third party software  we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights and have incurred litigation expenses in the past  and are continuing to incur expenses due to the ongoing realtime data case  related to our defense of our intellectual property rights 
if we infringe upon the rights of third parties through use of our proprietary software or software licensed to us by third parties  we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those or similar rights on commercially reasonable terms 
in either of these events  we would need to undertake substantial reengineering to continue offering our services and may not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur additional  substantial costs defending the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use and infringement by third parties  and our failure to do so may weaken our competitive position  and any legal claim we seek to pursue may require us to incur substantial cost and distract management and us from conducting our business 
despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe upon our proprietary rights 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
we cannot be certain that our 
table of contents intellectual property rights are sufficiently protected against unauthorized use and infringement by third parties  and our failure to do so may weaken our competitive position 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets  which may require us to incur substantial cost and distract our management and us from conducting our business 
see also business intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
if our clients account information is misappropriated  we may be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation 
increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information has led to increasingly complex legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection  information security and consumer privacy 
the law in these areas is not consistent or settled 
while we employ what we believe to be a high degree of care in protecting our clients confidential information  if third parties penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our clients personal or account information  or we were to otherwise release any such confidential information without our clients permission  unintentionally or otherwise  we could be subject to liability arising from claims related to impersonation or similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  as well as suffer harm to our reputation 
to effect secure transmissions of confidential information over computer systems and the internet  we rely on encryption and authentication technology 
while we periodically test the integrity and security of our systems  we cannot assure you that our efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our clients account information will be successful 
internet security concerns have been a barrier to the acceptance of online trading  and any well publicized compromise of security could hinder the growth of the online brokerage industry 
we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect clients transactions and account data 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of network or internet security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk 
we seek to control our risk exposure through a risk management framework that is designed to monitor  identify and measure the types of risk we face 
while our management believes that our risk management framework effectively evaluates and manages the financial  operational  market  credit and other risks we face  risk management tools  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations  which could cause them to be ineffective 
as a result  we face the risk of losses  including losses resulting from firm errors  customer defaults or fraud 
unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets may cause adverse changes in securities values  decreases in liquidity and trading positions and increased volatility  all of which could increase our risk exposure to our customers and to other third parties 
in addition  while we monitor every customer account that is less than fully collateralized with liquid securities daily  our risk controls may not be able to protect us from substantial losses in those accounts 
if our risk management tools are unable to control our risk exposure  we may suffer material losses or suffer other adverse consequences that could impair our ability to continue our operations 
we may be subject to material litigation proceedings that could cause us significant reputational harm and financial loss 
we are subject from time to time to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  customer  and other issues on a global basis  based on our activity or the activity of our correspondents 
as described in item legal proceedings  we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters 
these matters include our involvement in a bankruptcy proceeding concerning sentinel management group  inc sentinel  which is described in detail in item the bankruptcy trustee in this matter is seeking the return of pre and post bankruptcy petition transfers made to penson futures and penson financial futures  inc pffi  a subsidiary of pwi  to which we have objected 
we intend to vigorously defend this position  but we are not able to predict the outcome of this dispute at this time 
in the event that penson futures and pffi are obligated to return a substantial portion of previously distributed funds to the sentinel estate  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for 
table of contents the period in which the payment is made 
in addition  we are currently involved in a matter regarding nexa s use of certain intellectual property rights 
an unfavorable outcome in that matter may require us to terminate use of certain intellectual property we currently employ  or to license such intellectual property at a high cost 
litigation generally is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings can occur 
an unfavorable ruling in any matter could include monetary damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from providing clearing or technology services 
if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter  our business and results of operations could suffer significant reputational and financial loss 
any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers 
our services depend on our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage significant databases  and to receive and process securities and futures orders through a variety of electronic media 
our principal computer equipment and software systems  including backup systems  are maintained at various locations in texas  chicago  boston  new jersey  minnesota  toronto  montreal  sydney and london 
our systems or any other systems in the trading process could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons  including computer viruses or undetected errors in our internal software programs or computer systems  inability to rapidly monitor all intraday trading activity  inability to effectively resolve any errors in our internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected  heavy stress placed on our systems during peak trading times  or power or telecommunications failure  fire  tornado or any other natural disaster 
while we continue to monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility  we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict future volume increases or volatility or that our systems will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation 
any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems  communications systems or any other systems in the clearing or trading processes could cause the customers of our clients to suffer delays in the execution of their trades 
these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers and could subject us to claims and losses  including litigation claiming fraud or negligence  damage our reputation  increase our service costs  cause us to lose revenues or divert our technical resources 
if our operational systems and infrastructure fail to keep pace with our anticipated growth  we may experience operating inefficiencies  client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities 
we have experienced significant growth in our client base  business activities and the number of our employees 
the growth of our business and expansion of our client base has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems  the training of personnel to operate these systems and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies 
while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict the timing or rate of this growth or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis 
in addition  the scope of procedures for assuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations has changed as the size and complexity of our business has increased 
we have implemented and continue to implement formal compliance procedures to respond to these changes and the impact of our growth 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to improve our systems for operations  financial controls  and communication and information management  to refine our compliance procedures and enhance our compliance oversight  and 
table of contents to recruit  train  manage and retain our employees 
our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems  financial systems and controls and office facilities 
in the absence of continued revenue growth  the costs associated with these investments would cause our operating margins to decline from current levels 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our recent or future growth successfully 
if we fail to manage our growth  we may experience operating inefficiencies  dissatisfaction among our client base and lost revenue opportunities 
a failure in the operational systems of third parties could significantly disrupt our business and cause losses 
we face the risk of operational failure  termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
in recent years  there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses and other financial intermediaries  which has increased our exposure to operational failure  termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost effective alternatives in the event of any such failure  termination or constraint 
any such failure  termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions  service our clients and manage our exposure to risk 
if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients  our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished 
the global securities and futures industry is characterized by increasingly complex infrastructures and products  new and changing business models and rapid technological changes 
our clients needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes 
for example  an increasing number of our clients are from market segments including hedge funds  algorithmic traders and direct access customers who demand increasingly sophisticated products 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to respond to our clients demands for new services  products and technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  to adapt to technological advancements and changing standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients 
our existing correspondents may choose to perform their own clearing services as their operations grow  in which case we would lose the revenues generated by such correspondents 
we market our clearing services to our existing correspondents on the strength of our ability to process transactions and perform related back office functions at a lower cost than the correspondents could perform these functions themselves 
as our correspondents operations grow  they often consider the option of performing clearing functions themselves  in a process referred to in the securities industry as self clearing 
as the transaction volume of a correspondent grows  the cost of implementing the necessary infrastructure for self clearing may eventually be offset by the elimination of per transaction processing fees that would otherwise be paid to a clearing firm 
additionally  performing their own clearing services allows self clearing firms to retain their customers margin balances  free credit balances and securities for use in margin lending activities 
if our clients choose to self clear  we would lose their revenue and our business could be adversely affected 
we are also subject to the risk that one or more of our correspondents may be acquired by a firm which is already self clearing  or clears through another broker dealer 
our largest correspondent  thinkorswim  was acquired by td ameritrade in we anticipate that approximately two thirds of the business we currently clear for thinkorswim will be converted to td ameritrade in our ability to sell our services and grow our business could be significantly impaired if we lose the services of key personnel 
our business is highly dependent on a small number of key executive officers 
we have entered into compensation agreements with various personnel  but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of the key personnel or the inability to identify  hire  train and retain other qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 
competition for key personnel and other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the securities and futures processing infrastructure industry is intense  and there is no assurance that we would be able to recruit management personnel to replace these individuals in a timely manner  or at all  on acceptable terms 

table of contents we may face risks associated with potential future acquisitions that could reduce our profitability or hinder our ability to successfully expand our operations 
over the past few years  our business strategy has included engaging in acquisitions which have facilitated our ability to provide technology infrastructure and establish a presence in international markets 
we have completed five acquisitions since  including the acquisitions of ghco and fcg in that significantly expanded our futures business 
additionally we completed the acquisition of substantially all of ridge s contracts with its securities clearing clients in june  in the future  we may acquire additional businesses or technologies as part of our growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions  which potentially involve the following risks diversion of management s time and attention to the negotiation of the acquisitions  difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses  technologies  operations and personnel including  but not limited to  the increased trade volume of acquired businesses  the need to modify financial and other systems and to add management resources  assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses  unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations and disruption of our ongoing business  dilution to our existing stockholders due to the issuance of equity securities that may make it difficult for us to raise capital from equity financing in the future  possible adverse short term effects on our cash flows or operating results  and possible accounting charges due to impairment of goodwill or other purchased intangible assets 
failure to manage our acquisitions to avoid these risks could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our ability to borrow a limited amount of funds under our amended and restated credit facility may adversely affect our liquidity and our results of operations 
currently  we have the capacity to borrow up to  under the amended and restated credit facility 
while we believe we are in a very solid financial position  and our broker dealer subsidiaries continue to have access to capital to finance day to day operations through separate secured facilities  the relatively limited current availability under this facility could adversely affect us if we have an unanticipated need for additional capital and cannot obtain capital  or can only obtain capital on terms that are not favorable to us  from other sources when such funds are required 
while we believe that we would be able to find alternative sources of capital should we need to raise additional funds  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to do so on terms that are sufficiently favorable or in a timely manner 
covenants in our credit agreement and certain other debt instruments restrict our business in many ways 
our amended and restated credit facility  the notes and other outstanding debt instruments include various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
these covenants limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or prepay certain indebtedness  make investments  make capital expenditures  engage in certain transactions with our affiliates  enter into acquisitions  consolidate  merge or sell assets  incur liens and change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries 
in addition  the amended and restated credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
our amended and restated credit facility and the notes also require that pfsi maintain net regulatory capital of at least of its aggregate debt balances 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the amended and restated credit facility  the notes and other outstanding debt instruments 

table of contents our amended and restated credit facility  the notes and other outstanding debt instruments include various events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the amended and restated credit facility the notes or other outstanding debt instruments  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the obligations under our amended and restated credit facility  the notes or the convertible notes were accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding thereunder which would have a material adverse effect on us 
our revenues may decrease due to declines in trading volume  market prices  liquidity of securities markets or proprietary trading activity 
we generate revenues primarily from transaction processing fees we earn from our clearing operations and interest income from our margin lending activities and interest earned by investing customers cash 
these revenue sources are substantially dependent on customer trading volumes  market prices and liquidity of securities markets 
over the past several years the us and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility 
sudden or gradual but sustained declines in market values of securities can result in reduced trading activity  illiquid markets  declines in the market values of securities carried by our customers and correspondents  the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations  reduced margin loan balances of investors  and increases in claims and litigation 
the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our clearing operations and margin lending activities 
certain of our subsidiaries engage in proprietary trading activities 
please see our discussion in business securities processing and proprietary trading 
historically these activities have accounted for a very small portion of our total revenues and net income loss 
with respect to most of such trading  we endeavor to limit our exposure to markets through  among other means  employing hedging strategies and by limiting the period of time that we have market exposure 
however  we are not completely protected against market risk from such trading at any particular point in time and proprietary trading risks could adversely impact operating results in a specific financial period 
continued market instability could negatively affect our operations and financial condition 
as a financial services provider  our business is sensitive to conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally  as well as to the soundness of particular financial services institutions with which we transact business 
among other things  national and international markets have continued through to suffer significant turmoil initially caused by a sharp downturn in markets for mortgage related securities and non investment grade debt securities and loans 
several large financial institutions including  without limitation  commercial banks  insurance companies  and brokerage firms  have either filed for bankruptcy or been the subject of governmental intervention in the form of loans  equity infusions or direct government ownership in receivership 
others have been sold in whole or in part to third parties 
financial services institutions that deal with each other are often interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
as a result  a default or failure by  or even concerns about the stability or liquidity of  one or more financial services institutions could lead to significant market wide liquidity problems  or losses or defaults by other institutions  including us 
in addition  our operations may suffer to the extent that ongoing market volatility causes individuals and institutional traders and other market participants to curtail or forego trading activities  which could adversely affect our operations and financial conditions 

table of contents our significant non us operation exposes us to global exchange rate fluctuations that could impact our profitability 
we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations 
our market risk consists principally of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates 
as we conduct a significant portion of our operations outside the us  fluctuations in currencies of other countries  especially the british pound and the canadian and australian dollars  may materially affect our operating results 
as we continue to expand our business operations globally  our exposure to fluctuations in currencies of other countries will continue to increase 
we do not typically use financial instruments to hedge our income statement exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
a substantial portion of our revenues and cost of operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in our consolidated financial statements  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period and financial position based on the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  at a constant level of business  our reported international revenues  earnings  assets and liabilities will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and or translation risks effectively  or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to significant additional risk 
requirements to close out fails resulting from short sales could increase our costs and adversely affect our securities lending business 
we are subject to rule under the exchange act  which requires clearing broker dealers to make delivery on short sales effected in the us no later than t under rule  clearing broker dealers that do not purchase or borrow securities to cover certain fail positions as of the opening of trading on t are subject to a borrowing penalty for each security that the clearing broker fails to deliver subject to the allocation provision noted below 
the borrowing penalty  which requires pre borrowing in connection with short sales  will apply until the clearing broker purchases a sufficient amount of the security to make full delivery on the fail position and that purchase clears and settles 
if a clearing broker becomes subject to the borrowing penalty  the penalty will prohibit the clearing broker from effecting short sales in that security for its own account or for that of any introducing broker or customer unless the clearing broker has borrowed the securities in question or has entered into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the securities 
clearing broker dealers are permitted to reasonably allocate the close out requirement to an introducing broker that is responsible for the fail position 
as the clearing broker dealer  if we are unable to timely cover a fail position and cannot allocate the close out responsibility to the broker dealer that is responsible for the fail position  we would be subject to the borrowing penalty until such time as we have purchased a sufficient amount of the security to make full delivery on the fail position and that purchase has cleared and settled  which generally is three business days after the purchase 
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate also have restrictions on short selling 
because of the requirements of rule and foreign restrictions on short selling  our costs associated with handling short sales  including the costs associated with closing out fail positions and borrowing securities to facilitate short selling may increase significantly 
in addition  if we become subject to the borrowing penalty  our customers may be less likely to use our securities lending department for short sale transactions and the scope of our securities lending business may significantly decrease  which will adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
on february   the sec adopted additional restrictions on short selling stock 
these restrictions  known as the alternative uptick rule  restrict short selling in securities that have dropped more than in one day 
these changes and potential future regulatory changes related to short selling of securities may have a negative impact on our ability to earn the spreads we have historically collected 

table of contents general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets  which could result in lower revenues from our business operations 
trading volume  market prices and liquidity are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
these factors include the availability of short term and long term funding and capital  the level and volatility of interest rates  legislative and regulatory changes  currency values and inflation  and national  state and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions 
these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets 
our largest source of revenues has historically been revenues from clearing operations  which are largely driven by the volume of trading activities of the customers of our correspondents and proprietary trading by our correspondents 
our margin lending revenues and technology revenues are also impacted by changes in the trading activities of our correspondents and customers 
accordingly  any significant reduction in activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the proportion of clearing operations revenues and interest income  the lengthy sales and integration cycle with new correspondents  the gain or loss of business from a correspondent  changes in per transaction clearing fees  changes in bad debt expense from margin lending as compared to historical levels  changes in the rates we charge for margin loans  changes in the rates we pay for cash deposits we hold on behalf of our correspondents and their customers and changes in the rates at which we can invest such cash deposits  changes in the market price of securities and our ability to manage related risks  fluctuations in overall market trading volume  the relative success and or failure of third party clearing competitors  many of which have increasingly larger resources than we have as a result of recent consolidation in our industry  the relative success and or failure of third party technology competitors including  without limitation  competitors to our nexa business  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and other expenses  and the amount and timing of capital expenditures 
our expense structure is based on historical expense levels and the expected levels of demand for our clearing  margin lending and other services 
if demand for our services declines  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in order to achieve profitability 
due to the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our historical revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon such comparisons as indicators of future performance 
we 
table of contents also cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain the rates of revenue growth we have experienced in the past  or improve our operating results 
our involvement in futures and options markets subjects us to risks inherent in conducting business in those markets 
we principally clear futures and options contracts on behalf of our correspondents and their respective customers 
trading in futures and options contracts is generally more highly leveraged than trading in other types of securities 
this additional leverage increases the risk associated with trading in futures and options contracts  which in turn raises the risk that a correspondent  introducing broker  or customer may not be able to fully repay its creditors  including us  if it experiences losses in its futures and options contract trading business 
we may not be able to or determine not to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
as a foreign exchange trade dealer  we enter into currency transactions with certain of our institutional clients or other institutions using modeled prices that we determine and may seek to hedge our risk by executing similar transactions on the various exchanges or electronic communication networks of which we are a participant 
while we expect to be able to limit our risk in our transactions with our clients through hedging transactions on exchanges or ecns or through other counterparty relationships  there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into these transactions at prices similar to those which we entered into with our clients 
in addition  while we may intend to enter into the hedging transactions after we enter into a transaction with our client or the relevant institution  it is possible that currency prices could fluctuate before we are able to enter into such hedging transactions or  for other reasons  we may determine not to hedge such risk 
the securities and futures businesses are highly dependent on certain market centers that may be targets of terrorism 
our business is dependent on exchanges and market centers being able to process trades 
terrorist activities in september caused the us securities markets to close for four days 
this impacted our revenue and profitability for that period of time 
if future terrorist incidents cause interruption of market activity  our revenues and profits may be negatively impacted 
extreme market volatility may cause investors to avoid participation in equity markets  which could lead to substantially reduced trading volumes 
on may   the dow jones industrial average plunged over points and then rapidly rebounded 
this flash crash caused many investors and traders to reduce their trading activity in equity markets  or to suspend all trading activity 
any further market disruptions that cause investors and traders to reduce trading activity could lead to significantly reduced trading volumes  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
risks related to government regulation all aspects of our business are subject to extensive government regulation 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may be subject to disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations  and we could suffer significant reputational and financial loss 
the securities industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
in addition to these laws  we must comply with rules and regulations of the sec  nyse  finra  the cftc  the nfa  various stock and futures exchanges  state securities commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets 
broker dealers and fcms are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities and futures businesses  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers and fcms  use and safekeeping of investors funds and securities  
table of contents capital structure  margin lending  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of investor accounts 
our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of an effective compliance system as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed non compliance with these regulations in the future and even for the claimed non compliance of our correspondents with such regulations 
if a claim of non compliance is made by a regulatory authority  the efforts of our management could be diverted to responding to such a claim and we could be subject to a range of possible consequences  including the payment of fines and the suspension of one or more portions of our business 
additionally  our clearing contracts generally include automatic termination provisions which are triggered in the event we are suspended from any of the national exchanges of which we are a member for failure to comply with the rules or regulations thereof 
we and certain of our officers and employees have been subject to claims of non compliance in the past  and may be subject to claims and legal proceedings in the future 
we also operate clearing and related businesses in the uk  canada and australia and execute transactions in global markets 
these non us businesses are also heavily regulated 
to the extent that different regulatory regimes impose inconsistent or iterative requirements on the conduct of our business  we will face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts 
in addition  as we expand into new non us markets with which we may have relatively less experience  there is a risk that our lack of familiarity with the regulations impacting such markets may affect our performance and results 
the regulatory environment in which we operate has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and further changes in legislation or regulations may affect our ability to conduct our business or reduce our profitability 
the legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant change in the past and may undergo further change in the future 
the cftc  sec  nyse  finra  nfa  various securities or futures exchanges and other us and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations 
these legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable 
changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect our business 
certain regulatory authorities have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions against companies in our industry and penalties and fines sought by certain regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years 
in addition  because our industry is heavily regulated  regulatory approval may be required prior to expansion of our business activities 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any desired expansion 
even if approvals are obtained  they may impose restrictions on our business and could require us to incur significant compliance costs or adversely affect the development of business activities in affected markets 
recently enacted financial reform legislation and related regulations may negatively affect our business activities  results of operations and profitability 
while certain provisions of the dodd frank act will be effective immediately  many other provisions will be effective only following extended transition periods of varying lengths 
therefore  it is impractical at present to forecast the comprehensive effects of the legislation 
the dodd frank act also mandates the preparation of studies on a wide range of issues  which could lead to additional legislation or regulatory changes 
this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule making 
the legislation and regulation of financial institutions  both domestically and internationally  include calls to increase capital and liquidity requirements  limit the size and types of the activities permitted and increase taxes on some institutions 

table of contents while we are currently assessing the impact that these initiatives will have directly on our business  we are also assessing the indirect effect on us due to the impact on certain of our customers 
as a result of the effect of these new legislative and regulatory changes on our customers  our revenue may materially decrease  our ability to pursue certain business opportunities may be limited  we may be required to change certain of our business practices  we may incur significant additional costs and we may otherwise have our business adversely affected 
if we do not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our operations  we may be subject to fines  penalties or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred 
accordingly  we cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulation would not have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  profitability or financial condition 
if we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulations  we may be subject to fines  suspension  revocation of registration or expulsion by regulatory authorities 
we are subject to stringent rules imposed by the sec  nyse  finra  and various other regulatory agencies which require broker dealers to maintain specific levels of net capital 
net capital is the net worth of a broker dealer  less deductions  for other types of assets including assets not readily convertible into cash and specified percentages of a broker dealer s proprietary securities positions 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by nyse and or finra  which  if not cured  could ultimately lead to our liquidation 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against our net capital  we might be required to limit or discontinue our clearing and margin lending operations that require the intensive use of capital 
in addition  our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries could be restricted  which in turn could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay or repurchase debt  including the notes  at the parent company level and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if necessary 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could impede our ability to expand or even maintain our present volume of business 
our futures clearing business is subject to the capital and segregation rules of the nfa and cftc 
if we fail to maintain the required capital  or if we violate the customer segregation rules  we may be subject to monetary fines  and the suspension or revocation of our license to clear futures contracts 
any interruption in our ability to continue this business would impact our revenues and profitability 
outside of the us  we are subject to other regulatory capital requirements 
our uk subsidiary is subject to capital adequacy rules that require our subsidiary to maintain stockholders equity and qualifying subordinated loans at specified minimum levels 
if we fail to maintain the required regulatory capital  we may be subject to fine  suspension or revocation of our license with the fsa 
if our license is suspended or revoked or if the capital adequacy requirements are changed or expanded  we may be required to discontinue our uk operations  which could result in diminished revenues 
as a member of iiroc  an approved participant with the montreal exchange  a participating organization with the toronto stock exchange and a member of the tsx venture exchange and various canadian alternative trading systems  pfsc is subject to the rules and policies of iiroc and other rules relating to the maintenance of regulatory capital 
specifically  to ensure that the iiroc members will be able to meet liabilities as they become due  iiroc requires its investment dealer members to periodically calculate their risk adjusted capital in accordance with a prescribed formula 
if pfsc fails to maintain the required risk adjusted capital  it may be subject to monetary sanctions  suspensions or other sanctions  including expulsion as a member 
if pfsc is sanctioned or expelled or if the risk adjusted capital requirements are changed or expanded  pfsc may be required to discontinue operations in canada  which could result in diminished revenues 
pfsa holds an australian financial services license and is a market participant of the asx and is an asx clear participant 
as such  pfsa is subject to  amongst other things  the rules established by the asx and asx clear governing the minimum risk based capital requirements for participants in the asx and asx clear 
the asx clear capital requirements establish minimum core liquid capital requirements and minimum requirements for a participant s liquid capital as compared to a number of different risk based metrics which make up the participant s total risk requirement 
the risk requirements vary depending on the operations undertaken by the participant 
a participant s core liquid capital is based principally on a participant s equity and retained profits  while the liquid capital adjusts core liquid capital to take account of reserves and in certain cases subordinated debt and preferred 
table of contents stock 
if pfsa should fail to comply with the requirements of these various measures of capital  we may be required to discontinue our australian operations  which could result in diminished revenues 
in addition  some of the investments we make in our business may impact our regulatory capital 
we have made large investments into nexa and expect to continue to do so in the future 
investments in non regulated subsidiaries and increases in illiquid assets  including unsecured customer accounts decrease the capital available for our regulated subsidiaries 
if we experience increased levels of unsecured and partially secured accounts in the future  we could suffer significant financial loss 
procedures and requirements of the usa patriot act may expose us to significant costs or penalties 
as participants in the financial services industry  our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations  including the usa patriot act of  which require that they know certain information about their customers and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities 
the cost of complying with the patriot act and related laws and regulations is significant 
we may face particular difficulties in identifying our international customers  gathering the required information about them and monitoring their activities 
we face risks that our policies  procedures  technology and personnel directed toward complying with the patriot act are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties due to noncompliance 
such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and cash flows 
risks related to our corporate structure our discontinued operations expose us to legal and other risks 
in may   we completed the disposal by split off of certain non core business operations that were placed into the subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company known as samco holdings  inc samco 
our then existing stockholders exchanged million of samco net assets and million of cash for million penson shares 
the split off transaction was structured to be tax free to the company and our stockholders  and the net assets were distributed at net book value 
though there was substantial common ownership between the company and samco  we did not retain any ownership interest in samco  which is operated independently 
although the split off transaction occurred over three years ago  we may incur future liabilities related to the operations of the samco entities 
due to the company s indirect ownership of the samco entities prior to our initial public offering we may be exposed to additional liabilities beyond what we may ordinarily encounter in our typical customer relationships 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under delaware law may prevent or frustrate a change in control or a change in management that stockholders believe is desirable 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  limitations on the removal of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors at meetings of our stockholders  and the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings 
in addition  our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to institute a rights plan  or a poison pill  that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors 
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation 
in addition  absent approval of our board of 
table of contents directors  our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder  generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned of our voting stock  for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
accordingly  section may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
risks related to our requirements as a public company our stockholders could be harmed if our management and larger stockholders use their influence in a manner adverse to other stockholders interests 
at the date of this report  our executive officers  directors and stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders may have the ability to control all fundamental matters affecting us  including the election of the majority of the board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in our control even if beneficial to stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders with respect to such matters could conflict with the interests of public stockholders 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
since the completion of our initial public offering in may  the price at which our common stock has traded has been subject to significant fluctuation 
the price of our common stock may continue to be volatile in the future and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to reductions in market prices or volume  changes in securities or other government regulations  quarterly variations in operating results  our technological capabilities to accommodate any future growth in our operations or clients  announcements of technological innovations  new products  services  significant contracts  acquisitions or joint ventures by us or our competitors  issuance and sales of our securities in financing transactions  and changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to meet or exceed analyst estimates 
as a result  shareholders may be unable to sell their stock at or above the price they paid for it 
our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an attestation report as to their effectiveness  which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation 
we are continuously evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended sarbanes oxley act and rules and regulations of the sec thereunder  which we refer to as section while we have not identified material weaknesses to date  we may from time to time identify conditions that may result in material weaknesses

item legal proceedings in re sentinel management group  inc is a chapter bankruptcy case filed on august  in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois by sentinel 
prior to the filing of this action  penson futures and pffi held customer segregated accounts with sentinel totaling approximately million 
sentinel subsequently sold certain securities to citadel equity fund  ltd 
and citadel limited partnership 
on august   the bankruptcy court authorized distributions of percent of the proceeds sentinel received from the sale of those securities to certain fcm clients of sentinel  including penson futures and pffi 
this distribution to the penson futures and pffi customer segregated accounts along with a distribution received immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing totaled approximately million 
on may   a committee of sentinel creditors  consisting of a majority of non fcm creditors  together with the trustee appointed to manage the affairs and liquidation of sentinel the sentinel trustee  filed with the court their proposed plan of liquidation the committee plan and on may  filed a disclosure statement related thereto 
the committee plan allows the sentinel trustee to seek the return from fcms  including penson futures and pffi  of a portion of the funds previously distributed to their customer segregated accounts 
on june   the court entered an order approving the disclosure statement over objections by penson futures  pffi and others 
on september   the sentinel trustee filed suit against penson futures and pffi along with several other fcms that received distributions to their customer segregated accounts from sentinel 
the suit against penson futures and pffi seeks the return of approximately million of post bankruptcy petition transfers and approximately million of pre bankruptcy petition transfers 
the suit also seeks to declare that the funds distributed to the customer segregated accounts of penson futures and pffi by sentinel are the property of the sentinel bankruptcy estate rather than the property of customers of penson futures and pffi 
on december   over the objections of penson futures and pffi  the court entered an order confirming the committee plan  and the committee plan became effective on december  on january  penson futures and pffi filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the suit brought by the sentinel trustee 
also on january   penson futures  pffi and a number of other fcms that had placed customer funds with sentinel filed motions with the federal district court for the northern district of illinois  effectively asking the federal district court to remove the sentinel suits against the fcms from the bankruptcy court and consolidate them with other sentinel related actions pending in the federal district court 
on april   the sentinel trustee filed an amended complaint  which added a claim for unjust enrichment 
following an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss that claim on september   the court denied the motion for reconsideration without prejudice 
on september   penson futures and pffi filed their amended answer and amended affirmative defenses to the sentinel trustee s amended complaint 
on october   the federal district court for the northern district of illinois granted the motions of penson futures  pffi  and certain other fcm s requesting removal of the matters referenced above from the bankruptcy court  thereby removing these matters to the federal district court 
on february   the federal district court held a continued status hearing  during which penson futures  pffi and the sentinel trustee agreed that coordinated discovery with respect to the sentinel suits against the company and other fcms was still proceeding 
no trial date has been set 

table of contents in one of the actions brought by the sentinel trustee against an fcm whose customer segregated accounts received similar distributions to those made to the customer segregated accounts of penson futures and pffi  the sentinel trustee has brought a motion for summary judgment on certain counts asserted against such fcm that may implicate the claims brought by the sentinel trustee against the company 
there is no date set for the resolution of that motion 
the company believes that the court was correct in ordering the prior distributions and penson futures and pffi intend to continue to vigorously defend their position 
however  there can be no assurance that any actions by penson futures or pffi will result in a limitation or avoidance of potential repayment liabilities 
in the event that penson futures and pffi are obligated to return all previously distributed funds to the sentinel estate  any losses the company might suffer would most likely be partially mitigated as it is likely that penson futures and pffi would share in the funds ultimately disbursed by the sentinel estate

in the ensuing months  additional arbitration claims were filed against pfsi and certain of our directors and officers based upon substantially similar underlying facts 
these claims generally allege  among other things  that samco financial  in its capacity as broker  and pfsi  in its capacity as the clearing broker  failed to adequately supervise certain registered representatives of samco financial  and otherwise acted improperly in connection with the sale of these securities during the time period from approximately june  to may  claimants have generally requested compensation for losses incurred through the depreciation in market value or liquidation of the collateralized mortgage obligations  interest on any losses suffered  punitive damages  court costs and attorneys fees

during the third quarter of  the company s management determined that  based on the financial condition of the samco entities  sufficient risk existed with respect to the indemnification protections to warrant a modification of these arrangements with the samco entities  as described below 
on november   the company entered into a settlement agreement with certain of the samco entities pursuant to which the company received a limited personal guaranty from mr 
engemoen of certain of the indemnification obligations of various samco entities with respect to claims related to the underlying facts described above  and  in exchange  the company agreed to limit the aggregate indemnification obligations of the samco entities with respect to certain matters described above to  unpaid indemnification obligations of  were satisfied prior to february  of the  obligation   was satisfied through a setoff against an obligation owed to the samco entities by pfsi  with the balance paid in cash prior to december  effective as of december   the company and the samco entities entered into an amendment to the settlement agreement  whereby samco holdings  inc agreed to pay an additional  on the last business day of each of the first six calendar months of a total of

clients generating revenues for us from clearing transactions almost always also generate significant interest income from related balances 
revenues from clearing transactions are driven largely by the volume of trading activities of the customers of our correspondents and proprietary trading by our correspondents 
our average clearing revenue per trade is a function of numerous pricing elements that vary based on individual correspondent volumes  customer mix  and the level of margin debit balances and credit balances 
our clearing revenue fluctuates as a result of these factors as well as changes in trading volume 
we focus on maintaining the profitability of our overall correspondent relationships  including the clearing revenue from trades and net interest from related customer margin balances  and by reducing associated variable costs 
we collect the fees for our services directly from customer accounts when trades are processed 
we only remit commissions charged by our correspondents to them after deducting our charges 
we often refer to our interest income as interest  gross to distinguish this category of revenue from interest  net that is generally used in our industry 
interest  gross is generated by charges to customers or correspondents on margin balances and interest earned by investing customers cash  and therefore these revenues fluctuate based on the volume of our total margin loans outstanding  the volume of the cash balances we hold for our correspondents customers  the rates of interest we can competitively charge on margin loans and the rates at which we can invest such balances 
we also earn interest from our stock borrowing and lending activities 
technology revenues consist of transactional  development and licensing revenues generated by nexa 
a significant portion of these revenues are collected directly from clearing customers along with other charges for clearing services as described above 
most development revenues and some transaction revenues are collected directly from clients and are reflected as receivables until they are collected 
other revenues include charges assessed directly to customers for certain transactions or types of accounts  trade aggregation and profits from proprietary trading activities  including foreign exchange transactions and fees charged to our correspondents customers 
subject to certain exceptions  our clearing brokers in the us  canada  the uk and australia each generate these types of transactions 

table of contents revenues from clearing and commission fees represented  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense from securities operations interest expense is incurred in our daily operations in connection with interest we pay on credit balances we hold and on short term borrowings we enter into to fund activities of our correspondents and their customers 
we have two primary sources of borrowing commercial banks and stock lending institutions 
regulations differ by country as to how operational needs can be funded  but we often find that stock loans that are secured with customer or correspondent securities as collateral can be obtained at a lower rate of interest than loans from commercial banks 
operationally  we review cash requirements each day and borrow the requirements from the most cost effective source 
net interest income represented  and of our total net revenues for years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses employee compensation and benefits our largest category of expense is the compensation and benefits that we pay to our employees  which includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs  stock compensation and other related employee costs 
these costs vary by country according to the local prevailing wage standards 
we utilize technology whenever practical to limit the number of employees and thus keep costs competitive 
in the us  a majority of our employees are located in cities where employee costs are lower than where our largest competitors primarily operate 
a portion of total employee compensation is paid in the form of bonuses and performance based compensation 
as a result  depending on the performance of particular business units and the overall company performance  total employee compensation and benefits could vary materially from period to period 
other operating expenses expenses incurred to process trades include floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees  and those expenses tend to vary significantly with the level of trading activity 
the related data processing and communication costs vary less with the level of trading activity 
occupancy and equipment expenses include lease expenses for office space  computers and other equipment that we require to operate our businesses 
other expenses include legal  regulatory  professional consulting  accounting  travel and miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  as a public company  we incur additional costs for external advisers such as legal  accounting  auditing and investor relations services 
profitability of services provided management records revenue for the clearing operations and technology business separately 
we record expenses in the aggregate as many of these expenses are attributable to multiple business activities 
as such  net profitability before tax is determined in the aggregate 
we also separately record interest income and interest expense to determine the overall profitability of this activity

the addition of the ridge business in june resulted in higher clearing and commission fees of million and higher net interest revenues of million resulting in decreases to both revenue categories when compared to our existing business in the decline in clearing and commission fees resulted from weaker equity and options volumes in the us and canada

the decline in net interest revenues is primarily attributed to lower net spreads which were offset in part by higher average balances 
we also incurred higher operating expenses  primarily in employee compensation and benefits  communications and data processing  floor brokerage  exchange and clearance fees and interest expense on long term debt

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we believe the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to revenue recognition  fair value  software development and the valuation of stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from clearing transactions are recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements on a trade date basis 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
there are three major types of technology revenues completed products that are processing transactions every month generate revenues per transaction which are recognized on a trade date basis  these same completed products may also generate monthly terminal charges for the delivery of data or processing capability that are recognized in the month to which the charges apply  technology development services are recognized when the service is performed or under the terms of the technology development contract as described below 
interest and other revenues are recorded in the month that they are earned 
to date  the majority of our technology development contracts have not required significant production  modification or customization such that the service element of our overall relationship with the client generally does meet the criteria for separate accounting under the fasb codification 
all of our products are fully functional when initially delivered to our clients  and any additional technology development work that is contracted for is as outlined below 
technology development contracts generally cover only additional work that is performed to modify existing products to meet the specific needs of individual customers 
this work can range from cosmetic modifications to the customer interface private labeling to custom development of additional features requested by the client 
technology revenues arising from development contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis based on outputs unless there are significant uncertainties preventing the use of this approach in which case a completed contract basis is used 
the company s revenue recognition policy is consistent with applicable revenue recognition guidance in the fasb codification and staff accounting bulletin no

fair value fair value is defined as the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company s financial assets and liabilities are primarily recorded at fair value 
in determining fair value  the company uses various valuation approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches 
the fair value model establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs reflect the company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include corporate equity  us treasury and money market securities 
valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include certificates of deposit  term deposits  corporate debt securities and canadian government obligations 
these financial instruments are valued by quoted prices that are less frequent than those in active markets or by models that use various assumptions that are derived from or supported by data that is generally observable in the marketplace 
valuations in this category are inherently less reliable than quoted market prices due to 
table of contents the degree of subjectivity involved in determining appropriate methodologies and the applicable underlying assumptions 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data 
the company does not currently have any financial instruments utilizing level inputs 
these financial instruments have significant inputs that cannot be validated by readily determinable data and generally involve considerable judgment by management 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the financial assets carried at fair value 
software development costs associated with software developed for internal use are capitalized based on the applicable guidance in the fasb codification 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of software that do not meet the capitalization criteria  such as costs of activities performed during the preliminary and post implementation stages  are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in development and enhancements that do not meet the criteria to capitalize are activities performed during the application development stage such as designing  coding  installing and testing 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we review any impairment of the capitalized costs on a periodic basis 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
at december   our goodwill totaled million 
our assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  as a result of this test we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required 
stock based compensation the company s accounting for stock based employee compensation plans focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for employee services  and carries forward prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
under the modified prospective transition method  the company is required to recognize compensation cost  after the effective date  for the portion of all 
table of contents previously granted awards that were not vested  and the vested portion of all new stock option grants and restricted stock 
the compensation cost is based upon the original grant date fair market value of the grant 
the company recognizes expense relating to stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period 
forfeitures of unvested stock grants are estimated and recognized as a reduction of expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prior to the fourth quarter of  we did not have material exposure to reductions in the targeted federal funds rate 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  there were significant decreases in these rates 
we encountered a basis point decrease in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of actual rates fell approximately basis points during  to a federal funds rate of approximately 
as of december   which is the current rate as of december  based upon the december quarter average customer balances  assuming no increase  and adjusting for the timing of these rate reductions  we believe that each basis point increase or decrease will affect pretax income by approximately million per quarter 
despite such interest rate changes  we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes or similar market risks 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risk 
in addition  we do not maintain material inventories of securities for sale  and therefore are not subject to equity price risk 
we extend margin credit and leverage to our correspondents and their customers  which is subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
our directors and executive officers and their associates  including family members  from time to time may be or may have been indebted to one or more of our operating subsidiaries or one of their respective correspondents or introducing brokers  as customers  in connection with margin account loans 
such indebtedness is in the ordinary course of business  is on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated third parties who are not our employees and does not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a proportional amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of liquidation 
although we monitor margin balances on an intra day basis in order to control our risk exposure  we are not able to eliminate all risks associated with margin lending 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our correspondents customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  which can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we are indemnified and held harmless by our correspondents from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit  leverage and short sales of their customers 
however  if our correspondents do not have sufficient regulatory capital to cover such conditions  we may be exposed to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers and their correspondents fail to satisfy their obligations 
our account level margin credit and leverage requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve  or similar regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions 
the sec and other self regulated organizations sros have approved new rules permitting portfolio margining that have the effect of permitting increased leverage on securities held in portfolio margin accounts relative to non portfolio accounts 
we began offering portfolio margining to our clients in we intend to continue to meet or exceed any account level margin credit and leverage requirements mandated by the sec  other sros  or similar regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions as we expand the offering of portfolio margining to our clients 
the profitability of our margin lending activities depends to a great extent on the difference between interest income earned on margin loans and investments of customer cash and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances and borrowings 
if short term interest rates fall  we generally expect to receive a smaller gross interest spread  causing the profitability of our margin lending and other interest sensitive revenue sources to decline 
short term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions 
table of contents and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  decreases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve system usually lead to decreasing interest rates in the us  which generally lead to a decrease in the gross spread we earn 
this is most significant when the federal funds rate is on the low end of its historical range  as is the case now 
interest rates in canada  europe and australia are also subject to fluctuations based on governmental policies and economic factors and these fluctuations could also affect the profitability of our margin lending operations in these markets 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we may not be able to manage our currency transaction and or translation risks effectively  or volatility in currency exchange rates may expose our financial condition or results of operations to a significant additional risk
