item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of print and promotional procurement solutions to corporate clients across a wide range of industries 
we combine the talent of our employees with our proprietary technology  extensive supplier base and domain expertise to procure  manage and deliver printed products as part of a comprehensive outsourced enterprise solution 
our technology is designed to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional print supply chain to obtain favorable pricing and to deliver high quality products and services for our clients 
our proprietary software applications and database  ppm  create a fully integrated solution that stores  analyzes and tracks the production capabilities of our supplier network  as well as quote and price data for each bid we receive and print job we execute 
as a result  we believe ppm contains one of the largest independent repositories of equipment profiles and price data for print suppliers in the united states 
we leverage our technology to match each print job with the supplier that is optimally suited to meet the client s needs at a highly competitive price 
our procurement managers use ppm to manage the print procurement process from end to end 
through our supplier base of over  suppliers  we offer a full range of print  fulfillment and logistics services that allows us to procure printed products on virtually any substrate 
the breadth of our product offerings and services and the depth of our supplier network enable us to fulfill all of the print procurement needs of our clients 
by leveraging our technology platform  our clients are able to reduce overhead costs  redeploy internal resources and obtain favorable pricing and service terms 
in addition  our ability to track individual transactions and provide customized reports detailing print procurement activity on an enterprise wide basis provides our clients with greater visibility and control of their print expenditures 
we maintain sales offices in illinois  new york  new jersey  california  hawaii  michigan  minnesota  ohio  texas  pennsylvania  georgia  wisconsin  missouri and the united kingdom 
we believe the opportunity exists to expand our business into new geographic markets 
our objective is to continue to increase our sales in the major print markets in the united states and europe 
we intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets 
in addition  given that the print industry is a global business  over time we intend to evaluate opportunities to access attractive markets outside the united states 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale of printed products to our clients 
our revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and transactional 
enterprise jobs usually involve higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional jobs 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of printing services on a recurring basis  if the client has signed an open ended purchase order  or a series of related purchase orders  or if the client has enrolled in our e stores program  which enables the client to make online purchases o f printing services on a recurring basis 
we categorize all other clients as transactional 
we enter into contracts with our enterprise clients to provide some or a specific portion of their printed products on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients generally have an open ended term subject to termination by either party upon prior notice ranging from days to twelve months 
several of our enterprise clients have outsourced substantially all of their recurring print needs to us 
we provide printed products to our transactional clients on an order by order basis 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  while transactional clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of the prices paid by our clients for printed products 
these prices  in turn  reflect the amounts charged to us by our suppliers plus our gross profit 
our gross profit margin  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is fixed by contract or  in the case of transactional clients  is negotiated on a job by job basis 
once either type of client accepts our pricing terms  the selling price is established and we procure the product for our own account in order to re sell it to the client 
we take full title and risk of loss for the product upon shipment 
the finished product is typically shipped directly from our supplier to a destination specified by our client 
upon shipment  our supplier invoices us for its production costs and we invoice our client 
our revenue from enterprise clients tends to generate lower gross profit margins than our revenue from transactional clients because the gross profit margins established in our contracts with large enterprise clients are generally lower than the gross profit margins we typically realize in our transactional business 
although our enterprise revenue generates lower gross profit margins  our enterprise business tends to be as profitable as our transactional business on an operating profit basis because the commission expense associated with enterprise jobs is generally lower 
cost of goods sold and gross profit our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the price at which we purchase products from our suppliers 
our selling price  including our gross profit  in the case of some of our enterprise jobs  is based on a fixed gross margin established by contract or  in the case of transactional jobs  is determined at the discretion of the account executive or procurement manager within predetermined parameters 
our gross margins on our enterprise jobs are typically lower than our gross margins on our transactional jobs 
as a result  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for our enterprise jobs is typically higher than those for our transactional jobs 
our gross profit for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
operating expenses and income from operations our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of commissions paid to our account executives  compensation costs for our management team and procurement managers as well as compensation costs for our finance and support employees  public company expenses  and corporate systems  legal and accounting  facilities and travel and entertainment expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
we accrue for commissions when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our account executives receive a monthly draw to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
the cash paid to our account executives in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our account executives earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our prepaid commission balance was million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  we agree to provide our clients with printed products that conform to the industry standard of a commercially reasonable quality  and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality 
in addition  the quotes we execute with our clients include customary industry terms and conditions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects 
product defects have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are required to make payment to our suppliers for completed print jobs regardless of whether our clients make payment to us 
our bad debt expense was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our income from operations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title transfers  which occurs when the product is shipped either from a third party to the customer or shipped directly from our warehouse to the customer 
unbilled revenue relates to shipments that have been made to customers for which the related account receivable has not yet been billed 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  principal agent considerations and other presentation matters  we recognize revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because it bears the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  being responsible for fulfillment of the order  taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and marketing the products  among other things 
accounts receivable the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances and  based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
fully reserved receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis and uncollectible accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted 
at december   the gross accounts receiveable balance includes approximately of customer balances that are in excess of one year 
man agement believes any uncollectible amounts are adequately reserved for at december  goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identified assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we evaluate recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
for goodwill impairment test purposes  we have one reporting unit 
in the first step  the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
as a result of the analysis performed  no impairment charges were required 
as of december   our goodwill balance was million 
asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators exist 
our intangible assets consist of customer lists  trade names  noncompete agreements and patents 
our customer lists are being amortized using the economic useful life method over their estimated weighted average useful lives of approximately fourteen years 
our noncompete agreements  trade names and patents are being amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives 
as of december   the net balance of our intangible assets was million 
fair value of financial instruments we account for our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value within the financial statements in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosure 
asc requires enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements 
as of december   our financial assets primarily relate to our available for sale securities 
we utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
asc includes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
the fair value hierarchy is based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value 
observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity s pricing based upon its own market assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market corroborated inputs  which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level inputs that are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable 
stock based compensation we account for nonvested equity awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
compensation expense is measured by determining the fair value using the black scholes option valuation model and is then amortized over the vesting period of the stock options 
all stock based compensation expense is recorded net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate is based upon historical activity and is then analyzed annually and as actual forfeitures occur 
using the black scholes option valuation model we recorded million and million in compensation expense  including million and million in compensation expense related to restricted common share grants  in and  respectively

on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that matures on august  this agreement replaces our credit agreement with the same lenders and provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to million 
we had million in outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  outstanding borrowings may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes in the ordinary course of business  for permitted acquisitions  for capital expenditures and for restricted payments  including the repurchase of shares of our comm on stock  as permitted pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
our obligations under the credit agreement and such domestic subsidiaries guaranty obligations are secured by substantially all of their respective assets 
interest is payable at the adjusted libor or the alternate base rate  as elected 
the terms of the revolving credit facility include various covenants  including covenants that requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these various covenants 
we will continue to utilize cash to fund acquisitions of or make strategic investments in complementary businesses and to expand our sales force

see note summary of significant accounting policies acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued update  asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to existing multiple element arrangement guidance 
the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables 
these changes are likel y to result in earlier recognition of revenue for multiple element arrangements than under previous guidance 
this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  this standard is not expected to have a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  that amends existing disclosure requirements under asc by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy  adding separate disclosures about purchase  sales  issuances  and settlements relative to level measurements  and clarifying  among other things  the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation 
this asu is effective for the first quarter of  except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which is effective beginning the first quarter of since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only  its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are dependent upon the availability of paper  and paper prices represent a substantial portion of the cost of our products 
the supply and price of paper depend on a variety of factors over which we have no control  including environmental and conservation regulations  natural disasters and weather 
we believe a increase in the price of paper would not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated statements of income or cash flows  as these costs are generally passed through to our clients 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
interest is payable at the adjusted libor rate or the alternate base 
assuming our million revolving credit facility was fully drawn  a increase in the interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by million 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  in particular because all of our investments are in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the average duration of all of our investements as of december  was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
foreign currency risk a portion of our sales and earnings are attributable to operations conducted outside of the united states 
the united states dollar value of sales and earnings of these operations varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe a fluctuation in the currency exchange rate would not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated statements of income or cash flows 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
