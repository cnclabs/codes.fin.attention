item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k report  including the m anagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of juniper networks  inc we  us  or the company that are based on our current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about our business  our results of operations  the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  would  could  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results m ay differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the sec  specifically our most recent reports on form q 
while forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made  you should not rely on them 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our co nsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of share based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolida ted financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 

table of contents executive overview in  we experienced a year over year increase in net revenues across all regions and in both the enterprise and service provider markets 
these increases reflect growing market demand for networking and security products as our customers expand their networks and the recovering global economy 
additionally  while our net revenues grew  we continued to control costs as we invested in our innovation and customer satisfaction initiatives 
the following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended december   and in millions  except per share amounts and percentages change change net revenues operating income percentage of net revenues net income attributable to juniper networks percentage of net revenues net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders basic diluted net revenues our net revenues increased across all three regions  in both the service provider and enterprise markets  in compared to these increases were primarily due to increased demand for our most recent product lines  the mx series routers  ex series switches  and srx service gateways  and the improved macroeconomic env ironment 
operating income our operating income as well as operating margin increased in compared to the increase was  in large part  due to the increase in sales  a change in customer demand that favored higher margin products  and our continued efforts to control expenses and improve efficiencies 
additionally  was impacted by million in litigation settlement charges 
net income attributable to juniper netwo rks and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stock holders the increase in net income attributable to juniper networks and net income per share attributable to juniper networks common stockholders in compared to is primarily due to the increase in operating income and a non recurring income tax expense and benefit recorded in and  respectively  from changes in the estimate of unrecognized tax benefits related to share based compensation 
these changes were the result of decisions made by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit in xilinx inc v 
commissioner 
stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million in the year ended december  other financial highlights total deferred revenue increased million in  primarily due to an increase in deferred product revenue from undelivered product commitments and an increase in deferred service revenue  largely due to higher sales of service contracts and multi year service billings 
business and market environment we design  develop  and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience  and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 
table of contents preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future consolidated results of operations may be affected 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we generally rely upon sales contracts  or agreements and customer purchase orders  to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or deter minable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of customer as determined by our credit checks and their payment histories 
we record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated customer returns  and pricing credits 
we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and asu no 
 topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal f or new and materially modified arrangements originating after december  under the new standards  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery 
for fiscal and future periods  pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  and software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
however  as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality  the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained 
additionally  as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand alone basis  we are not typically able to determine tpe 
when determining the best estimate of selling price  we apply management judgment by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels  gross margin objectives  internal costs  competitor pricing strategies  and industry technology lifecycles 
for transactions initiated prior to january   revenue for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  is allocated to each element using the residual method based on the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to asc topic software revenue recognition 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
as a result of the adoption of asu and asu  net revenue for the year ended december   was approximately million higher than the net revenue that would have been recorded under the previous 
table of contents accounting rules 
the increase in revenue was due to recognition of revenue for products shipped du ring the period which included approximately million in the year ended december   related to undelivered product commitments for which we were unable to demonstrate fair value pursuant to the previous accounting standards 
the remainder of the increase in revenue for the year was due to products sold into multiple year service arrangements which was recognized ratably under the previous accounting standards and for the change in our allocation methodology from the residual method to the relative selling price method as prescribed by asu we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature an d volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period as well as on changes in our business practices 
however  as asu and asu would allow us to recognize revenue for the portion allocated to delivered items in multiple element arrangements and defer revenue for only the portion allocated to the undelivered items  we expect that the magnitude of deferrals related to undelivered product commitments and other items  for which we previously would not have been able to establish vsoe  will gradually decrease over time 
we account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling pric es are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users  value added resellers  and original equipment manufacturers oem partners  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
our agreements with oem partners may allow future rights of returns 
additionally  a portion of our sales are made throu gh distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through 
deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
management judgment with respect to the amount of these reductions is based on historical s ales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
in addition  we report revenue net of sales taxes 
service revenues include revenue from maintenance  training  and professional services 
maintenance is offered under renewable contracts 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual perio d  which is generally one year or less 
we sell certain accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company 
we record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt 
n bsp  contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers  and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in china  malaysia  mexico  and the united states 
we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from our independent contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
our independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs  and standards that we establish  and they procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are our estimates of future demand for our products  based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish a provision for inventory  carrying costs  and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component 
table of contents usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we may incur charges for excess components  which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times 
warranty costs 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  labor costs for customer support  and overhead at the time revenue is recognized 
material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period 
technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and proce sses  if actual product failure rates  use of materials  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  additional warranty costs may be incurred  which could reduce gross margin 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating impairment o f goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis  as well as when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a sustained decline in our market capitalization  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry  or iv failure to meet our forecasted operating results 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during analysis 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of november st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit carrying value  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income and the market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
if the fair value of the reportin g unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
when the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered imp aired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate and the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
if our actual re sults or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
share based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards includ ing employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards psas  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation asc topic 
share based compensation expense for expected to vest share based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
we utilize the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options 
the bsm model requir es various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected option life  and risk free interest rate 
the expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock  adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the expected life of an award is 
table of contents based on historical experience  the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised 
we determine the fair value of rsus and psas based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
in addition  we estimate share based compensation expense for our psas based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent u ncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change and different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded share based compensation expense could be different 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in asc topic income taxes asc topic 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely tha n not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance is reversed  resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under asc topic and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves under asc topic are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made  as it was during the first quarter of when we recorded a non recurring income tax benefit as a result of a taxpayer favorable federal appellate court ruling in xilinx  inc v 
commissioner 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under asc topic and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information av ailable to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our 
table of contents current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses

we experienced an increase in product revenue from the enterprise market in compared to  primarily due to the growth in our ex series switching business and our continued focus on selling infrastructure products into the enterprise market  which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in americas and apac 
geographically  infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in we track infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network grow th 
most of our infrastructure product platforms are modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period

we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant

based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options  rsus  and psas counting only the on target measure of such psas  we achieved that goal with res pect to  and we believe we are on track with respect to this goal for based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next months 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period 
however  our future liquidity and capital requirements may v ary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products  the mix of product sales  and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditures  and r d plans  repurchases of our common stock  incurrence and repayment of debt  litigation expenses  settlements  and judgments  or similar items related to resolution of tax audits  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products  or technologies  changes in our compensation policies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers  partners  and customers  possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories

the value of our investments is subject to market price volatility 
in addition  as of december   over of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio 
we do not curr ently hedge these interest rate exposures 
we recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended december    and  related to the sales of our investments

these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months 
our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our cost of service revenue and operating 
table of contents expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses
