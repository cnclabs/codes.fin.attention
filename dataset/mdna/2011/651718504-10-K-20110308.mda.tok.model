item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
overview we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier  and have three reportable segments fluids systems and engineering  mats and integrated services  and environmental services 
we provide these products and services principally to the oil and gas exploration e p industry domestically in the us gulf coast  west texas  oklahoma  east texas  north louisiana  rocky mountains  and northeast regions  as well as internationally in certain areas of europe  north africa  brazil  canada and mexico 
further  we are expanding our presence outside the e p sector through our mats and integrated services segment  where we are marketing to utilities  municipalities and government sectors  both domestically and internationally 
our north american operations generated of total reported revenues for  and our consolidated revenues by segment are as follows in thousands fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues our operating results depend  to a large extent  on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
the drilling activity in turn  depends on oil and gas commodity pricing  inventory levels and demand  and more recently  regulatory actions affecting operations in the gulf of mexico 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average north american rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows year ended december  vs vs count count us rig count canadian rig count total source baker hughes incorporated north american drilling activity declined dramatically during from the elevated levels experienced in in response to these declines  we executed cost reduction programs during including workforce reductions  reduced discretionary spending and salary reductions 
as part of this cost reduction program  we reduced our north american workforce by employees 
as a result  operating results for include million of charges associated with employee termination and related costs 
in april  the deepwater horizon drilling rig sank in the gulf of mexico after an explosion and fire  resulting in the discharge of oil from the well 
following the deepwater horizon oil spill  the department of interior of the us government took several actions aimed at restricting and temporarily prohibiting certain drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
while the department of interior has since announced the formal end of the drilling moratorium placed in effect in may  increased permitting requirements are applicable to both shallow water and deepwater drilling activities 
as a result  the near term outlook for drilling activity in the gulf of mexico remains uncertain 

table of contents we generated approximately million of revenues within the areas of the gulf of mexico impacted by the restrictions during  including million of revenue generated directly related to the deepwater horizon oil spill 
we expect revenues generated from the affected areas of the gulf of mexico to be significantly lower in  particularly in the environmental services business  as compared to the levels achieved in year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results of operations summarized results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are as follows year ended december  vs in thousands revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses other operating income  net operating income loss    nm foreign currency exchange gain interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes    nm provision for income taxes    nm income loss from continuing operations    nm nm not meaningful revenues revenues increased to million in  compared to million in this increase in revenues is primarily driven by the improvement in the us rig count  along with our expansion into new markets and market share gains  including increased revenues of million from east texas and north louisiana  million from the northeast us region and million from brazil 
additional information regarding the change in revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase is primarily driven by the increase in revenues  partially offset by a change in revenue mix  along with the benefits of the cost reduction programs  workforce reductions and non recurring employee termination and related costs recorded in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in additional information regarding the change in cost of revenues is provided within the operating segment results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million for the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in performance based employee incentive costs in  partially offset by the impact of cost reduction programs implemented during

other income  net was million during  including million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims within our environmental services business 
foreign currency exchange foreign currency exchange was a million gain in  compared to a million gain in  reflecting the impact of currency fluctuations on our non functional currency denominated assets and liabilities within our foreign operations 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in includes a million charge for the termination of our interest rate swap agreements associated with the term loan

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for was a million expense  reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to a million benefit for  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the low effective tax benefit rate in is primarily due to losses generated in certain foreign countries for which the recording of a tax benefit is not permitted  as well as the recording of valuation allowances against a previously recognized net operating loss carryforward tax asset in canada  which serve to reduce the effective tax benefit rate in the period 
operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of inter segment transfers year ended december  vs in thousands revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues operating income loss fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services corporate office operating income loss segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services 
table of contents fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands drilling fluids and engineering completion fluids and services industrial minerals total north america mediterranean brazil total north america revenues increased to million for  as compared to million for of this million increase  drilling fluids and engineering revenues increased million  largely attributable to the increase in the us rig count  along with expansion in the northeast us region and market share gains in east texas and north louisiana 
our completion fluids and services activity was up and our wholesale industrial minerals revenues were up  both driven by the increased activity levels 
internationally  revenues were up to million for  as compared to million for  primarily due to a million increase from brazil resulting from continued market share gains 
mediterranean revenue is down primarily due to the impact of the strengthening us dollar  as revenues were relatively unchanged in local currency terms 
operating income operating income for this segment was million in  reflecting an improvement of million from a million operating profit in substantially all of this improvement was provided by the north american operations  which generated a million improvement in operating income 
this improvement is primarily attributable to the incremental profit from the million increase in revenues described above  combined with operating expense reductions from programs implemented during  and million of charges in the period associated with employee terminations 
operating income from international operations increased million  including a million increase in brazil  as a result of higher revenues in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of long lived assets within our brazil operation  of which million consists of property  plant and equipment 
in  our brazil operation generated a full year operating loss of million 
while the operating results from this operation are expected to improve in the future and management currently believes that the carrying value of the long lived assets is recoverable  an impairment of the long lived assets in a future period is possible if current expectations change and management s outlook for the brazil operation deteriorates 
in early  several international markets in which we operate  including tunisia  egypt and libya experienced political unrest  which may negatively impact our operating results as compared to during  revenues from these three countries along with algeria represented approximately of total segment revenues  with no individual country representing more than of total segment revenues 

table of contents mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total the million increase in mat rental and integrated services revenue is primarily driven by a million increase in mat rentals in the northeast us region  partially offset by a million decline in rental and service revenues in colorado and a million decrease in the gulf coast region 
mat sales increased million  as demand for these products has improved from the e p and other industries  following the economic downturn in operating income segment operating income increased by million to million for this improvement in operating income is primarily attributable to the million increase in revenues  along with million in operating expense reductions following cost reduction programs 
fiscal included million of employee termination costs and million of non cash write downs of inventory 
operating income in benefited from a higher mix of mat rental activity 
incremental margins on mat rentals are stronger than mat sales or service activities  due to the fixed nature of operating expenses  including depreciation expense on the rental mat fleet 
as a result  we experienced significantly higher operating margins in  as compared to additionally  included million of other income reflecting proceeds from insurance claims and the settlement of a lawsuit against a former vendor 
environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste gulf coast e p waste west texas norm and industrial waste total environmental services revenues increased to million in  as compared to the million increase in revenues from the prior year included million of revenues from the deepwater horizon oil spill 
revenues from non oil spill activities declined by million in  primarily reflecting the impact of us government restrictions on drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
operating income environmental services operating income increased by million in  partially driven by the million increase in revenues compared to in addition  operating expenses are down million in  including a million reduction in equipment rental expenses  following the non renewal of barge leases in operating income in includes million of proceeds from business interruption insurance claims 

table of contents in addition to the million of revenues generated directly from the deepwater horizon oil spill  approximately of revenues for this segment were derived from areas of the gulf of mexico affected by the us government restrictions 
we expect significant declines in revenues generated directly from the deepwater horizon oil spill and in non oil spill revenues generated in the area affected by the us government restrictions in due to the fixed nature of the majority of our operating expenses in this segment  we expect any reduction in segment revenues to have a high incremental impact on segment operating income

operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of inter segment transfers year ended december  vs in thousands revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues operating loss income fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services corporate office operating loss income segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services 
table of contents fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands drilling fluids and engineering completion fluids and services industrial minerals total north america mediterranean brazil total north america revenues decreased to million in  as compared to million in drilling fluids and engineering revenues decreased  which is largely attributable to the decline in industry drilling activity noted above  along with increased pricing pressure resulting from the depressed activity levels 
north american completion fluids and services and wholesale industrial minerals revenues were down a combined  also driven by the lower industry activity and pricing pressure 
mediterranean revenues decreased in compared to  due to the impact of the strengthening us dollar  as revenue levels increased in local currency terms from to brazil revenues increased to million in  reflecting the ramp up in activity under contracts entered into during operating income operating income for this segment decreased million in compared to  on a million decrease in revenues 
the majority of this decline is attributable to the north american operations  which generated an million decline in operating income on a million decrease in revenues 
this decrease in operating income is the result of the decline in north american drilling activity in  and the related increase in pricing pressure from competition 
further  the benefits of cost reduction initiatives taken during had limited impact on full year results due to the timing of the actions  which resulted in only partial year benefits to  along with million of charges associated with employee termination and related costs  as the north american workforce of this business was reduced by employees during this period 
operating income was further negatively impacted by lower gross profit on industrial mineral sales 
following the execution of significant cost reduction programs in the first half of  and the stabilization of north american rig activity during the second half of  the north american operating income improved from the levels generated during the first half of the year 
specifically  north american operating income in this segment increased by million from the first half of to the second half of operating income from international operations decreased million on a million increase in revenues 
the mediterranean region operating income increased million during this period  however  this increase was more than offset by a million decrease in brazil 
the operating loss in brazil is the result of the ramp up in personnel and facility costs for this operation  in advance of future anticipated revenues under existing contracts  along with an unfavorable sales mix 

table of contents mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total the million decrease in mat rental and integrated services revenues in is primarily attributable to declines in the us market served by this segment  particularly in the us gulf coast region 
the decline in revenue is further impacted by the increased pricing competition following the declines in market activity  and timing of projects from customers outside the e p industry 
mat sales primarily consist of export sales of composite mats to various international markets  as well as to non oilfield industries domestically 
mat sales decreased by million to million in compared to the year over year decline is driven by reduced demand for these products from the e p and utility industries  as well as governmental sectors in the current economic environment 
operating income mats and integrated services operating income decreased by million in  on a million decrease in revenues compared to the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the declines in revenues and pricing pressures  which was partially offset by cost reductions 
the benefits of cost reduction initiatives taken during  including workforce reductions of employees  had a limited impact on the full year operating results  due to the timing of the actions  which resulted in only partial year benefits to  along with million of charges associated with employee termination costs and million of non cash write downs of inventory 
of the million operating loss generated by this segment in  million was generated during the first half of the year  during which time the cost reduction actions were being executed 
environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste gulf coast e p waste west texas norm and industrial waste total e p waste revenues in the us gulf coast region decreased to million in compared to million in volumes processed by this region declined during this period  reflective of the decline in us gulf coast industry rig activity 
this decline in volumes processed was partially offset by changes in sales mix and pricing increases 
e p waste revenues in west texas decreased by to million in compared to million in the decline in revenues is driven by a decrease in volumes processed during this period along with a decline in revenues from the sale of oil  which is recovered as part of the waste disposal process 

table of contents norm and industrial waste revenues increased by to million in  compared to million in this increase is driven by higher volumes processed  as activity levels tend to fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of customer projects 
operating income environmental services operating income decreased by million on a million decline in revenues in  compared to the results include million of income associated with the settlement of business interruption insurance claims resulting from hurricanes and storms in the results include a million charge to write down certain disposal assets  following the abandoned sale of the business in the fourth quarter of the remaining decline of million is attributable to the lower revenue levels  partially offset by million of operating expense reductions  including reductions in transportation costs  personnel expenses  and rent expense following the non renewal of barge leases during the second half of liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
net income adjusted for non cash items generated million of cash during the period  while changes in operating assets and liabilities used million of cash 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the period reflected the impact of increased revenues  including million from increases in receivables  and million in increases in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and million in increases in accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities during in was million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  which includes million of net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured convertible senior notes senior notes and million of net repayments of term loans and our revolving credit facility 
additional information on these transactions is included below 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for our operations will fluctuate with our sales activity in the near term 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  which includes a new enterprise wide operational and financial system  additional investments in our manufacturing and research and development facilities  as well as additions to our composite mat rental fleet 
our capitalization was as follows as of december in thousands senior notes term loan revolving credit facility foreign bank lines of credit other total stockholder s equity total capitalization total debt to capitalization in october  we completed the sale and issuance of senior notes due october  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning april  holders may convert the senior notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the october  maturity date 
the conversion rate is initially shares of company common stock per  principal amount of senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to 
table of contents adjustment in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  the senior notes will be settled in shares of the company s common stock 
the company may not redeem the senior notes at its election prior to their maturity date 
we received net proceeds of million from the senior notes issuance in october  reduced by million for the underwriters discounts and commissions  which were capitalized as part of the transaction 
following the october funding of this offering  net proceeds were used to fully repay the revolving credit facility balance and the million term loan balance 
additionally  as a result of the repayment of the term loan  the cash flow hedge agreement was terminated and settled for million  resulting in a million charge to interest expense in our revolving credit facility facility expires in december under the terms of the facility  we can elect to borrow at an interest rate either based on libor plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio  ranging from to basis points  or at an interest rate based on the greatest of a prime rate  b the federal funds rate in effect plus basis points  or c the eurodollar rate for a eurodollar loan with a one month interest period plus basis points  in each case plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
the applicable margin on libor borrowings at december  was basis points 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility of basis points 
the facility contains certain financial covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  and a maximum funded debt to capitalization ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   and expect to remain in compliance through december  the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances under our credit agreement including the interest rate swaps as of december  was 
the facility is a senior secured obligation  secured by first liens on all of our us tangible and intangible assets  including our accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  a portion of the capital stock of our non us subsidiaries has also been pledged as collateral 
as of december   we have million of cash and cash equivalents in our us operations as well as million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
cash on hand  availability under credit agreements and expected cash generated by our us operations is expected to be adequate to fund our us capital needs without remitting foreign earnings which are deemed to be permanently reinvested abroad 
our foreign fluid systems and engineering subsidiaries in italy and brazil maintain local credit arrangements consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  which are renewed on an annual basis 
we utilize local financing arrangements in our foreign operations in order to provide short term liquidity needs  as well as to reduce the net investment in foreign operations subject to foreign currency risk 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of the subsidiary s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate for the million and million outstanding under these arrangements was and at december  and  respectively 
additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding relating to foreign operations 
on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the drilling fluids and engineering services unit of rheochem plc  a publicly traded australian based oil and gas company 
rheochem provides drilling fluids and related engineering services to the oil and gas exploration and geothermal industries with operations in australia  new zealand and india 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay approximately a million at closing  subject to typical adjustments for working capital 
additional consideration may be payable based on financial results of the acquired business over a one year earnout period  up to a maximum total consideration of a million 
newpark expects to fund the acquisition price  including any earnout payment  from cash on hand 
in the most recently completed fiscal year ended june   rheochem plc s drilling fluid services segment generated revenues of a million 
this acquisition is expected to be completed during the second quarter of off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with our insurance programs  we had established letters of credit in favor of certain insurance companies in the amount of million at december  and in addition  as of december   we 
table of contents had established other letters of credit in favor of our suppliers in the amount of million 
we also had million and million in guarantee obligations in connection with facility closure bonds and other performance bonds issued by insurance companies outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
other than normal operating leases for office and warehouse space  barges  rolling stock and other pieces of operating equipment  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or special purpose entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 
contractual obligations a summary of our outstanding contractual and other obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total current maturities of long term debt long term debt including capital leases interest on senior notes foreign bank lines of credit operating leases trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities purchase commitments  not accrued other long term liabilities performance bond obligations letter of credit commitments total contractual obligations the above table does not reflect expected tax payments and uncertain tax positions due to the inability to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing and amount to be paid 
for additional discussion on uncertain tax positions  see note income taxes to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item in this report 
we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows  available cash on hand  and availability under our existing credit agreement 
the specific timing of settlement for certain long term obligations can not be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states us gaap  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts and disclosures reported 
significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include the following allowances for sales returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for self insured retentions under insurance programs  estimated performance and values associated with employee incentive programs  fair values used for goodwill impairment testing  undiscounted cash flows used for impairment testing of long lived assets and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies as well as government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in the financial condition of our customers or political changes in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
for  and  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for sales returns we maintain reserves for estimated customer returns of unused materials in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
the reserves are established based upon historical customer return levels and estimated gross profit levels attributable to product sales 
future customer return levels may differ from the historical return rate 
impairments of long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of november  or more frequently  if an indication of impairment exists 
the impairment test includes a comparison of the carrying value of net assets of our reporting units  including goodwill  with their estimated fair values  which we determine using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we identify our reporting units based on our analysis of several factors  including our operating segment structure  evaluation of the economic characteristics of our geographic regions within each of our operating segments  and the extent to which our business units share assets and other resources 
we determine the impairment of goodwill by comparing the carrying amounts of our reporting units with fair values  which we estimate using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
in completing our november   evaluation  we determined that each reporting unit s fair value was substantially in excess of the net carrying value and therefore  no impairment was required 
we review property  plant and equipment  finite lived intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows 
in estimating expected cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
insurance we maintain reserves for estimated future payments associated with our self insured employee healthcare programs  as well as the self insured retention exposures under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
our reserves are determined based on historical cost experience under these programs  including estimated development of known claims under these programs and estimated incurred but not reported claims 
required reserves could change significantly based upon changes in insurance coverage  loss experience or inflationary impacts 
as of december  and  total insurance reserves were million and million  respectively 
income taxes we have total deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
at december   a total valuation allowance of million was recorded  substantially all of which offsets million of net operating loss carryforwards for state tax 
table of contents purposes  as well as foreign jurisdictions  including brazil  canada  and mexico 
no valuation allowance is recorded for our us net operating loss carryforward 
changes in the expected future generation of qualifying taxable income within these jurisdictions or in the realizability of other tax assets may result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would be charged or credited to income in the period this determination was made 
specifically  we have a million valuation allowance recorded on the net operating loss carryforward in brazil which could be reversed in the future  depending on our ability to generate taxable income 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
it replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant  and they establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and they significantly expand the required disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amendments are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  and we do not expect the impact of this additional guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to the calculation of the carrying amount of a reporting unit when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test 
specifically  this update requires an entity to use an equity premise when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test and if a reporting unit has a zero or negative carrying amount  the entity must assess and consider qualitative factors and whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the new accounting guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early application is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
these disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
the new accounting guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
the impact of this adoption will be evaluated as business combinations occur 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  including million of borrowings under our senior notes  bearing interest at a fixed rate of and million of borrowings under foreign bank lines of credit  which bear interest at variable rates 
due to the limited borrowing currently outstanding under variable rate agreements  interest rate risk is minimal 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in certain areas of europe and north africa  brazil  canada  uk and mexico 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are conducted principally in the foreign currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate which include european euros  canadian dollars and brazilian reais 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments 
unremitted foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad upon which deferred income taxes have not been provided aggregated approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have the ability and intent to leave these foreign earnings permanently reinvested abroad
