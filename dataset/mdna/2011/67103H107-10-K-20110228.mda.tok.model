overview we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment and accessories in the united states 
we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers  selling our products to both do it yourself diy customers and professional service providers 
our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials  automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment 
as of december   we operated  stores in states 
operating within the retail industry  we  along with other retail companies  are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including  but not limited to  fuel costs  unemployment rates  consumer preferences and spending habits and competition 
the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general 
we cannot predict whether  when  or the manner in which  these economic conditions will change 
we believe that the number of us miles driven  number of us registered vehicles  average vehicle age  new light vehicle sales  unperformed maintenance  unemployment and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket 
number of miles driven total miles driven in the us  along with changes in the average age of vehicles on the road  heavily influence the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell 
historically  the long term trend in the total miles driven in the us has steadily increased 
according to the department of transportation  between and  the total number of miles driven in the us increased at an average annual rate of approximately 
in  however  difficult macroeconomic conditions and record high gas prices during the first half of the year led to a decrease in the number of miles driven and in  miles driven remained relatively flat 
through november of  miles driven in the us increased by with miles driven increasing each month since march 
as the us economy recovers  we believe that annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to increase the demand for our products 

table of contents number of us registered vehicles and new light vehicle sales as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia  the total number of vehicles on the road in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade  with the total number of registered vehicles increasing  from million light vehicles in to million in new light vehicle sales  however  have declined over the past decade 
between and  new car sales in the us decreased by  from million in to million vehicles in due to the recent difficult macroeconomic environment in the us  new light vehicles sales declined by in to million and declined by in to million vehicles  which is the lowest level in the past decade 
based on the current economic environment  we believe new light vehicle sales will remain below historic levels and consumers will continue to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher miles  continuing the trend of an aging vehicle population 
average vehicle age of registered vehicles as reported by the aaia  the average age of the us vehicle population has increased over the past decade from years for passenger cars and years for light trucks in to and years in  respectively 
we believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and built vehicles  which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains  and interiors and exteriors  the decrease in new car sales over the past two years and the consumers willingness to invest in maintaining their higher mileage  better built vehicles 
as the average age of the vehicle on the road increases  a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of manufacturer warranty 
these out of warranty  older vehicles generate strong demand for our products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles  have more frequent mechanical failures which require replacement parts and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles would require 
unperformed maintenance according to estimates compiled by the automotive aftermarket suppliers association  the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the us totaled billion for versus billion for this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed 
consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products  and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand 
we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions beginning in contributed to the increased amount of unperformed maintenance in  however  with the reduced number of new car sales and consumers increased focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment  we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance decreased in  resulting in a strong year in the automotive aftermarket 
unemployment challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment 
monthly us unemployment rates for ranged from to 
we believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending 
we also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle 
while the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance  long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits  both of which could negatively impact our business 
product quality differentiation we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer 
for many of our product offerings  this quality differentiation reflects good  better  and best alternatives 
our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products 
consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry 
we believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions 
we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers 
key events and recent developments several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below since july   and as a result of the csk acquisition  we have incurred and may continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against csk and former csk employees 
o reilly and the doj have now agreed in principle  subject to final documentation  to resolve the doj investigation of csk s legacy accounting practices 
based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement  we have recorded a charge of million for the year ended december   in anticipation of the doj  csk and o reilly executing a non prosecution agreement 

table of contents on july   we agreed to become a guarantor  on a subordinated basis  of the million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due the notes originally issued by csk 
the notes were exchangeable  under certain circumstances  into cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes bore interest at per year until december   and until maturity 
during  all holders of the notes exercised their right to exchange and on december   the notes were retired 
in march of  the president of the united states of america signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of the acts 
the provisions of the acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short term 
however  the potential long term impacts of the acts to our business and consolidated financial statements  while currently uncertain  are being evaluated by management 
we will continue to assess how the acts apply to us  their effect on our business and how we plan to best meet the stated requirements 
on december   we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure the reorganization 
the reorganization was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under section of the general corporation law of the state of missouri which did not require a vote of the shareholders 
as a result of the reorganization  the previous parent company and registrant o reilly automotive  inc old o reilly was renamed o reilly automotive stores  inc and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant  which was renamed o reilly automotive  inc on january   we announced a new board approved share repurchase program the repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock over a three year period 
stock repurchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time as we deem appropriate  solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices  and we may increase or otherwise modify the repurchase program at any time without prior notice 
on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due the senior notes in the public market  of which we  and certain of our subsidiaries  are the guarantors and umb bank  na umb is trustee 
the senior notes bear interest at which is payable on january and july of each year  beginning on july  the senior notes mature on july  proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facility  pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes 
concurrent with the closing and issuance of the senior notes  on january   we entered into a credit agreement for a million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver arranged by bank of america  na ba and barclays capital barclays and simultaneously retired our existing secured revolving credit facility

table of contents compared to sales sales increased million  or  from billion in to billion in the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in comparable store sales stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales sales of stores opened throughout non store sales including machinery  sales to independent parts stores and team members sales in for stores that have closed total increase in sales comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores  sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion 
comparable store sales increased for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers 
the improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values 
we believe that the increase in transaction counts is a result of the customer s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles  the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired csk markets 
the improvement in average ticket value is primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories 
store growth at december   we operated  stores compared to  stores at december  we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to net new stores in versus net new stores in gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix  lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores  partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers 
the improvement in product mix is primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories  which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories 
increasing hard part sales are the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retain their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the csk stores  supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network 
lower product acquisition costs are derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of csk 
the benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarter of as compared to the same periods in when we renegotiated these vendor contracts 
our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of reflect comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage 
the decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores is the result of the more robust o reilly point of sale system pos  which was installed in all csk stores when they converted to the o reilly distribution systems 
the o reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage 
commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets  which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas 
commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than diy sales  as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers  and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales 
the reduced leverage on distribution center costs is the result of the additional distribution centers  which have been opened in conjunction with the csk integration plan 
new team members in these distribution centers are not yet fully proficient with distribution operations  resulting in inefficiencies 
we believe that the long term impact of the improved 
table of contents negotiating leverage with our vendors will allow us to generate gross margins at levels comparable to our full year results going forward  however continued growth in our commercial sales  as a percent of the total sales mix  will continue to pressure our gross margin results in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased approximately million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in total sg a dollars is primarily the result of additional employees  facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired csk stores  as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels 
operating income operating income increased million  or  from million of sales in to million of sales in the increase in operating income is the result of increased sales and gross profit  offset by the increased sg a discussed above as well as a million charge related to the legacy doj investigation of csk as discussed in item  legal proceedings and note legal matters to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sg a costs from strong comparable store sales 
this full year operating income as a percentage of sales represents a record high for the company  and we would anticipate these operating levels to be sustainable 
other income and expense interest expense decreased million  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in the decrease in interest expense during as compared to is the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our secured asset backed credit facility credit facility 
included as a component of other income for the year ended december   is a nonrecurring  non operating gain of million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk 
income taxes our provision for income taxes increased million from million effective tax rate in to million effective tax rate in the increase in our provision for income taxes is due to the increase in our taxable income 
the increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of the charge related to the csk doj investigation of million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
net income as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income increased million  or  from million of sales in to million of sales in earnings per share our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares compared to for the year ended december   on million shares 
adjustments for nonrecurring and non operating events our year to date results include a nonrecurring charge related to the ongoing  legacy doj investigation of csk as well as a nonrecurring  non operating gain in other income related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from csk 
adjusted operating income  excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk  increased to million of sales for the year ended december   from million of sales for the same period in adjusted net income  excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased to million of sales for the year ended december   from million of sales for the same period in adjusted diluted earnings per common share  excluding the impact of the charge related to the doj investigation of csk and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable  increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period in

these items include adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the csk doj investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the csk note receivable provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations 
we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
the material limitation of these non gaap measures is that such measures are not reflective of actual gaap amounts 
we compensate for this limitation by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
compared to sales sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in comparable store sales stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales sales of stores opened throughout non store sales including machinery  sales to independent part stores and team members sales in for stores that have merged or closed acquired csk store sales  excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales sales after  the one year anniversary of the acquisition total increase in sales comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores  sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain csk branded stores were closed for conversion 
comparable store sales for stores operating on the o reilly systems increased for the year ended december  the o reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a increase for the core o reilly and post conversion schuck s stores  a increase from the converted checker stores and a decrease in comparable 
table of contents stores sales from the converted murray s stores 
comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy csk system increased for the year ended december  consolidated comparable store sales increased for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  we believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers 
the improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in transaction counts  while average ticket remained flat with the prior year 
the flat average ticket value was attributable to more complex and costly repair parts  consistent with ongoing industry trends offset by competitive price reductions in the acquired csk stores and the addition of a wider assortment of entry level products in those stores 
store growth we opened new o reilly branded stores and one new schuck s store in at december   we operated  stores compared to  stores at december  due to the acquisition and integration of csk  we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to new stores in  excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of csk  however  we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired csk stores in versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired csk stores in  the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost  changes in our product mix  distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products 
product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of csk 
we anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired csk stores throughout the year 
we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution 
additionally  gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to diy customers 
prior to the acquisition of csk  our mix of sales to diy customers was approximately equal to sales to professional service provider customers 
at the time of the acquisition in july of  acquired csk stores generated more than of their total sales from diy customers 
the addition of the acquired csk stores predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately diy and professional service provider 
in  core o reilly stores derived approximately of our sales from our diy customers and approximately from our professional service provider customers  while acquired csk stores derived approximately of sales from our diy customers and approximately from our professional service provider customers 
sales to diy customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional service providers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional service providers 
in addition  we have added our private label product lines to the acquired csk stores inventory mix 
private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products 
improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 
the reductions in commodity prices  without corresponding decreases in retail pricing  that we experienced in returned to more normal levels by the end of and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in additionally  in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers dc in our western markets  we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new dc team members become proficient with the o reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the dollar increase in sg a expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of csk and new stores 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired csk stores  which have a higher expense structure than the core o reilly store base  and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product line changeovers for acquired csk stores 
these increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the csk headquarters operations in phoenix  arizona to our facilities in springfield  missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales 
operating income operating income in increased million  or  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in  representing an increase of 

table of contents interest expense interest expense increased million  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in the increase in interest expense is the result of a full year of borrowings under our credit facility in that was used to fund the acquisition of csk in  the opening of new stores  ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of csk  the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in on the non swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes 
other income expense for the year ended december   included one time charges of million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 
income taxes our provision for income taxes increased from million in effective tax rate to million in effective tax rate 
the decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one time charge to adjust tax liabilities in relating to the csk acquisition  offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where csk stores are located 
the increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes 
net income as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income increased million  or  from million in of sales to million in of sales 
earnings per share our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares compared to for the year ended december   on million shares 
adjustments for nonrecurring and non operating events our year ended december   included one time and non cash charges related to the july   acquisition of csk 
these charges included one time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt  commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility  a one time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of csk  a one time charge to conform the csk team member vacation policy with the o reilly policy and a non cash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk s trade names and trademarks  which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of csk store locations 
our year ended december   results included a non cash charge to amortize the value assigned to csk s trade names and trademarks 
adjusted diluted earnings per share  excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges  increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period one year ago

we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the company s ongoing core operations 
management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this 
table of contents non gaap information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business 
material limitations of this non gaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts and amortization of acquisition related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures

total debt decreased and total equity increased from to the decrease in total debt was driven by strong cash flow from operations which allowed us to substantially pay down the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the increase in total equity was due to increased retained earnings resulting from strong net income in and an increase in additional paid in capital  primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits as well as the impact of share based compensation 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization charges  gain loss on property and equipment  deferred income taxes and stock based compensation charges  a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory  net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors 
the decrease in net inventory investment in as compared to is the result of the significant investments in to improve the 
table of contents inventory availability in the acquired csk stores 
although our investment in net inventory decreased year over year in  duplicative and excess inventory levels throughout our distribution network have lead to an increase in per store average inventory 
the average per store inventory for our stores increased to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in other liabilities is principally due to the accrual of the csk doj investigation charge during which is expected to be paid in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in as discussed above  which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
the average per store inventory for our stores increased to million as of december   from million as of december  as we made significant investments in the acquired csk stores in to improve the inventory availability 
during  we will continue to refine the inventory levels in the acquired csk stores and will focus on returning excess quantities to vendors where appropriate and selling through the remainder of the excess quantities on hand in the stores 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of csk and an increase in payments received on notes receivable 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in capital expenditures related to the acquisition of csk include the purchase of properties for dcs and costs associated with the conversion of csk stores to the o reilly brand 
although we opened four new dcs in  a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these dcs occurred in as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities 
the increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one time nonrecurring payment received to settle the note receivable acquired from csk 
increases in cash used in investing activities in both and were primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the conversions of acquired csk stores to the o reilly brand and the properties and facilities for the additional dcs 
we opened net new stores in and net new stores in both and we plan to open net new stores in the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition  improvements  fixtures  net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately million to million  however  such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store site 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in net cash used in financing activities in compared to net cash provided by financing activities in is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long term debt 
the repayments in were funded by increased cash provided by operating activities as well as decreased capital expenditures compared to the same period in the increase in cash provided by financing activities in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans and the associated tax benefit from the exercises 
sources of liquidity our long term business strategy requires capital to open new stores  to complete the conversions of the acquired csk stores  expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores 
the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolver 
decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
additionally  decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and  therefore  negatively impact the funds available under our revolver 
we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolver will be sufficient to fund both our short term and long term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 
credit facilities on july   in connection with the acquisition of csk  we entered into a credit agreement for a five year billion secured credit facility arranged by ba the credit facility  which we used to refinance debt  fund the cash portion of the acquisition  pay for other transaction related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward 
this credit facility replaced a previous unsecured  five year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the credit facility was comprised of a billion tranche a revolving credit facility and a million first in last out revolving credit facility filo tranche 
on the date of the transaction  the amount of the borrowing base available  as described in the credit agreement  under the credit facility was billion of which we borrowed million 
we used borrowings under the credit facility to repay certain existing debt of csk  repay our million a senior notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility 
the terms of the credit facility granted us the right to terminate the filo tranche upon meeting certain requirements  including no events of default and aggregate projected availability under the credit facility 
during the year ended december   we elected to exercise our right to terminate the filo tranche 
as of december  and  the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was billion and billion  respectively  of which we had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively 
the available borrowings under the credit facility were also reduced by stand by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
as of december  and  we had stand by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million and million  respectively  and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under 
table of contents the credit facility was million and million  respectively 
as part of the credit facility  we had pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we were subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant  with which we complied as of december  and at december   borrowings under the tranche a revolver bore interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum  with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds 
the base rate was equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by ba from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 
fees related to unused capacity under the credit facility were assessed at a rate of of the remaining available borrowings under the facility  subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity 
in addition  we paid customary commitment fees  letter of credit fees  underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility 
all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were repaid in conjunction with the issuance of our senior notes on january   as further discussed below 
on january   we entered into a new credit agreement for a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver arranged by ba and barclays  which matures in january of the revolver includes a million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line borrowings 
our ability to draw under the revolving facility is conditioned upon  among other things  our ability to certify that the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement are true  correct and complete in all material respects and that no event of default has occurred or would result from the proposed extension of credit 
borrowings under the revolver other than swing line loans bear interest  at our option  at either the base rate or eurodollar rate both as defined in the agreement plus a margin  that will vary from to in the case of loans bearing interest at the eurodollar rate and to in the case of loans bearing interest at the base rate  in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
swing line loans made under the revolver bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above 
in addition  we will pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments  varying from to based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
the revolver replaced the secured credit facility we entered into on july  exchangeable senior notes on july   we executed the third supplemental indenture the third supplemental indenture to the exchangeable senior notes due the notes  in which we agreed to become a guarantor  on a subordinated basis  of the million principal amount of the notes originally issued by csk pursuant to an indenture dated as of december   as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of december   and the second supplemental indenture  dated as of july   by and between csk auto corporation  csk auto  inc and the bank of new york mellon trust company  na  as trustee 
on december   and effective as of july   we entered into the fourth supplemental indenture in order to correct the definition of exchange rate in the third supplemental indenture 
the notes were exchangeable  under certain circumstances  into cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes bore interest at per year until december   and until maturity on december  prior to their stated maturity  these notes were exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances as more fully described in the indenture under which the notes were issued during any fiscal quarter and only during that fiscal quarter commencing after july   if the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  if the notes had been called for redemption by us  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  such as a change in control 
on july   the notes became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through september   the last trading day of our third quarter  as provided for in the indentures governing the notes 
the notes became exchangeable as our common stock closed at or above of the exchange price as defined in the indentures governing the notes for trading days within the consecutive trading day period ending on june  as a result  during the exchange period commencing july   and continuing through and including september   for each  principal amount of the notes held  holders of the notes could  if they elected  surrender their notes for exchange 
if the notes were exchanged  we would deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and  in the event our total exchange obligation exceeded the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged  shares of our common stock in respect of that excess 
the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each  in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of approximately shares of our common stock and approximately in cash 
on september   certain holders of the notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange million of the principal amount of the notes 
the cash settlement averaging period as defined in the indentures governing the notes ended on october   and on october   we delivered million in cash  which represented the principal amount of the notes exchanged and the value of partial shares  and  shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation 
concurrently  we retired the million principal amount of the exchanged notes 
on october   the notes again became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through december  
table of contents the noteholders had the option to require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december   december   or december   or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture 
we had the option to redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december   upon at least calendar days notice 
on november   we announced our intention to redeem the notes on december   at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to  but not including  the redemption date 
on or prior to december   the remaining holders of the notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange the million remaining principal amount of the notes 
the cash settlement averaging period as defined in the indentures governing the notes ended on december   and on december   we delivered million in cash  which represented the principal amount of the notes exchanged and the value of partial shares  and  shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation 
concurrently  we retired the million principal amount of the exchanged notes 
senior notes due on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes at a price to the public of of their face value in the public market  of which certain of our subsidiaries are the guarantors  and umb is trustee 
the senior notes bear interest at which is payable on january and july of each year  beginning on july  the senior notes mature on january  proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous secured credit facility  to pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes 
prior to october   the senior notes are redeemable  in whole  at any time  or in part  from time to time  at our option upon not less than nor more than days notice at a redemption price  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the redemption date  equal to the greater of of the principal amount thereof  or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the applicable treasury yield as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points 
on or after october   the senior notes are redeemable  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at our option upon not less than nor more than days notice at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the redemption date 
in addition  if we undergo a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes  holders of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to but not including the repurchase date 
debt covenants the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt  ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property  in each case as set forth in the indenture 
these covenants are  however  subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions 
the new revolver contains certain positive and negative debt covenants 
these covenants include limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the revolver  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of times from the closing through december   times through december   and times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of times from the closing through maturity 
our consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and stock option compensation expense ebitdar to adjusted debt 
adjusted debt includes outstanding debt  outstanding standby letters of credit  six times capitalized rent and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long term debt 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

table of contents our adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio was times and times as of december  and  respectively

we do not  and nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the csk doj investigation charge  the gain from the settlement of the note receivable  and the presentation of ebitdar provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations 
we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
material limitations of this non gaap measure are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash 
we do not believe  however  that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 
on december   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated party 
under the terms of the transaction  we sold properties  including land  buildings and improvements  which generated million of cash 
the lease  which is being accounted for as an operating lease  provides for an initial lease term of years and may be extended for one initial ten year period and two additional successive periods of five years each 
the resulting gain of million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term 
net rent expense during the initial term is approximately million annually 
in august  we entered into a sale leaseback with o reilly wooten  llp an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company 
the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately million of cash 
the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss 
the lease  which has been accounted for as an operating lease  calls for an initial term of years with three five year renewal options 
we issued stand by letters of credit provided by a million sub limit under the credit facility that reduced our available borrowings 
those letters of credit were issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit had a one year term from the date of issuance 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding at december  and  respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms 
due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our contractual obligations as of december   included commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements  short and long term debt arrangements  interest payments related to long term debt  fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments  which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in note long term debt and note commitments to the consolidated financial statements

during the years ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of million and million  respectively  as a result of borrowings under our secured credit facility  which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement 
see note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
on january   we entered into a new credit agreement for a five year million revolver  which matures in january of borrowings under the revolver other than swing line loans bear interest  at our option  at either the base rate or eurodollar rate both as defined in the agreement plus a margin  that will vary from to in the case of loans bearing interest at the eurodollar rate and to in the case of loans bearing interest at the base rate  in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
swing line loans made under the revolver bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments  varying from to based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
the revolver replaced the secured credit facility 
on january   we issued million of unsecured senior notes which are due on january  the estimated annual interest payments for the senior notes are expected to be approximately million 
the principal amount and estimated annual interest payments are not included in the above table of contractual obligations as of december  the minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax  insurance and maintenance costs  which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year 
these expenses historically average approximately of the corresponding lease payments 
we use various self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  vehicle and general liability  and employee health care benefits 
these liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities  however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including estimated interest and penalties 
these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets  all of which was included as a component of other liabilities 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management 
management bases its assumptions  estimates  and adjustments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates 
management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

table of contents vendor concessions we receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  allowances for warranties  merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates 
co operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program  specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes  are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
all other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory 
amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns 
management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations 
based on our historical results and current assessment  we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations 
the eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  property loss  and employee health care benefits 
with the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities  which are limited by the design of these plans  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability or property loss claim 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience and trend lines  projected medical and legal inflation  and growth patterns and exposure forecasts 
the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations 
our calculation of self insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities 
actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates  which may result in material losses or gains 
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods  we adjust our self insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information 
these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value 
these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities  but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 
if self insurance reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  accounts receivable we provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors 
actual results have consistently been within management s expectations  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed from our estimated allowance at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors  such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority  experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings 
changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates 
alternatively  we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position 
while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion  our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 
inventory obsolescence and shrink inventory  which consists of automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and tools  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal 
the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population 
we have developed sophisticated systems for 
table of contents monitoring the life cycle of a given product and  accordingly  have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand 
we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost 
this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate  at a given point in time  the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods 
ultimately  our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances 
we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 
we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink 
we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic  full physical inventories at our stores and dcs 
to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage  we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances 
we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates 
if unrecorded shrink changed from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on december  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
we have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs  however  we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of december   nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing 
if the price of o reilly stock  which was a primary input used to determine the company s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing  changed by from the value used during testing  the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 
closed property reserves we maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations 
we accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non cancelable lease payments  contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date  net of estimated sublease income 
the closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms 
we estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
if closed property reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  legal reserves we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o reilly is currently involved 
we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against csk and certain of its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations  litigation and indemnity obligations 
our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of csk 
management  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures 
if legal reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  
table of contents inflation and seasonality for the last three fiscal years  we have been successful  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs  economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying 
to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry wide  we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products 
as a result  we do not believe our operations have been materially  adversely affected by inflation 
to some extent  our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns 
while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year  our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates 
we had potential interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december   however  from time to time  we had entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure 
on july   october   november   and january   we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts the swaps with a total notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on july   for million matured on august   the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on october   for million and was scheduled to mature on october   was terminated at our request on september   the interest rate swap transactions we entered into with bbt  ba and or suntrust on october   totaling million  matured on october   bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to million as of december  the swaps represented contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
if interest rates increased or decreased by basis points  annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately million million after tax  based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities  management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
the interest rate contracts are derivative instruments which have been designated as cash flow hedges 
we do not hold or issue derivative financials instruments for trading purposes 
all of the interest rate swap transactions that existed as of december   for a total notional amount of million  were terminated at the company s request on january   concurrent with the closing and issuance of our senior notes
