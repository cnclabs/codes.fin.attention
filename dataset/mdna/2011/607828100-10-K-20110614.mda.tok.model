item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan founded in  modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
we operate on five continents  in countries  and with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems  off highway and industrial equipment and fuel cell applications 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  and egr coolers 
consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche on highway  off highway and industrial end markets 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and selective acquisitions 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse geographic and end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and operational and financial discipline to ensure improved profitability and long term stability 
development of new products and technologies our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new and emerging markets is one of our competitive strengths 
we own two global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the us  and in bonlanden  germany 
our reputation for providing high quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with relatively few product warranty issues 
in fiscal  we spent million representing approximately percent of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses on our product and technology research and development efforts 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers that recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and patent protected 
we have been granted and or acquired more than  patents on our technologies over the life of the company and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 

table of contents strategic planning and corporate development we employ both short term one to three year and longer term five to seven year strategic planning processes  enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets and product areas all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our recent success from this process has been our organic expansion activities into niche hvac and refrigeration markets in our commercial products segment 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
the competitiveness of the global market place requires us to move toward a greater manufacturing scale in order to create a more competitive cost base 
as costs for materials and purchased parts rise from time to time due to global increases in the commodity markets  we seek low cost country sourcing when appropriate and enter into contracts with some of our customers that provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  intended to enable increased profitability and cash flows over the long term with particular emphasis on working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals driving past and current improvement in global cash and debt management and access to sufficient credit 
during fiscal significant progress was made in improving the company s liquidity and financial position 
on august   we entered into a four year  million amended and restated credit agreement  which amended and restated the company s existing revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company issued million of percent series a senior notes maturing on august  the proceeds from the notes were used to repay our existing senior notes 
these actions extended the maturity of our outstanding debt obligations  providing the company a long term source of financing at reduced interest rates 
during fiscal  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock with cash proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and other associated fees 
our executive management incentive compensation cash bonus plan for fiscal was based on operating margin and asset turnover  driving our singular focus on alignment of management interests with shareholders interests in our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees that is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the long term performance of the company 
this plan is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards  which are based on a mix of an annual growth rate in adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and a target return on average capital employed at the end of a three year period fiscal consolidated market conditions and trends during fiscal  the company reported revenues from continuing operations of billion  a percent increase from billion in fiscal the company s end markets are showing strong improvement from the deep recession experienced during and this improvement is seen across most of modine s end markets  including the commercial vehicle  off highway and automotive markets 
the commercial hvac markets are showing early signs of modest improvement  as these markets generally trend with commercial construction build rates  which have not yet recovered from the recent recession 
while the company s business volumes improved in fiscal  the volumes remain approximately percent below pre recessionary annual sales of billion 

table of contents the original equipment manufacturer oem marketplace is extremely competitive and our customers demand that we continue to provide high quality products as well as annual price decreases 
from time to time  we also experience volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  steel  and stainless steel nickel 
the combination of these factors impacts our profitability 
our response to recent market conditions the company has implemented a number of cost and operational efficiency measures designed to improve our longer term competitiveness o manufacturing realignment 
over the last four years  the company has announced and closed three manufacturing facilities in the us pemberville  ohio  logansport  indiana and harrodsburg  kentucky  and one manufacturing facility in europe t bingen  germany 
in addition  the company announced the closure of the camdenton  missouri manufacturing facility which we expect to complete in fiscal we have also implemented a significant reduction of direct costs in our manufacturing facilities and percent reduction of indirect costs in our manufacturing facilities 
as volumes begin to recover  the benefits of these actions can be seen in the company s gross margin  which improved from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal we also have invested in four new plants in low cost countries changzhou  china  nuevo laredo  mexico  gy ngy s  hungary  and chennai  india 
these facilities are engaged in numerous product launches and will continue significant launch activity over the next fiscal year 
o portfolio rationalization 
the company s business structure is organized around three global product lines  engine products  powertrain cooling products and commercial products  which support our reporting segments 
the company evaluated product lines within and across its segments to assess them relative to modine s competitive position and the overall business attractiveness in order to identify those product lines that should be divested or exited 
the company has implemented an action plan to deemphasize its automotive module business  which most significantly impacts our original equipment europe segment 
we anticipate that certain legacy automotive module programs will be winding down over the next several fiscal years 
this will significantly change the revenue mix in our original equipment europe segment 
in addition  during fiscal the company significantly decreased its exposure to the vehicular heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac business with the sale of its south korean wholly owned subsidiary 
o capital allocation 
our business is capital intensive  requiring a significant amount of investment in the new technologies and products that the company supports 
we employ an enhanced capital allocation discipline designed to allocate capital spending to the segments and programs that will provide the highest return on our investment 
all business units are measured using specific performance standards and they must earn the right to obtain capital to fund growth through their performance 
o sg a cost containment 
the company is committed to controlling its overall sg a  and continues to focus on streamlining key business processes in order to assist with this effort 
we plan to invest in growth where it is deemed to be necessary  particularly with the original equipment asia segment and the commercial products segment 
sg a as a percentage of sales has declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal we remain focused on a long term target of to percent for sg a as a percentage of sales 
in addition to the actions described above  the company also focuses on mitigating material price changes for our products 
when possible  the company enters into material pass through arrangements with its key customers where material price changes are subject to pass through to these customers on a lag basis 
this lag period can extend up to a year  based on the agreements we have with individual customers 
from time to time we enter into futures contracts related to forecasted purchases of commodities  largely aluminum and copper  to mitigate price changes during the lag period before we can pass through the material price changes 
we also mitigate growing cost pressures by accelerating new product development and expanding into new and existing niche markets 
we continue to focus on developing new and expanded proprietary technology that is of more value in the marketplace such as egr coolers and our origami radiators and condensers in order to secure favorable price terms 

table of contents segment information strategy  market conditions and trends each of our business segments is managed at the vice president level with separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used to evaluate the performance of each business segment  and make decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate sg a expenses 
original equipment europe percent of fiscal revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems as well as vehicular climate control components to various end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  egr products  retarder and transmission cooling components  and hvac condensers 
fiscal sales have increased primarily in the premium automotive and commercial vehicle markets 
gross margin improved during fiscal due to improved operating leverage on higher sales volumes as a result of several measures management previously enacted to reduce operating costs and improve cash generation 
we continue our focus on various lean manufacturing initiatives  low cost country sourcing and the adjustment of our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations  when appropriate 
production volumes are increasing in our new gy ngy s  hungary facility 
we expect our european business to benefit from our various technology initiatives  which allow us to distinguish ourselves from competitors in the eyes of our customers 
we also expect this segment to continue to gain market share in the commercial vehicle segment as we focus on this strategically important market and de emphasize our focus on automotive modules 
this business is negatively impacted by rising material prices  at least until these rising prices are offset by material pass through agreements on a time lag 
we also expect to continue to see price reduction demands from our customers along with continuous and ongoing increased customer service expectations and competition from low cost country competitors 
at the same time  the business has performed well through the global economic recession  is strongly positioned with a solid customer reputation for technology  service and project management  and has been successful in winning additional program awards  particularly in the commercial vehicle market  that are scheduled to begin production in the time frame 
original equipment north america percent of fiscal revenues our original equipment north america segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made for the on highway markets  commercial vehicle oems and automotive components  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor homes  motor coaches and light trucks 
it also serves the off highway markets including agricultural  construction and industrial products eg lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
the sales volume recovery in  specifically in the commercial vehicle  agriculture and construction markets  resulted in strong revenue and operational results 
the manufacturing footprint realignment and fixed cost reduction efforts from the last few years provided significant operating leverage as the volumes recovered 
the north american business will continue to focus on growing in the markets where its products and manufacturing footprint create a competitive advantage 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes the following first  our strategy of repositioning the segment  including reassessing our manufacturing footprint  improving sourcing of raw materials and purchased parts  and other programs intended to increase efficiency and right size capacity has put us in a cost competitive and flexible position 
going forward  we will continue to assess and adjust as necessary in order to maintain and improve our position and value to our customers 

table of contents second  we are focused on reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth  while at the same time rationalizing the existing product lines to meet required financial metrics or fit within our overall strategy 
third  we are focused on pursuing only selected new business opportunities that meet our minimum targeted rates of return  thus enabling profitable growth to the company 
commercial products percent of fiscal revenues our commercial products business manufactures and distributes a variety of hvac products  primarily for commercial building and related applications in north america  europe  asia and south africa 
we sell our heating and cooling products through various channels to consulting contractors  engineers  and building owners for applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
our heating products include gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  low intensity infrared  and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products include single packaged vertical units and unit ventilators used in school room applications  computer room air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers  ceiling cassettes  and roof top packaged ventilation units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
we also manufacture coils copper tube aluminum fin coils  stainless steel tube aluminum fin coils and all aluminum microchannel coils for heating  refrigeration  air conditioning and vehicular applications 
these are sold to original equipment manufacturers and used in residential eg  high efficiency furnaces  commercial eg  chillers  ice machines  dehumidifiers and vehicular products eg  air conditioning 
revenues improved slightly from the prior year due to modest market demand recovery from the global recession and increased market share in certain segments 
gross margins remained relatively flat from prior year as a percentage of sales despite significant commodity material cost increases 
we offset these cost increases with price increases and through improved manufacturing productivity 
economic conditions  such as demand for new commercial construction  growth in data centers  and school renovations  as well as higher efficiency demands are growth drivers for the heating and cooling products 
south america percent of fiscal revenues our south america segment provides heat exchange products to a variety of markets in the domestic brazilian market as well as for export to north america and europe 
this business provides products to the on highway commercial vehicle markets  off highway markets  including construction and agricultural applications  automotive oems and industrial applications  primarily for power generation systems 
this business also provides products to the brazilian  north american and european aftermarkets for both automotive and commercial applications 
we manufacture radiators  charge air coolers  oil coolers  auxiliary coolers transmission  hydraulic  and power steering  engine cooling modules and hvac system modules 
growth drivers in this region include the development of additional agricultural land and infrastructure improvements in brazil 
original equipment asia percent of fiscal revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain cooling systems and engine products to customers in commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
modine technology  performance  quality and reputation have enabled us to win new engine products business 
emissions standards in china and india lag behind europe and north america 
as a result  some local on and off highway powertrain cooling customers focus on price versus technology 
however  we are seeing a shift towards more higher performing  durable products  which may provide us additional powertrain cooling opportunities in the future 
many components that we supply in this region become part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy in this business segment is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and continue to focus on building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region in a cost competitive manner 
our new manufacturing facility in chennai  india is currently producing low volumes of products and our manufacturing facility in changzhou  china is continuing to ramp up production 
we are scheduled to begin production of several new products from both of these facilities during the next fiscal year 

table of contents outlook our net sales improved sequentially throughout fiscal as our markets continue to recover from the recession experienced in and our expectations for fiscal include a to percent increase in net sales compared with our fiscal results 
specifically  we expect continued recovery in the commercial vehicle markets in north america and slight improvement in agriculture and construction markets  growth in the off highway markets in asia as we launch new programs  improvement in the commercial vehicle and off highway markets in europe  modest improvements in our commercial products markets and improvements in commercial vehicles and construction in south america 
we expect that the positive impact of the sales volume improvements on our results from operations will result in operating income in a range of to percent of sales 
further  we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to and capital spending in the range of to million 
this outlook represents a significant improvement in diluted earnings per share over the reported in fiscal consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal sales volumes and profitability improved significantly as our end markets have shown strong recovery from the recent economic recession 
fiscal sales volumes declined significantly as a result of the weakened global economy 
the instability in the global financial and economic markets created a significant downturn in the vehicular markets in which the company competes 
in fiscal  the company recorded significant goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges  along with restructuring charges primarily related to workforce reductions 
the fiscal and fiscal results have been revised to reflect the correction of errors relating to these periods

table of contents gross profit increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the improved sales volumes and improved gross margin when compared with fiscal gross margin improved from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the gross margin improvement is primarily attributable to better fixed cost absorption on the improved sales volumes  offset partially by higher commodity metals prices 
sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased basis points as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
the overall increase in sg a expenses is a reflection of our reinvestment in the business to support future growth  including higher employee benefits such as salary increases and increased headcount and higher engineering and development costs 
long lived asset impairment charges of million were recorded in fiscal primarily related to a program cancellation in our original equipment europe and original equipment asia segments  assets no longer in use in the original equipment europe segment and on facilities held for sale due to a continued decline in the real estate market for commercial property in the original equipment north america segment 
interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal largely due to million of costs related to the debt refinancing completed during the second quarter of fiscal  including million of prepayment penalties and million of write offs of unamortized financing costs 
these costs significantly exceeded approximately million of costs incurred in fiscal related to the prepayment of debt 
other income of million for fiscal represents a million decline from other income of million in fiscal due to the sale of our percent ownership of anhui jianghaui mando climate control co 
ltd during fiscal fiscal other income consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains on inter company loans denominated in foreign currencies and to a lesser extent interest income and equity in affiliate s earnings 
the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to an million development tax incentive credit related to our operations in hungary which we were able to recognize during the current year with the attainment of a minimum employment requirement 
partially offsetting this tax incentive is a provision for income taxes resulting from continued pre tax earnings growth in certain of our foreign jurisdictions 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales decreased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal driven by sales volume deterioration as a result of the weakened global economy in the second half of fiscal and continuing into fiscal medium heavy duty truck sales were down approximately percent for all markets and agriculture and construction sales volumes were down over percent for all markets

unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum  copper and natural gas impact earnings 
during fiscal  the amount of expense recorded in cost of sales related to the settlement of certain futures contracts was negligible 
during fiscal and  million and million of expense  respectively  was recorded in cost of sales related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
at march   million of unrealized gains remain deferred in other comprehensive loss income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 
the company previously entered into future contracts related to forecasted purchases of copper and nickel which are not designated as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses on these contracts are recorded directly in the consolidated statement of operations 
there was no income or expense recorded in fiscal or fiscal related to future contracts for copper or nickel 
during fiscal  million of expense was recorded in cost of sales related to these future contracts 
in fiscal  the company also entered into zero cost collars to offset the foreign exchange exposure on inter company loans

our products and systems typically are aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management 
the typical demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight  more compact  more efficient and more durable in nature to meet ever increasing customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements 
our company s heritage includes depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that  combined with our global manufacturing presence  standardized processes  and state of the art technical centers and wind tunnels  enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to customers at the best value 
our investment in r d in fiscal was million  or percent of sales  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal this level of investment reflects the company s continued commitment to r d in an ever changing market  balanced with a near term focus on more selective capital investment 
consistent with the streamlining of the company s product portfolio  our current research is focused primarily on company sponsored development in the areas of powertrain cooling  engine products and residential and commercial hvac products 
recent r d projects have included development of waste heat recovery systems for major us based engine and truck manufacturers in conjunction with the us department of energy to help these manufacturers meet ever increasing demands for emissions reduction  while simultaneously improving powertrain efficiency and  thus  fuel economy  next generation aluminum radiators for the commercial vehicle  agricultural and constructions markets  and egr technology  which enables our customers to efficiently meet tighter regulatory emissions standards 
through our proactive r d  we are developing new technologies designed to keep our customers within federal and international guidelines and regulations well into the future 
we continue to identify  evaluate and engage in external research projects that complement strategic internal research initiatives  some of which are government sponsored  in order to further leverage the company s significant thermal technology expertise and capability 
modine has been granted more than  worldwide patents over the life of the company 
modine is focused on the long term commercialization of our intellectual property and research  and believes that these investments will result in new and next generation products and technologies 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
in certain situations  the price increases are recognized as revenue at the time products are shipped in accordance with the contractual arrangements with our customers  but are offset by appropriate provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected 
these provisions are established based on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
there was no provision for estimated commodity price increases at march  and impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets with finite lives and equity investments  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  or the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
fair market value is estimated in various ways depending on the nature of the assets under review 
this value can be based on appraised value  estimated salvage value  sales price under negotiation or estimated cancellation charges  as applicable 
the company recorded long lived asset and equity investment impairment charges of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the most significant long lived assets that have been subject to impairment evaluations are the company s net property  plant and equipment  which totaled million at march  within property  plant and equipment  the most significant assets evaluated are buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment 
the company evaluates impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which is generally at the manufacturing plant level 
the company monitors its manufacturing plant performance to determine whether indicators exist that would require an impairment evaluation for the facility 
this includes significant adverse changes in plant profitability metrics  substantial changes in the mix of customer programs manufactured in the plant  consisting of new program launches  reductions  and phase outs  and shifting of programs to other facilities under the company s manufacturing realignment strategy 
when such indicators are present  the company performs an impairment evaluation by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated in the manufacturing facility to the net book value of the long lived assets within that facility 
the undiscounted cash flows are estimated based on the expected future cash flows to be generated by the manufacturing facility over the remaining useful life of the machinery and equipment within that facility 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the long lived assets  such assets are written down to fair market value  which is generally estimated based on appraisals or estimated salvage value 
the majority of the long lived asset impairment charges during fiscal  and have been recorded within the company s original equipment europe and original equipment north america segments 
these segments have experienced the most significant adverse impact of sales volume declines and changing mix of programs within the manufacturing facilities 
in addition  these segments had program phase outs and cancellations  many of which were in the automotive markets 
further unanticipated adverse changes in these segments could result in the need to perform additional impairment evaluations in the future 
the company s cost and operational efficiency measures are designed to attain a more competitive cost base and improve the company s longer term competitiveness reduces the risk of potential long lived asset impairment charges in the future 
the manufacturing realignment strategy of this plan was designed to improve the utilization of the company s facilities  with fewer facilities  but operating at higher capacities 
the portfolio rationalization strategy of this plan was designed to identify products where the company can earn a sufficient return on its investment  and divest or exit products that do not meet required metrics 
recent portfolio rationalization actions include de emphasis on automotive module business  primarily within europe 
these strategies create better facility utilization and greater profitability in product mix  which allow the manufacturing facilities to withstand more significant adverse changes before an impairment charge is necessary 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other conditions exist that would require a more frequent evaluation 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
in fiscal  the annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment was conducted in the third quarter resulting in no impairment charge 
subsequently  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test to the fourth quarter to better align with its annual and long term planning process 
as a result  the company performed the impairment test as of march   which resulted in no impairment charge 
the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives relates 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
to the extent that book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment is recognized 
during fiscal it was determined that the original equipment europe segment goodwill was fully impaired  necessitating a charge of million at march  the company had goodwill of million recorded which was primarily comprised of million within the south america segment and million within the commercial products segment 
the south america and commercial products segments reported operating income of million and million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal  respectively 
the future discounted cash flows of these segments continue to substantially exceed their carrying value indicating that the goodwill recorded in these segments is fully realizable at march  if  in future periods  these segments experience a significant unanticipated economic downturn in the markets in which they operate  this would require an impairment review 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 
tooling costs pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over the program life and are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
no significant arrangements existed during the years ended march  and where customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 
assets held for sale assets or businesses are considered to be held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market the assets or business for sale at a price reasonable in relation to its fair value  the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition  the sale of the asset or business is probable and expected to be completed within one year and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan 
upon designation as held for sale  the carrying value of the assets of the business are recorded at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
the company ceases to record depreciation expense at the time of designation as held for sale 
certain facilities which the company has closed or intends to close and are currently marketing for sale were classified as held for sale at march  and 
table of contents pensions and postretirement benefits plans the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in healthcare costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing domestic defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  the modine manufacturing company pension plan for non hourly factory and salaried employees was modified so that no service performed for salaried employees after march  would be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula and no increases in annual earnings for salaried employees after december  would be included in calculating the average annual portion under the pension plan formula 
the plan was further modified so that no increases in annual earnings and no service performed for non union hourly factory employees after december  will be included in calculating the average annual earnings and years of credit service under the pension plan formula 
we believe the current defined contribution plan for domestic employees will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses covered by the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and fiscal was percent and percent  respectively 
for fiscal  the company has assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of march for fiscal  the company used a discount rate of percent  reflecting a slight decrease from percent in fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the healthcare cost trend rate 
the healthcare trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company expects this to be percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree healthcare and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
furthermore  effective january   the plan was modified to eliminate coverage for retired participants that are medicare eligible 
a one percent increase in the healthcare trend rate would result in no substantial increase in postretirement expense and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately million 
other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  trade compliance  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated

in part i 
in this report 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following operational risks the efficient deployment of resources to meet increasing demand for the company s products  the impact of operational inefficiencies as a result of program launches and product transfers  modine s ability to maintain current programs and compete effectively for new business  including its ability to offset or otherwise address increasing pricing pressures from its competitors and price reduction pressures from its customers  costs and other effects of the remediation of environmental contamination  modine s ability to obtain profitable business at its facilities in the low cost countries of china  hungary  mexico and india and to meet quality standards with products produced at these facilities  unanticipated problems with suppliers meeting modine s time  quality and price demands  modine s ability to successfully implement restructuring plans and drive cost reductions and increased gross margins as a result  unanticipated delays or modifications initiated by major customers with respect to product applications or requirements  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  including unanticipated launch challenges and warranty claims  work stoppages or interference at modine s facilities or those of its major customers and or suppliers  the possibility that other or more significant issues may be identified in connection with reviews by government agencies related to trade compliance matters at the company s laredo  texas warehouse and nuevo laredo mexico facility  and costs and other effects of unanticipated litigation or claims  and the increasing pressures associated with rising healthcare and insurance costs 
market risks economic  social and political conditions  changes and challenges in the markets where modine operates and competes including currency exchange rate fluctuations particularly the value of the euro relative to the us dollar  tariffs  inflation  changes in interest rates  recession  and restrictions associated with importing and exporting and foreign ownership  the impact on modine of increases in commodity prices  particularly modine s exposure to the changing prices of aluminum  copper  steel and stainless steel nickel  modine s ability or inability to pass increasing commodity prices on to customers as well as the inherent lag in timing of such pass through pricing  and 
table of contents the impact of environmental laws and regulations on modine s business and the business of modine s customers  including modine s ability to take advantage of opportunities to supply alternative new technologies to meet environmental emissions standards 
financial risks modine s ability to fund its liquidity requirements and meet its long term commitments in the event of any renewed disruption in the credit markets  and modine s ability to realize future tax benefits 
in addition to the risks set forth above  modine is subject to other risks and uncertainties identified by the company in public filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
modine does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  economic risk and commodity price risk 
foreign currency risk modine is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign countries 
modine has manufacturing facilities in brazil  china  mexico  south africa  india and throughout europe 
it also has an equity investment in a japanese company 
modine sells and distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures  distributes and sells its products 
the company attempts to mitigate foreign currency risks on transactions with customers and suppliers in foreign countries by entering into contracts that are denominated in the functional currency of the modine entity engaging in the contract 
the company operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  and changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the company foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of shareholders equity 
weakening of the us dollar to other foreign currencies during fiscal  especially the euro and real  has led to improvement of the company s foreign results 
this improvement is evident in the company s favorable currency translation adjustments of million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  the company also experienced a general weakening of the us dollar to these foreign currencies  which resulted in a favorable currency translation adjustment of million 
as of march  and  the company foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely all move in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has  from time to time  certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations and long term inter company loans that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates
