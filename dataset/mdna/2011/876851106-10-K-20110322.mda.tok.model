item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago  and we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of products and services primarily to closely held commercial businesses and their owner operators in the chicago area 
we also provide asset based lending and residential mortgage origination services through offices both in chicago and in other geographic markets 
at december   we had assets of approximately billion  deposits of approximately billion and stockholders equity of million 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and december  and the results of operations for the years ended december   december   and december  this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our policies for the allowance for loan losses  the realizability of deferred tax assets  derivatives used in hedging and the valuation of financial instruments such as investment securities and derivatives to be critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that we consider sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including historical charge off experience  changes in the size of our loan 
table of contents portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss on loans to those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the current illiquidity in the chicago area real estate market has increased the uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may materially vary from our current estimates 
our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have the potential for higher losses for each loan 
these larger loans can cause greater volatility in our reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate for any one loan may have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans can cause an increase in uncollectible loans and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  our allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
income taxes we maintained net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences between book and taxable income  the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes  only net charge offs are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
under gaap  a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future taxable income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of our deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence  if any  of taxes paid in available carry back years and the likelihood that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include a cumulative loss in the current year and prior two years and negative general business and economic trends 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this determination was based  largely  on the negative evidence of a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused primarily by the loan loss provisions made during those periods 
in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions has increased the likelihood of fluctuations in our future earnings 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and corridor agreements  as well as interest rate lock and forward loan sale commitments to either accommodate individual customer needs or to assist in our interest rate risk management 
all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the 
table of contents effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change in fair value 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of a formally designated hedge and quarterly thereafter  an assessment is made to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that derivatives are not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivatives flow through the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of certain of our derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps and corridors  are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate market based valuations 
the valuations are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flow of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
in addition  the fair value estimate also incorporates a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the risk of nonperformance by both us and our counterparties in the fair value measurement 
the resulting fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and  therefore  can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the derivative contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our earnings 
valuation of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities portfolio is determined in accordance with gaap  which requires that we classify financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy 
the determination of fair value is highly subjective and requires management to rely on estimates  assumptions  and judgments that can affect amounts reported in our financial statements 
we obtain the fair value of investment securities from an independent pricing service 
we review the pricing methodology for each significant class of assets used by this third party pricing service to assess the compliance with accounting standards for fair value measurement and classification in the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes  market spreads  cash flows  the us treasury yield curve  live trading levels  trade execution data  market consensus prepayment speeds  credit information  including credit spreads and current rating from credit rating agencies  and the bond s terms and conditions  among other things 
while we use an independent pricing service to obtain the fair values of our investment portfolio  we do employ certain control procedures to determine the reasonableness of the valuations 
we validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values by comparing information obtained from our independent pricing service to other third party valuation sources for selected assets and review the valuations and any differences in valuations with members of management who have the relevant technical expertise to assess the results 
however  we do not alter the fair values provided by our independent pricing service 
each quarter we review our investment securities portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable 
our analysis includes an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings and a cash flow analysis  considering 
table of contents default rates  loss severities based upon the location of the collateral  and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we use other independent pricing sources to obtain fair value estimates and perform discounted cash flow analysis for selected securities 
when the discounted cash flow analysis obtained from those independent pricing sources indicates that we expect all future principal and interest payments will be received in accordance with their original contractual terms  we do not intend to sell the security  and we more likely than not will not be required to sell the security before recovery  the unrealized loss is deemed temporary 
if such analysis shows that we do not expect to be able to recover our entire investment  then an other than temporary impairment charge will be recorded in current earnings for the amount of the credit loss component 
the amount of impairment that related to factors other than the credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income 
our assessments of creditworthiness and the resultant expected cash flows are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only the specific security and its underlying collateral but also the severity of the current overall economic downturn 
our cash flow estimates for mortgage related securities are based on estimates of mortgage default rates  severity of loss  and prepayments  which are difficult to predict 
changes in assumptions can result in material changes in expected cash flows 
therefore  unrealized losses that we have determined to be temporary may at a later date be determined to be other than temporary and have a material impact on our statement of operations 
outlook since  we have pursued a two pronged strategy of asset quality remediation and earnings growth and diversification  which we call our fix and grow strategy 
the fix component refers to our continuing efforts to improve asset quality issues largely caused by the downturn in the chicago area economy  and the resulting impact on real estate prices and liquidity 
the grow component of our strategy seeks to increase and diversify our pre tax  pre provision earnings by repositioning our commercial banking business to provide middle market lending across a wide array of industries 
in addition  grow also encompasses our two new businesses lines cole taylor business capital  our asset based lending arm  and cole taylor mortgage  our mortgage origination business 
we plan to continue pursuing our fix and grow strategy in regarding our fix strategy  we expect to continue to remediate asset quality and to reduce lending concentrations in areas of higher risk 
improvement in asset quality will in part depend on a sustained improvement in the economy and in particular the chicago area real estate market and may continue for some time 
we also expect to maintain focus on the growth component of our strategy emphasizing our commercial banking and mortgage origination businesses 
cole taylor business capital and cole taylor mortgage are relatively new businesses and we believe that each have meaningful potential for continued growth 
cole taylor mortgage s geographic expansion and growth  however  will be limited until the dodd frank mandates surrounding mortgage origination sales incentives are fully understood and implemented 
see supervision and regulation changes to mortgage loan originator compensation for additional details 
we will also look for additional opportunities for strategic  measured expansion provided it increases stockholder value  especially in the areas of deposit franchise enhancement 
results of operations we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share outstanding for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the higher net loss applicable to common stockholders in was due to a million increase in the provision for loan losses  an implied non cash dividend of million representing an inducement to the holders of our non cumulative convertible perpetual series a preferred to convert their series a preferred shares into common stock  higher noninterest expense of million  which was offset by higher net interest income of million and higher noninterest income of million

this provided additional liquidity for us to continue to act as a source of strength for the bank  to better align our capital position to our peers and to support our future growth plans 
in  we also completed an exchange offer in which we issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred 
the series a preferred had an aggregate liquidation preference of million and a non cumulative preferred dividend that accrued at per annum 
by its terms  the series a preferred was convertible into million shares of common stock 
as an inducement to convert  holders of our series a preferred were offered  in the aggregate  an additional million shares of common stock 
in the first quarter of  we announced the sale of million of a new series of preferred stock in a private placement to existing investors 
subject to stockholder approval  which we expect to receive at a special meeting on march   these shares of preferred stock will convert automatically into million shares of common stock  or in the case of certain investors  non voting common stock equivalents 
we intend to use the proceeds to provide additional capital to the bank 
as we continue to grow our business as well as manage our loan portfolio  we may require additional capital  either from earnings retention or external sources 
we continue to review and evaluate our capital plan in conjunction with our business strategy as well as the heightened focus on capital requirements by regulatory authorities and the investment community 
the timing  amount and form of any such capital raise will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of earnings generated by the bank  the opportunities for future growth  further loan losses  regulatory requirements and the state of the capital markets 
highlights we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share outstanding for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  during the lower net loss applicable to common stockholders in was due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and increases in net interest income of million and noninterest income of million 
these decreases to the net loss in were partly offset by a million increase in income tax expense and a million increase in noninterest expense 
in addition  preferred stock dividends and discounts decreased to million during from million during the decrease was primarily due to a million charge in for an implied non cash dividend to the holders of our non cumulative convertible perpetual series a preferred stock to

this decrease was partly offset by higher dividends and discounts as had the full year s impact of the preferred stock issued in september and november noninterest income  without considering the gains and losses from the investment securities portfolio  also increased in as compared to  as an increase in service charge revenue and other income were partly offset by lower trust and investment management fees and losses from our mortgage banking activities 
total noninterest expense increased by million  or  during as compared to this increase included million of higher assessments from the fdic and an increase of million in expenses related to our nonperforming assets 
without the increases in deposit insurance premiums and nonperforming asset expense  our overall noninterest expense would have declined by over million 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income and fees generated by interest earning assets and total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or incurred on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  that was driven largely by a basis point increase in net interest margin 
net interest margin increased to in  compared to in  as our funding costs continued to decrease by more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
the low interest rate environment enabled our portfolio of term deposits to continue to reprice to the current market rates coupled with increasing noninterest bearing deposit balances from customers  and taking advantage of low cost short term funding opportunities drove funding costs lower 
in contrast  the interest earning asset yield declined to in from in the yield earned on loans increased slightly to during from in however  this was more than offset by a drop in the yield on our investment securities portfolio  which decreased to in from in our average interest earning assets during were billion  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during the decrease was driven by lower loan balances largely offset by higher investment portfolio balances 
average loan balances fell due to the continued downward pressure from the current economic environment 
average interest bearing deposit balances decreased to billion in  compared to billion during the decrease was offset by increases in average noninterest bearing deposit balances  which increased million to million during  as compared to million in  and by short term borrowings  which increased million from million during to million during with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income for was million  compared to million for this non gaap presentation is discussed below

during  net interest income benefited from both a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the net interest margin 
our net interest margin increased to in as compared to in the net interest margin increased in as our funding costs decreased by more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
market interest rates declined during and remained at historically low levels throughout since approximately of the loan portfolio is tied to floating or variable indexes  the declining market rates had an immediate impact on our earning asset yields in  which continued in as higher rate assets were repaid and replaced at lower current market rates 
because of our portfolio of term deposits  our cost of funds can lag changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin increased in  as the low interest rate environment enabled our portfolio of term deposits to continue to reprice to the current market rates 
in addition  our cost of funds decreased in as we improved our funding mix by reducing reliance on more costly out of market funding  increased noninterest bearing deposit balances from customers  and took advantage of low cost short term funding opportunities from the fhlb and the frb s term auction facility 
during  the interest earning asset yield declined to from during  a decrease of basis points 
the yield earned on loans decreased to during from in  while the yield on our investment securities portfolio decreased to in from in we took additional steps during to increase net interest income and maintain our earning asset yields by improving loan pricing  including the use of interest rate floors  and increasing the size and duration of our investment portfolio to take advantage of higher yields 
over the same time period  the cost of funds decreased basis points  from during to during the cost of our deposits decreased basis points to during from during in addition  overall borrowing costs benefited from our increased use of attractively priced short term borrowings 
our average interest earning assets during were billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during both an increase in average loans and investment balances produced the overall increase in interest earning assets 
the growth strategy implemented in caused the million  or  increase in average loan balances between the two annual periods 
average loan balances were billion during  compared to billion during we also increased the size of the investment portfolio in an effort to increase average earning assets and enhance net interest margin 
average investment balances increased to billion during from million during  an increase of million or 
the increase in average earning assets was largely funded with short term borrowings and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances remained relatively unchanged at billion during  compared to billion during our average noninterest bearing deposit balances increased million  or  to million during  as compared to million in in addition  average notes payable and other advances increased million and other borrowings increased by million during  as compared to tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial 
table of contents measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  we adjusted the interest earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments

our provision for loan losses totaled million during  an increase of million  or  as compared to the million provision for loan losses recorded in the provision for loan losses in reflects the continued weakness in the chicago area real estate market  deterioration in our bank and bank holding company loans  the rise in nonperforming and impaired loans  and the increase in the severity of the estimated losses associated with these loans 
nonperforming loans and impaired loans remain at elevated levels  increasing slightly in nonperforming loans totaled million at december   compared to million at year end  an increase of million  or 
as we address our problem assets  the level of gross charge offs has increased to million during as compared to million in however  because the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs in  the total allowance for loan losses increased from million at december  to million at december  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses for further discussion of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses

lower nonperforming loans  impaired loans  and net charge offs caused us to decrease our allowance for loan losses in noninterest income the following table presents the composition of our noninterest income for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands service charges trust and investment management fees mortgage origination revenue losses relating to bulk purchased mortgage loans gain loss on sales of investment securities other derivative income letter of credit and other loan fees change in market value of employee deferred compensation plan other noninterest income total noninterest income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest income during totaled million  up from million during  an increase of million or 
increases in the gains on the sale of investment securities in of million  mortgage origination revenue of million from cole taylor mortgage and letters of credit fees of million drove the increase 
in  we recorded gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities of million from the sale of approximately million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year 
see investment securities below for a further discussion we principally derive service charges from deposit accounts 
service charges stayed flat in at million 
service charge income is affected by a number of factors  such as the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
other derivative income totaled million in  compared to million in the increase was almost entirely due to an increase in the number and the size of fees collected on customer related swaps 
see derivative financial instruments following for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
standby letters of credit and other loan fees totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in fees during was primarily due to our expanded asset based lending operations 

table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  noninterest income during totaled million  up from million during the gain on the sale of investment securities in of million and a million loss due to other than temporary impairment of an investment security in accounted for most of this increase 
higher service charges and letter of credit and other fees  partly offset by a decrease in trust and investment management fees and losses from mortgage banking activities  also contributed to this increase 
service charges increased million  or  in to million as compared to million in the increase in service charge revenue in was largely due to increased customer accounts and activity that resulted from the commercial banking growth initiative that we began in in addition  a decrease in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances also contributed to the higher service charge revenue 
trust and investment management fees declined to million during from million during  a decrease of million or 
trust fees totaled  during  compared to million during trust fees were earned in connection with our offering of corporate trust services  primarily our paying agent and escrow services 
trust fees declined during because of a reduced volume of business and a decrease in the spread income we earned on invested trust funds 
during the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell our trust business to a third party 
this transaction closed during investment management fees in declined to  from million during due to fewer assets being under management 
during the second quarter of  the third party investment management firm that had been providing sub advisory services to the bank s clients became the primary investment advisor and assumed all portfolio management responsibilities for our wealth management customers 
the million loss during related to bulk purchased mortgage loans was primarily due to economic hedges associated with our residential mortgage loans held for sale 
in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with these loans held for sale  we entered into forward loan sale commitments 
the loss resulted from a realized settlement loss on matured forward loan sale commitments and an unrealized gain of  on the unsettled outstanding forward loan sales as of december  in addition  during the fourth quarter we sold approximately million of mortgage loans held for sale and recorded a small gain 
during  we recorded gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities of million from the sale of approximately million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year 
the million loss recorded in was an other than temporary impairment of one private label mortgage backed security 
see investment securities below for a further discussion 
other derivative income totaled million during  compared to million during the income in was primarily attributable to recording the initial fair value from the offering of derivative instruments to our customers 
other derivative income in was comprised of  from customer derivatives and million from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges

standby letters of credit and other loan fees totaled million during  compared to  during the increase in fees during was primarily due to our expanded asset based lending operations 
our employees deferred compensation plan allows the participants to direct the investments of their deferred compensation in selected mutual funds 
the investment in these mutual funds are assets of the company and carried at fair value  while an equal and offsetting liability is recorded to reflect the obligation of the 
table of contents company to the plan participants 
the change in the fair value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in our liability to deferred compensation plan participants is included in salary expense and  therefore  has no net impact on the company s operating results 
during  the fair value of these assets increased by  compared to a decline in the fair value of million in other noninterest income includes fees from automated teller machines  safe deposit box rentals  fees from insurance and financial planning services  and gains or losses from investments in limited partnerships

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense was million during  an increase of million  or  as compared to noninterest expense of million during the increase in expense was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense of million and nonperforming asset expense of million 
these increases were partly offset by lower fdic assessments of million 
total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expense in was largely due to the higher base salaries and sales incentives at cole taylor mortgage as that business added new employees during the total number of employees at the company was at december   compared to at december  
table of contents nonperforming asset expense increased to million during as compared to million during the increase was primarily associated with additional write downs on other real estate owned during the amount of nonperforming asset expense is impacted by the complexity and number of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned and could continue to be significant in future periods 
our fdic insurance premium decreased in from  primarily due to the nonrecurring fdic special assessment in the second quarter of of million

our efficiency ratio was in  compared to in the impact of higher nonperforming asset expense was mostly offset by higher net interest and noninterest income 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense was million during  an increase of million  or  as compared to noninterest expense of million during the increase in expense was primarily due to higher fdic assessments of million and higher nonperforming asset expense of million 
these increases were partly offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense of million  a million decrease in losses on early extinguishment of debt  and general decreases in other categories of expense 
total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million during  a reduction of million  or 
the decline in was largely due to higher sign on bonuses and severance we incurred in as part of the implementation of our growth strategy 
in addition  lower incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits during  partly offset by an increase in base salaries  also contributed to the decrease in expense 
during  we put in place certain expense control measures to reduce salaries and benefits costs  which included reducing staffing levels  eliminating annual cash based incentive awards and suspending the annual merit increase 
salaries  employment taxes  and medical insurance expenses increased million  or  to million during  compared to million for most of the increase in salaries was associated with an increase in the liability to our deferred compensation plan participants caused by an increase in the fair value of assets held in the plan 
during  the market value of these assets increased by  compared to a decline in the market value of million in the change in the market value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan is reported in noninterest income  and the offsetting change in our liability to these participants is reported in salary expense and has no net impact on the company s operating results 
the remainder of the increase was due to higher base salaries associated with our growth strategy and the additional hiring that took place in these increases were partly offset by a decrease in employment taxes and medical insurance 
as part of our expense control measures  we reduced the number of full time equivalent employees by eliminating certain positions in the first quarter of the number of full time employees was at december   compared to at december  sign on bonuses and severance expense was  in and consisted primarily of severance costs 
sign on bonuses and severance expense was million in  and consisted of severance expense of million and sign on bonuses of million 
the higher expense in was associated with severance related to changes in senior management and certain of our supporting staff and signing bonuses to attract new employees 
incentives  commissions  and retirement benefits also decreased during to million  as compared to million during the decrease was largely due to expenses in for guaranteed bonuses  primarily as a result of our recruiting activities 
in addition  lower sales incentives also contributed to the decrease in expense in 
table of contents occupancy of premises expense increased to million during  compared to million during  an increase of  or

additional write downs and higher losses on the disposition of other real estate owned during also contributed to the increase in expense 
the amount of nonperforming asset expense is impacted by the complexity and number of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned and could continue to be significant in future periods 
fdic assessments increased in  compared to  because the fdic imposed an industry wide special assessment and a general increase in premiums for all financial institutions

fdic assessments were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
fdic assessments in included an industry wide special assessment to help recapitalize the fdic s deposit insurance fund  which amounted to million 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher insurance assessments that went into effect for all financial institutions

at december   the bank s prepaid fdic premiums totaled million and were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
legal fees were million in  as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
legal fees are reported net of reimbursements received from customers

as of december   we did not have additional brokered cds that we can call at our option 
other professional fees totaled million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
most of the decrease was associated with lower third party asset management fees paid to the sub advisor for our investment management clients

table of contents income taxes during  despite a pre tax loss of million  we recorded total income tax expense of million 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
the tax expense recorded in was largely due to the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to other comprehensive income 
these residual tax effects resulted from changes in the deferred tax liability associated with deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income 
we expect additional income tax expense of  during as a result of the release of the residual tax effects 
since the third quarter of  we have maintained a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because we concluded that  based upon the weight of all available evidence  it was more likely than not that not all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance increased million during to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the required valuation allowance was largely due to the increase in our net deferred tax assets and changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance solely attributable to identifiable events recorded in other comprehensive income  primarily changes in unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities  the tax effects of which were allocated to other comprehensive income 
at december   the net deferred tax asset  after considering the million valuation allowance  was million  which was supported by available tax planning strategies 
we evaluate the valuation allowance each quarter taking into account our inventory of deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those recorded on items included in equity as other comprehensive income  which are recorded net of tax

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services

during the year  we received million of proceeds from the sale of primarily mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by ginnie mae  fannie mae and freddie mac and recorded gains of million 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year to reposition our portfolio 
offsetting these sales were purchases of billion of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the overall weighted average life of our investment portfolio at december  was approximately years  compared to approximately years at december  mortgage related securities include residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  and comprised of our investment portfolio at december   compared to at december  as of december   over of mortgage related securities that we held were securities issued by government and government sponsored enterprises  such as ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
we do not hold subprime loans in our mortgage related investment securities portfolio 
while the fair value of these securities has been impacted by market illiquidity  we do not modify the fair value determined by an independent pricing service  but take additional steps to review for other than temporary impairment

we analyzed each of these securities to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
our analysis included an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings  and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based on the location of the collateral and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we obtained fair value estimates from additional independent sources and performed cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
of the securities with gross unrealized losses at december   only three securities have been in a loss position for months or more  including one security for which we recognized other than temporary impairment during the fourth quarter of our analysis at december   indicated that these three securities did not have other than temporary impairment or did not have any additional other than temporary impairment 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements investment securities from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the other than temporary impairment charge that the company recorded in was adjusted effective april  when the company adopted amended accounting guidance on investments in debt and equity securities which modified the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment and changed the model used to determine the amount of impairment 
under the revised guidance  declines in fair value of investment securities below their amortized costs basis that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as a realized loss to the extent the impairment is related to credit loss 
the amount of impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
we recorded the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income for one private label mortgage related security for which an other than temporary impairment was recognized in the fourth quarter of through earnings

total commercial loans decreased to billion at year end  compared to billion at december  and billion at december  although we originated new loans during  including the funding of approximately million of new commercial loans  this growth was more than offset as we repositioned our portfolio to reduce our exposure in industries and sectors that we no longer consider desirable 
in addition  loan charge offs and low line usage by our customers combined to produce lower commercial loan balances in commercial and industrial c i loans are loans to businesses or for business purposes that are either unsecured or secured by collateral other than commercial real estate 
total c i loans increased million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  these loans are generally made to operating companies in a variety of businesses  but do not include commercial real estate investment loans

our residential real estate construction and loan portfolio decreased million  or  during to million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  because of the continued slow down in the residential real estate markets and reduced real estate valuations  we have been actively reducing our exposure to this portion of the loan portfolio

this business sources mortgages through both retail offices and brokers throughout the united states  as well as through the chicago based banking centers 
currently  we sell the all the loans originated by this unit to institutional investors rather than hold the loans for portfolio 
in  in an effort to reduce the level of nonperforming loans  we decided to sell certain of our commercial nonaccrual loans 
in connection with this decision  during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of a group of loans 
we also transferred certain other nonaccrual commercial loans into the held for sale category as we actively marketed these loans for sale 
upon transfer into the held for sale category  we recorded a charge off to reduce the loans to their estimated net fair value 
we also had residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale at december   which we intended to sell to third party institutional investors 
during the third quarter of  we purchased a participation interest in pools of residential single family mortgages totaling approximately million 
these loans were to have been pooled into pass through certificates to be issued by a mortgage originator and guaranteed by the government national mortgage association  otherwise known as ginnie mae  and sold to third party investors 
the mortgage originator completed the securitization of a portion of these loans in early august and we received payment for the sale of these loans 
however  the mortgage loan originator was not able to securitize the remaining single family loans because ginnie mae removed the originator from its list of eligible issuers  so we 
table of contents took possession of the underlying collateral 
during  we sold approximately million of these loans for a loss of million  compared to sales of approximately million of these loans in the fourth quarter of at a small gain 
any remaining loans were transferred to the loan portfolio by the end of nonperforming assets our lending officers and their managers are responsible for the ongoing review of present and projected future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  a loan review function independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee about the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level 
the committee evaluates whether the loan is appropriately risk rated and determines if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
most loans rated substandard or below are transferred to a separate loan work out department  staffed by collection professionals 
we have increased the size of our loan work out department to effectively handle the increased volume of nonperforming assets

the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans also increased during and totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for losses on impaired loans in was primarily due to an increase in the estimated impairment on these loans  partially offset by net charge offs during the period 
once we determine that a loan is impaired  we perform an individual analysis to establish the amount of the related allowance for loan losses  if any  based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based upon the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
generally  since the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent real estate loans  the fair value is determined by a current appraisal 
the individual impairment analysis also considers available and reliable borrower guarantees and any cross collateralization agreements 
certain other loans are collateralized by business assets  such as equipment  inventory  and accounts receivable 
the fair value of these loans is based upon estimates of realizability and collectability of the underlying collateral 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the impairment analysis may not result in a related allowance for loan losses for each individual loan 
at december   we determined that million of our loans were impaired and had related allowances for loan losses of million 
we also held million of impaired loans  for which the individual analysis did not result in a measure of impairment  so no related allowance for loan losses was provided 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans  accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal  as well as troubled debt restructurings 
unless modified in a troubled debt restructuring  certain homogenous loans  such as residential 
table of contents mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and are  therefore  excluded from impaired loans 
as of december   we had five commercial loans  totaling million which were considered to have a higher risk of noncompliance with the existing loan terms

as of december   these potential problem loans totaled million of which million were in our secured by commercial real estate portfolio  million were in our commercial and industrial portfolio  and the remaining million were loans in the construction and land portfolio 
in comparison  potential problem loans at december  totaled million 
the largest categories of potential problem loans at december  were construction and land loans of million and c i loans of million 
the remaining million were loans in our commercial real estate secured category 
we do not necessarily expect to realize losses on potential problem loans  but we recognize potential problem loans can carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 
we calculate the formula portion of the allowance by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  residential real estate construction  commercial real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage  and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification for commercial loans and by delinquency status for consumer loans 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further 
table of contents categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  such as home equity loans and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  grouping loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates based upon current and prior years charge off experience for each separate loan grouping identified 
the historical loss rates are then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the allowance reflects loss experience from the last three years while the allowance reflects loss experience from the preceding two year period 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the loan groupings  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but where the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of either expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
in recent periods  our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the estimated recoverable amount of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
however  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 

table of contents the following table shows an analysis of our allowance for loan losses and other related data for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans total loans at end of year allowance for loan losses allowance at beginning of year charge offs commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate mortgages consumer subtotal recoveries commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate mortgages consumer subtotal total net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance at end of year annual net charge offs to average total loans allowance to total loans excluding loans held for sale at end of year allowance to nonperforming loans consumer loan charge offs and recoveries include charge offs and recoveries relating to indirect and direct auto loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdrafts and all other types of consumer loans 
our allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of end of year loans excluding loans held for sale and of nonperforming loans 
in comparison  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of total loans excluding loans held for sale and of nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
total nonperforming loans increased from million at december   to million at december   while the level of impaired loans increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the deterioration of loans to banks and bank holding companies 
this deterioration  and our continued efforts to resolve our nonperforming assets and impaired loans  resulted in an increased provision for loan losses  higher charge offs in  and an overall increase in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents we charge off loans when the loss is highly probable and clearly identified 
during  net charge offs were million  or of average loans 
in comparison  during net charge offs were million  or of average loans  and million  or of average loans  during in both and  most of our loan charge offs were from our real estate construction portfolio  primarily residential construction and land loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula or specific allowances 
during  we increased the unallocated portion of allowance for loan losses in response to the increase in problem loans and because of the economic downturn  which increased the uncertainty inherent in our computation of the allowance for loan losses  including the expected loss rates applied to our portfolio 
in increasing the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses in  we considered the uncertainty surrounding current real estate and collateral valuations  the duration of the economic downturn and its impact on business conditions  forecasts of national and local economic conditions  concern about exposure in portions of the loan portfolio that were no longer considered economically desirable  and other factors 
during and  we reduced the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses as the formula portion of our allowance increased as a result of the our historical loss experience rates including the historically high level of net charge offs during the past three years 
in addition to the higher loss experience and the reduced level of nonperforming and impaired loans  our considerations in the determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses included  but were not limited to  the current national and local economic climate  forecasts of economic recovery  proactive reductions to certain exposures in our loan portfolio  and our current lending policies  underwriting standards and loan review system 
as a commercial bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have higher potential for losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 

table of contents the table below presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

the program consists of two parts the tag program and the debt guarantee program  both of which the bank elected to participate in 
we did not issue any debt under the debt guarantee program 
under the tag program  all noninterest bearing transaction accounts were fully guaranteed by the fdic through december  during  the fdic assessed us a basis point annual surcharge applied to noninterest bearing transaction and certain low interest bearing transaction deposit amounts over  as part of its normal quarterly assessment process for participation in the tag program 
this compares to an annual surcharge assessment increase of basis points in for participation in tag program 
in addition to cds from our local market customers  we used other sources of time deposits to help fund our liquidity and funding needs 
in october  we entered the cdars network 
this network allows us to accommodate depositors with large cash balances to seek full deposit insurance protection  by placing these funds in cds issued by other banks in the network 
through a matching system  we receive funds back for cds that we issue for other banks in the network  thus allowing us to retain the full amount of the original deposit 
at december   we had million of deposits in the cdars program  as compared to million at december  we also utilize out of market cds to fund the portion of our interest earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the 
table of contents country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts that allow the purchasers to obtain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of cds obtained through this channel was million at december   as compared to million at december   and million at december  we also issue brokered cds to support our asset growth  but we continued to reduce our reliance on this source of funding in the balance of our brokered cds was million at december   million at december   and million at december  total brokered money market balances also decreased in to million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at december  and  the scheduled maturities of brokered cds were as follows maturity in thousands within one year after one year but within two years after two years but within three years after three years subtotal unamortized fair value adjustment unamortized broker placement fees and other discounts total brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and other discounts and are amortized to the maturity date of the related brokered cds and included in deposit interest expense

there were no brokered cds called by us in the year ended december  other borrowings our other borrowings totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  other borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos  federal funds purchased and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the increase in total other borrowings was largely a result of increases of million in repurchase agreements and million in federal funds purchased 
repos include overnight and term agreements 
the overnight repos are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
overnight repos totaled million at december  and million at december  our term repos totaled million at december  and million at december  during  we paid million of repo agreements early and incurred  of expense recorded as early extinguishment of debt within noninterest expense 
there are million of repo agreements that remain callable at the counterparty s option and are scheduled to mature in in addition  the repurchase agreements allow the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to the call date if the bank were to lose its well capitalized status

preferred stock in may  we completed an exchange offering in which all of our outstanding series a preferred were converted into million shares of common stock that included million shares as an inducement for series a preferred holders to convert into common shares 
the million value attributed to the additional shares was considered a non cash implied dividend to holders of the series a preferred and resulted in no net impact to total stockholders equity 
this non cash dividend was a deduction in arriving at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and was considered in the determination of basic and diluted loss per common share

regulatory capital we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier capital includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
bank regulators  however  also specifically approved the series b preferred for inclusion in tier capital in spite of its cumulative dividend feature 
total capital represents tier capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan loss up to certain limits  subordinated debt and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier capital 
at each december   december   and december   the company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
the company s total capital ratio increased in  largely due to increases in regulatory capital caused by our 
table of contents subordinated debt issuance in which more than outweighed the increase in risk weighted assets 
the ratios of tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets declined compared to the ratio of total capital as tier capital was lower during as well as higher average assets and risk weighted assets 
all of the company s regulatory ratios at december  declined as compared to those at december   largely due to a decline in regulatory capital caused by our net loss applicable to common stockholders 
at each of december   december   and december   the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
all of the bank s ratios increased during as the bank s net loss was offset by the million capital contribution 
while we  as well as our bank  continue to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory capital guidelines  our regulators could require us to maintain capital in excess of these required levels

table of contents liquidity in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from in market deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank uses brokered deposits  borrowings from the fhlb and frb  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet its liquidity needs 
during  we worked to improve our liquidity position by increasing funding from core customers which allowed us to reduce our reliance on brokered deposits 
we also used available collateral to take advantage of attractively priced short term funding provided by the fhlb and the frb 
we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use

at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral at the frb with a lendable value of approximately million 
the bank also has pledged million of investment securities and million of qualified first mortgage residential  home equity and commercial real estate loans at the fhlb and had a total borrowing capacity of million at december  the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity 
our total assets increased to billion at december  and billion at december  during  our loan portfolio increased by a net of million  or  while our investment securities portfolio decreased by million  or

total deposits increased by million  or  and other borrowings increased by million  or

holding company liquidity historically  the primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
because of the net losses incurred by the bank in recent years  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the company in or the bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  under which the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
as of december   the bank could not declare or pay dividends to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities 
at december   company had cash of million for general corporate purposes and to support future growth 
the primary source of cash at the holding company was from the issuance of series c preferred and series e preferred stock 
in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of our series c preferred and million from the issuance of our series e preferred and associated warrants 
during  cash outflows at the company included a million capital contributions to the bank  million of cash dividend payments on preferred stock issuances and general operating expenses 
in the first quarter of  we announced the sale of million of a new series of preferred stock in a private placement to existing investors 
the company intends to use the proceeds to provide additional capital to the bank 
as we continue to grow our business  as well as manage our loan portfolio  we may require additional capital  either from earnings retention or external sources 
we continue to review and evaluate our capital plan in conjunction with our business strategy as well as the heightened focus on capital requirements by regulatory authorities and the investment community 
the timing  amount and form of any such capital raise will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of earnings generated by the bank  the opportunities for future growth  further loan losses  regulatory requirements and the state of the capital markets 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts  and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and december   respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn  and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees to the extent not already recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we established a liability for million for commitments under standby letters of credit for which we believed funding and loss were probable

derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to accommodate customer needs and to assist in our own interest rate risk management 
from time to time  we use interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  and interest rate floors and collars to manage the interest rate risk associated with our commercial loan portfolio and our portfolio of fixed rate brokered cds

table of contents in order to accommodate individual customer borrowing needs  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with customers 
at the same time  in order to offset the exposure and manage interest rate risk  we entered into an interest rate swap with a different counterparty with offsetting terms 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value of these instruments  as well as any net cash settlements  are recognized in noninterest income as other derivative income or expense 
as of december  and  we had notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of interest rate swaps with customers in which we agreed to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate 
in addition  as of december  and december   we had offsetting interest rate swaps with other counterparties with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  in which we agreed to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
the company enters into interest rate lock and forward loan sale commitments as a normal part of cole taylor mortgage s business 
these non hedging derivatives are recorded at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets with changes in fair value recorded in income currently in noninterest income 
in january  we terminated a million notional amount interest rate swap that was not designated as an accounting hedge 
we discontinued hedge accounting in december  when we determined the hedge would no longer be effective 
the unrealized gain of million upon de designation  which had accumulated in other comprehensive income net of tax  was being amortized to loan interest income over what would have been the life of the hedge 
from the date of de designation to december   the change in fair value  along with net settlements attributed to this period  was recorded in other derivative income in noninterest income and totaled  this derivative was terminated in january and we received a cash payment million  which represented the fair value of the swap at the date of termination 
at december  and december   we had  and million  respectively  in accumulated other comprehensive income related to terminated cash flow hedges 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents the net unamortized portion of the deferred gain that had accumulated in other comprehensive income when the hedging relationship was terminated 
during and  million and million of deferred gains  respectively  from previously terminated cash flow hedges were reclassified into net interest income as additional loan interest income 
we expect that million of these deferred gains will be amortized into loan interest income during for additional details concerning the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments  please see application of critical accounting policies derivative financial instruments from our management s discussion and analysis contained elsewhere in this annual report 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors and collars  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts can be designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to increase by million  or  as compared to the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was a decrease of million  or lower than the rates unchanged scenario 
no simulation for net interest income at risk in a falling rate scenario was calculated because of the low level of market interest rates at both december  and computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and december  change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year n a n a n a n a n a not applicable 
table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb frb stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings notes payable other advances junior subordinated debentures subordinated notes  net total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on a gap analysis 
management considers earnings at risk simulation modeling to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor interest rate risk from an economic perspective with an economic value of equity analysis 
this measure is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
litigation we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business 
management knows of no such threatened or pending legal actions against us that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  liquidity or operating results
