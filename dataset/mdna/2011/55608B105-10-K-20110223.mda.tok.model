item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the recent economic recession and adverse equity and credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 
we have recently experienced the worst economic period since the great depression 
the equity and credit markets experienced volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
should the credit and financial market conditions become disrupted again  our ability to raise equity or obtain capital  to repay or refinance credit facilities at maturity  pay significant capital expenditures or fund growth  is likely to be costly and or impaired 
our access to debt financing in particular will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit history and credit capacity  as well as the historical performance of our businesses and lender perceptions of their and our financial prospects 
in the event we are unable to obtain debt financing  particularly as significant credit facilities mature  our internal sources of liquidity may not be sufficient 
the current economic recession also increases our counterparty risk  particularly in those businesses whose revenues are determined under multi year contracts  such as imtt and district energy 
in this environment  we would expect to see increases in counterparty defaults and or bankruptcies  which could result in an increase in bad debt expense and may cause our operating results to decline 
the volatility in the financial markets makes projections regarding future obligations under pension plans difficult 
two of our businesses  the gas company and imtt  have defined benefit retirement plans 
future funding obligations under those plans depend in large part on the future performance of plan assets and the mix of investment assets 
our defined benefit plans hold a significant amount of equity securities as well as fixed income securities 
if the market values of these securities decline or if interest rates decline  our pension expense and cash funding requirements would increase and  as a result  could materially adversely affect our results and liquidity 
if borrowing costs increase or if debt terms become more restrictive  the cost of refinancing and servicing our debt will increase  reducing our profitability and ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
the majority of indebtedness at our businesses matures within three to four years 
refinancing this debt may result in substantially higher interest rates or margins or substantially more restrictive covenants 
either event may limit operational flexibility or reduce dividends and or distributions from our operating businesses to us  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
we also cannot provide assurance that we or the other owners of any of our businesses will be able to make capital contributions to repay some or all of the debt if required 
the debt facilities at our businesses contain terms that become more restrictive over time  with stricter covenants and increased amortization schedules 
those terms will limit our ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability 
our businesses including businesses in which we invest are subject to numerous statutes  rules and regulations relating to environmental protection 
atlantic aviation is subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage  transport  pumping and transfer of fuel  and district energy is subject to requirements relating mainly to its handling of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
the gas company is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining  handling  storage and transportation of combustible products 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage 
any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results 
in addition  disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows 
imtt s operations in particular are subject to complex  stringent and expensive environmental regulation and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty 
imtt also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us  as could significant unexpected compliance costs 
further  these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes that could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses  significant capital expenditures and or increased ongoing operating costs 
a number of the properties owned by imtt have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which imtt is liable 
these remediation obligations exist principally at imtt s bayonne and lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated or both 
in addition  imtt may discover additional environmental contamination at its bayonne  lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to imtt 
further  the past contamination of the properties owned by imtt  including by former owners or operators of such properties  could result in remediation obligations  personal injury  property damage  environmental damage or similar claims by third parties 
we may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination  including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel  hazardous materials or other pollutants 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental statutes  rules and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous materials 
these laws often impose liability  whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous materials 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements 
the presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  environmental damage and or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
climate change  climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets 
climate change is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities 
there is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which our climate is changing  the possible causes of this change and its potential impacts 
some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
the outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in significant new regulations  additional changes to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions 
these actions could increase the costs of operating our businesses  reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers  any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  climate change could make severe weather events more frequent  which would increase the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged infrastructure at our businesses 
energy efficiency and technology advances  as well as conservation efforts  may result in reduced demand for our products and services 
the trend toward increased conservation  as well as technological advances  including installation of improved insulation  the development of more efficient heating and cooling devices and advances in energy generation technology  may reduce demand for certain of our products and services 
during periods of high energy commodity costs  the prices of certain of our products and services generally increase  which may lead to customer conservation 
in addition  federal and or state regulation may require mandatory conservation measures  which would also reduce demand 
a reduction in demand for our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations 
our businesses are dependent on our relationships  on a contractual and regulatory level  with government entities that may have significant leverage over us 
government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us 
our businesses generally are  and will continue to be  subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies 
in addition  our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits  licenses  concessions  leases or contracts 
government entities  due to the wide ranging scope of their authority  have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy  or increased administrative expense 
furthermore  government permits  licenses  concessions  leases and contracts are generally very complex  which may result in periods of non compliance  or disputes over interpretation or enforceability 
if we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations  we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business  or both 
where our ability to operate an infrastructure business is subject to a concession or lease from the government  the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability 
further  our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators 
increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of us assets  particularly infrastructure assets  by non us persons  given the non us ultimate ownership of our manager  may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions 
any such regulation may also limit our manager s ability to continue to manage our operations  which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance 
in addition  any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them 
failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
our contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract 
for instance  a lease  concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation 
in addition  government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations  or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations  separate from any contractual rights they may have 
governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses 
because our businesses provide basic services  and face limited competition  governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses and investments 
governmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability 
where our businesses or investments are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community  they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge 
we may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control 
we may be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that  despite a right of appeal  could result in our profits being negatively affected 
in addition  we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities  which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services 
businesses and investments we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations 
our income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety  health or environmental regulation 
our businesses and investments are subject to federal  state and local safety  health and environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified 
there is a risk that any one of our businesses or investments may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations  resulting in fines or penalties 
additionally  if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change  we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply 
because the regulatory environment frequently changes  we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses 
higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by general aviation customers  which would have a negative impact on the profitability of atlantic aviation 
higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers 
we may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses and investments 
we believe that infrastructure businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses  particularly those businesses that have operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas 
specifically  because of the combustible nature of the products of the gas company and consumer reliance on these products for basic services  the business sng plant  transmission pipelines  barges and storage facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses  which could affect its operations significantly 
any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would likely cause significant harm to our employees and assets 
as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york on september   insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
a terrorist attack that makes use of our property  or property under our control  may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage 
in addition  any further terrorist attack  regardless of location  could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings 
furthermore  it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage  which could cause our profitability to suffer 
we are dependent on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate our businesses on a stand alone basis  relying on existing management teams for day to day operations 
consequently  our operational success  as well as the success of our internal growth strategy  will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our businesses  who have extensive experience in the day to day operations of these businesses 
furthermore  we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to imtt we share ownership and voting control of imtt with a third party 
our ability to exercise significant influence over the business or level of distributions from imtt is limited  and we may be negatively impacted by disagreements with our co investor regarding imtt s business and operations 
we own of imtt  the we do not own is owned by members of imtt s founding family 
our co investor manages the day to day operations of imtt  and our ability to influence the business is limited to our rights under the shareholder agreement governing our investment in imtt 
our co investor may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with our interests and goals  and may take actions that are contrary to our business objectives and requests 
we may not agree with our co investor as to the payment  amount or timing of distributions or as to transactions such as significant capital expenditures  acquisitions or dispositions of assets and financings 
disputes with our co investor may result in litigation or arbitration that could be costly and would divert the attention of our management 
our inability to exercise control over the management of imtt s business could materially adversely affect imtt s and our results of operations 
distribution of funds to the company from imtt is governed by the shareholders agreement between the company and the co investor that owns the remaining stake 
the co investor has refused to vote in favor of distributing certain of these funds  and the company believes that such a refusal violates the shareholders agreement 
as a result  the company has formally initiated the dispute resolution process in the shareholders agreement  and intends to proceed to arbitration with the co investor if a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached within the timeframe prescribed in the shareholders agreement 
although we expect that the day to day operations of existing facilities will run as usual at imtt during this dispute  no assurance can be given that this dispute will not adversely impact the operations of imtt 
we also cannot assure you that this dispute will be resolved favorably for us or within the time frame expected  that any negative publicity will not adversely effect the company or imtt  or that the costs involved  and the possible diversion of management s attention  will not adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  the value and trading price of our llc interests may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of this dispute 
imtt s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
demand for imtt s bulk liquid storage is largely a function of us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and  less significantly  the extent to which such products are imported into and or exported out of the united states 
us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products is influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  growth in the us economy  the pricing of chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and their substitutes 
import and export volumes of these products to and from the united states are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the united states and overseas  the cost of producing chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products domestically vis aga vis overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the united states and overseas destinations 
specifically  production of natural gas from mainland north america may increase or decrease the demand for bulk liquid storage 
this is a developing situation and the effects are not yet predictable 
in addition  changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products  including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported products  could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the united states 
a reduction in demand for bulk liquid storage  particularly in the new york harbor or the lower mississippi river  as a consequence of lower us domestic demand for  or imports exports of  chemical  petroleum or vegetable and animal oil products  could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by a substantial increase in bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
an increase in available bulk liquid storage capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which imtt operates  such as new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and could adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of one or more large customers 
imtt has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of imtt s revenue and gross profit 
in  excluding bp  imtt s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately of terminal revenue 
the insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business involves hazardous activities and is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks 
we cannot assure you that imtt is  or will be in the future  adequately insured against all such risks 
the transportation  handling and storage of petroleum  chemical and vegetable and animal oil products are subject to the risk of spills  leakage  contamination  fires and explosions 
any of these events may result in loss of revenue  loss of reputation or goodwill  fines  penalties and other liabilities 
in certain circumstances  such events could also require imtt to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred 
consistent with industry practice  imtt carries insurance to protect against most of the accident related risks involved in the conduct of the business  however  the limits of imtt s coverage mean imtt cannot insure against all risks 
in addition  because imtt s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war  such an attack that significantly damages one or more of imtt s major facilities would have a negative impact on imtt s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
further  future losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the us gulf region may result in lower insurance coverage and or increased insurance premiums for imtt s properties in louisiana 
risks related to the gas company disruptions or shutdowns at either of the oil refineries on oahu from which the gas company obtains both lpg and the primary feedstock for its sng plant may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business 
the gas company manufactures sng and distributes sng and lpg 
sng feedstock or lpg supply disruptions or refinery shutdowns that limit the business ability to manufacture and or deliver gas to customers could increase costs as a result of an inability to source feedstock at acceptable rates 
the extended unavailability of one or both of the refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to hawaii could also result in an increased reliance on imported sources 
an inability to purchase lpg from foreign sources would adversely affect operations 
the business is also limited in its ability to store lpg  and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of lpg stocks 
currently  the business has only one contracted source of feedstock for sng  the tesoro refinery  and if tesoro chooses to discontinue the production or sale of feedstock to the business  which they could do with little notice  the gas company s utility business would suffer a significant disruption and potentially incur significant operating cost increases and or capital expenditures until alternative supplies of feedstock could be developed 
all supply disruptions of sng or lpg  if occurring for an extended period  could adversely impact the business contribution margin and cash flows 
in  chevron considered converting its hawaii refinery to a storage terminal 
chevron concluded that it would continue operating as a refinery in hawaii  however  chevron has publicly stated that it is considering other alternatives for this facility 
chevron s hawaii refinery supplied the gas company with approximately one third of its total lpg purchases in any decision by chevron regarding its operations in hawaii could affect the business cost of lpg and may adversely impact its non utility contribution margin and profitability 
the most significant costs for the gas company are locally sourced lpg  lpg imports and feedstock for the sng plant  the costs of which are directly related to petroleum prices 
to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business contribution margin and cash flows will be adversely affected 
the profitability of the gas company is based on the margin of sales prices over costs 
since lpg and feedstock for the sng plant are commodities  changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs 
in addition  increased reliance on higher priced foreign sources of lpg  whether as a result of disruptions to or shortages in local sources or otherwise  could also have a significant impact on costs 
the gas company has no control over these costs  and  to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely affected 
higher prices could result in reduced customer demand or customer conversion to alternative energy sources  or both  that would reduce the volume of gas sold and adversely affect the profitability of the gas company 
the gas company relies on its sng plant  including its transmission pipeline  for a significant portion of its sales 
disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business ability to serve customers 
disruptions at the sng plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of the gas company to produce sng 
most of the utility sales on oahu are of sng and all sng is produced at the oahu plant 
disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on the gas company s sales and cash flows 
the operations of the gas company are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors  particularly those involved in other energy sources  could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
other fuel sources such as electricity  diesel  solar energy  geo thermal  wind  other gas providers and alternative energy sources may be substituted for certain gas end use applications  particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources  whether due to higher commodity supply costs or otherwise 
customers could  for a number of reasons  including increased gas prices  lower costs of alternative energy or convenience  meet their energy needs through alternative sources 
this could have an adverse effect on the business revenue and cash flows 
the gas company s utility business is subject to regulation by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  and actions by the hpuc or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business 
if the business fails to comply with certain hpuc regulatory conditions  the profitability of the gas company could be adversely impacted 
the business agreed to regulatory conditions with the hpuc that address a variety of matters including a requirement that the gas company and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital does not exceed  and a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at the gas company  hgc or mic 
the hpuc regulates all franchised or certificated public service companies operating in hawaii  prescribes rates  tariffs  charges and fees  determines the allowable rate of earnings in establishing rates  issues guidelines concerning the general management of franchised or certificated utility businesses  and acts on requests for the acquisition  sale  disposition or other exchange of utility properties  including mergers and consolidations 
any adverse decision by the hpuc concerning the level or method of determining utility rates  the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base  the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding  could have an adverse effect on the business 
the gas company s operations on the islands of hawaii  maui and kauai rely on lpg that is transported to those islands by jones act qualified barges from oahu and from non jones act vessels from foreign ports 
disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the business results of operations 
the jones act requires that all goods transported by water between us ports be carried in us flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements 
the business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that currently have a cargo capacity of approximately  gallons and  gallons of lpg each 
the barges used by the business are the only two jones act qualified barges available in the hawaiian islands capable of carrying large volumes of lpg 
they are near the end of their useful economic lives 
if the barges are unable to transport lpg from oahu and the business is not able to secure foreign source lpg or obtain an exemption to the jones act  that would permit importation of a sufficient quantity of lpg from the mainland us  the profitability of the business could be adversely impacted 
the gas company is subject to risks associated with volatility in the hawaii economy 
tourism and government activities including the military are two of the largest components of hawaii s economy 
hawaii s economy is heavily influenced by economic conditions in the us and asia and their impact on tourism  as well as by government spending 
as a result of the economic downturn  hawaii has experienced significant declines in levels of tourism which have affected the local economy generally 
a large portion of the gas company s sales are generated by businesses that rely on tourism 
if the local economy fails to improve or declines  the volume of gas sold could be negatively affected by business closures and or lower usage and adversely impact the business financial performance 
additionally  a lack of growth in the hawaii economy could reduce the level of new residential construction  and adversely impact growth in volume from new residential customers 
a reduction in government activity  particularly military activity  or a shift by either away from the use of gas products  could also have a negative impact on the gas company s results 
because of its geographic location  hawaii  and in turn the gas company  is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations 
hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks  such as hurricanes  floods  heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves 
because the business sng plant  sng transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean  weather related disruptions to operations are possible 
in addition  earthquakes may cause disruptions 
these events could damage the business assets or could result in wide spread damage to its customers  thereby reducing the volume of gas sold and  to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance  the business revenue and cash flows 
risks related to district energy pursuant to the terms of a use agreement with the city of chicago  the city of chicago has rights that  if exercised  could have a significant negative impact on district energy 
in order to operate the district cooling system in downtown chicago  the business has obtained the right to use certain public ways of the city of chicago under a use agreement  which we refer to as the use agreement 
under the terms of the use agreement  the city of chicago retains the right to use the public ways for a public purpose and has the right in the interest of public safety or convenience to cause the business to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities at the expense of the business 
if the city of chicago exercises these rights  district energy could incur significant costs and its ability to provide service to its customers could be disrupted  which would have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use agreement is non exclusive  and the city of chicago is entitled to enter into use agreements with the business potential competitors 
the use agreement expires on december  and may be terminated by the city of chicago for any uncured material breach of its terms and conditions 
the city of chicago also may require district energy to pay liquidated damages of  a day if the business fails to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities when required to do so  if it installs any facilities that are not properly authorized under the use agreement or if the district cooling system does not conform to the city of chicago s standards 
each of these non compliance penalties could result in substantial financial loss or effectively shut down the district cooling system in downtown chicago 
any proposed renewal  extension or modification of the use agreement requires approval by the city council of chicago 
extensions and modifications subject to the city of chicago s approval include those to enable the expansion of chilling capacity and the connection of new customers to the district cooling system 
the city of chicago s approval is contingent upon the timely filing of an economic disclosure statement  or eds  disclosure required by illinois state law and chicago city ordinances to certify compliance with various laws and ordinances by us and certain of the beneficial owners of our stock 
if any of these investors fails to file a completed eds form within days of the city of chicago s request or files an incomplete or inaccurate eds  the city of chicago has the right to refuse to provide the necessary approval for any extension or modification of the use agreement or to rescind the use agreement altogether 
if the city of chicago declines to approve extensions or modifications to the use agreement  district energy may not be able to increase the capacity of its district cooling system and pursue its growth strategy 
furthermore  if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected as a result 
a certain number of our investors may be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements of the city of chicago and non compliance may result in the city of chicago s rescission or voidance of the use agreement and any other arrangements district energy may have with the city of chicago at the time of the non compliance 
in order to secure any amendment to the use agreement with the city of chicago to pursue expansion plans or otherwise  or to enter into other contracts with the city of chicago  the city of chicago may require any person who owns or acquires or more of our llc interests to make a number of representations to the city of chicago by filing a completed eds 
our llc agreement requires that in the event that we need to obtain approval from the city of chicago in the future for any specific matter  including to expand the district cooling system or to amend the use agreement  we and each of our then investors would need to submit an eds to the city of chicago within days of the city of chicago s request 
in addition  our llc agreement requires each investor to provide any supplemental information needed to update any eds filed with the city of chicago as required by the city of chicago and as requested by us from time to time 
any eds filed by an investor may become publicly available 
by completing and signing an eds  an investor will have waived and released any possible rights or claims which it may have against the city of chicago in connection with the public release of information contained in the eds and also will have authorized the city of chicago to verify the accuracy of information submitted in the eds 
the requirements and consequences of filing an eds with the city of chicago will make compliance with the eds requirements difficult for our investors 
if any investor fails to comply with the eds requirements on time or the city of chicago determines that any information provided in any eds is false  incomplete or inaccurate  the city of chicago may rescind or void the use agreement or any other arrangements thermal chicago has with the city of chicago  and pursue any other remedies available to them 
if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the business district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result 
if certain events within or beyond the control of district energy occur  district energy may be unable to perform its contractual obligations to provide chilling and heating services to its customers 
if  as a result  its customers elect to terminate their contracts  district energy may suffer loss of revenue 
in addition  district energy may be required to make payments to such customers for damages 
in the event of a shutdown of one or more of district energy s plants due to operational breakdown  strikes  the inability to retain or replace key technical personnel or events outside its control  such as an electricity blackout  or unprecedented weather conditions in chicago  district energy may be unable to continue to provide chilling and heating services to all of its customers 
as a result  district energy may be in breach of the terms of some or all of its customer contracts 
in the event that such customers elect to terminate their contracts with district energy as a consequence of their loss of service  its revenue may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  under a number of contracts  district energy may be required to pay damages to a customer in the event that a cessation of service results in loss to that customer 
northwind aladdin currently derives a majority of its operating cash flows from a contract with a single customer  the planet hollywood resort and casino  which emerged from bankruptcy several years ago 
if this customer were to enter into bankruptcy again  northwind s aladdin s contract may be amended or terminated and the business may receive no compensation  which could result in the loss of our investment in northwind aladdin 
northwind aladdin derives a majority of its cash flows from a contract with the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas to supply cold and hot water and back up electricity 
the aladdin resort and casino emerged from bankruptcy immediately prior to district energy s acquisition of northwind aladdin in september  and  during the course of those proceedings  the contract with northwind aladdin was amended to reduce the payment obligations of the aladdin resort and casino 
if the planet hollywood resort and casino were to enter into bankruptcy again and a cheaper source of the services that northwind aladdin provides can be found  this contract may be terminated or amended 
this could result in a total loss or significant reduction in district energy s income from northwind aladdin  for which the business may receive no compensation 
weather conditions and conservation efforts may negatively impact district energy s results of operations 
district energy s earnings are generated by the sale of cooling and heating services 
weather conditions that are significantly cooler or warmer than normal in district energy s service areas may reduce demand for the services it provides 
demand for our services may also be reduced by the conservation efforts of our customers and by any conservation mandated by regulations to curb the effects of climate change and global warming 
a reduction in demand for district energy s services could adversely affect district energy s results of operations 
risks related to atlantic aviation deterioration of business jet traffic at airports where atlantic aviation operates would cause atlantic aviation to default on its debt obligations 
as of december   atlantic aviation had total long term debt outstanding of million in term loan debt and million in capital expenditure facilities 
the terms of these debt arrangements require compliance with certain operating and financial covenants 
the ability of atlantic aviation to meet their respective debt service obligations and to refinance or repay their outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon cash produced by this business 
at december   atlantic aviation s current debt to ebitda ratio  as defined under its loan agreement  was x 
this compares with a maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio of x 
the maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio drops to x in march  a decline in business jet take offs and landings at airports where atlantic aviation operates fbos could result in a reduction of atlantic aviation s ebitda as defined under its loan agreement 
consequently  atlantic aviation could exceed the maximum permitted debt to ebitda ratio under its loan agreement and default on its debt obligations 
if the default remains uncured  the lenders under the loan agreement  may accelerate the repayment of the outstanding balance of the borrowings under the agreement 
if atlantic aviation is unable to repay or refinance this debt  it may be rendered insolvent 
a default on the debt obligations leading to bankruptcy or insolvency would cause atlantic aviation to default on its fbo leases and would allow the local airport authorities to terminate the leases 
deterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at airports that atlantic aviation services would have a material adverse impact on our business 
a large part of the business revenue is derived from fuel sales and other services provided to general aviation customers and  to a lesser extent  commercial air travelers 
an economic downturn could reduce the level of air travel  adversely affecting atlantic aviation 
general aviation travel is primarily a function of economic activity 
consequently  during periods of economic downturn  fbo customers are more likely to curtail air travel 
the economic downturn of and had a significant impact on the activity levels of many fbo customers  which resulted in significant declines in the gross profit of this business 
according to general aviation traffic data reported by the faa  business jet take offs and landings in the united states decreased by and in and  respectively 
as a result of these traffic declines  business jet traffic levels in were below their levels 
general aviation traffic recovered in as economic activity improved 
business jet take offs and landings increased by compared with levels 
however  business jet traffic levels remain lower than their levels 
the trajectory and pace of further general aviation traffic recovery could be impacted by the change in seasonal demand for fbo services or extreme adverse weather conditions 
if the economy experiences a renewed deterioration or negative sentiment regarding corporate jet usage re emerges  the business may experience a decline in the volumes of fuel sold  which could materially adversely affect the results of this business 
air travel and air traffic volume can also be affected by events that have nationwide and industry wide implications  such as the events of september   as well as local circumstances 
events such as wars  outbreaks of disease such as sars  and terrorist activities in the united states or overseas may reduce air travel 
local circumstances include downturns in the general economic conditions of the area where an airport is located or other situations in which the business major fbo customers relocates their home base or preferred fueling stop to alternative locations 
in addition  changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to general aviation travel  either for businesses or individuals  may cause a reduction in general aviation travel 
increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business revenue to decline 
atlantic aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures  and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue 
fbo operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors  including location of the facility relative to runways and street access  service  value added features  reliability and price 
many of atlantic aviation s fbos compete with one or more fbos at their respective airports  and  to a lesser extent  with fbos at nearby airports 
furthermore  leases related to fbo operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term 
some present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than atlantic aviation  which may negatively impact atlantic s aviation ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal 
some competitors may aggressively or irrationally price their bids for airport concessions  which may limit our ability to grow or renew our portfolio 
atlantic aviation s fbos do not have the right to be the sole provider of fbo services at any of its fbo locations 
the authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other fbo leases at the airport and new competitors could be established at those fbo locations 
the addition of new competitors may reduce  or impair atlantic aviation s ability to increase  the revenue of the fbo business 
increased pricing competition at atlantic aviation may have an adverse effect on market share and fuel margins  causing a decline in the profitability of that business 
some of atlantic aviation s competitors have recently pursued more aggressive pricing strategies 
these competitors operate fbos at a number of airports where atlantic aviation operates or at airports near where it operates 
excessive price discounting may cause fuel volume and market share decline  potential decline in hangar rentals and de icing and may result in increased margin pressure  adversely affecting the profitability of this business 
the termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the fbo leases would damage atlantic aviation s operations significantly 
atlantic aviation s revenue is derived from long term leases at airports and one heliport 
if atlantic aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of its leases  including upon insolvency  the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation 
additionally  leases at chicago midway  philadelphia  north east philadelphia  new orleans international and orange county airports and the metroport th street heliport in new york city  representing approximately of atlantic aviation s gross profit in  allow the relevant authority to terminate the lease at their convenience 
in each case  atlantic aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures 
atlantic aviation would also likely be in default under the loan agreements and be obliged to repay its lenders a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount 
any such events would have a material adverse effect on atlantic aviation s results of operations 
the transportation security administration  or tsa  is considering new regulations which could impair the relative convenience of general aviation and adversely affect demand for atlantic aviation s services 
the tsa has proposed new regulations known as the large aircraft security program lasp  which would require all us operators of general aviation aircraft exceeding  pounds maximum take off weight to implement security programs that are subject to tsa audit 
in addition  the proposed regulations would require airports servicing these aircraft to implement security programs involving additional security measures  including passenger and baggage screening 
the business believes these new regulations  if implemented  will affect many of atlantic aviation s customers and all of the airports at which it operates 
these rules  if adopted  could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of general aviation travel relative to commercial air travel and  therefore  may adversely impact demand for atlantic aviation s services 
the lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing decisions 
the business uses industry and airport specific general aviation traffic data published by the faa to identify trends in the fbo industry 
the business also uses this traffic data as a key input to decision making in strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing matters 
however  as noted by the faa on their website  the data has several limitations and challenges 
as a result  the use of the faa traffic data may result in conclusions in strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions or macro pricing decisions that are ultimately unfavorable 
risks related to ownership of our stock mic s inherently complex structure and financial reporting may make it difficult for some investors to value our llc interests 
we are a limited liability company structured as a non operating holding company of three operating businesses and one substantial  unconsolidated investment 
we have elected to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes 
our consolidated federal income tax group is comprised of two of our operating businesses 
our investment and one of our operating businesses file stand alone federal income tax returns 
to the extent we receive distributions either from our investment or operating business that is not a part of our tax group  and these distributions are characterized as a dividend for tax purposes as opposed to a return of capital  such distributions would be eligible for the federal dividends received deductions exclusion in calculating taxes 
these factors may make it difficult for some potential investors  particularly those without a moderate level of financial acumen  to accurately assess the value of our llc interests and may adversely impact the market for our llc interests 
our manager s decision to reinvest its quarterly base management fees in llc interests or retain the cash will affect holders of llc interests differently 
our manager  in its sole discretion  may elect to retain base management fees paid in cash or to reinvest such payments in additional llc interests 
in the event the manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional llc interests  the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders 
in the event the manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional llc interests  effectively returning the cash to us  such reinvestment will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by the manager 
either option may adversely impact the market for our llc interests 
our total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings 
our total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets  net  represented approximately of total assets from continuing operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets were primarily recognized as a result of the acquisitions of our businesses and investments 
other intangible assets consist primarily of airport operating rights  trade names and customer relationships 
on at least an annual basis  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and assess for impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives when there are triggering events or circumstances 
if the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value  impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down to fair value 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge to reported earnings 
we have recognized significant impairments in the past  and any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings and total capitalization  and could be material 
our total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets 
the depreciation and amortization of these assets may negatively impact our reported earnings 
the high level of intangible and physical assets written up to fair value upon acquisition of our businesses generates substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization 
these non cash items serve to lower net income as reported in our statement of operations as well as our taxable income 
the generation of net losses or relatively small net income may contribute to a net operating loss nol carryforward that can be used to offset currently taxable income in future periods 
however  the continued reporting of little or negative net income may adversely affect the attractiveness of the company among some potential investors and may reduce the market for our llc interests 
our manager s affiliation with macquarie group limited and the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price 
our manager is an affiliate of macquarie group limited and a member of the macquarie group 
from time to time  we have entered into  and in the future we may enter into  transactions and relationships involving macquarie group limited  its affiliates  or other members of the macquarie group 
such transactions have included and may include  among other things  the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the macquarie group serving as lender or counterparty  and financial advisory services provided to us by the macquarie group 
although our audit committee  all of the members of which are independent directors  is required to approve of any related party transactions  including those involving members of the macquarie group or its affiliates  the relationship of our manager to the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest 
in addition  as a result of our manager s being a member of the macquarie group  negative market perceptions of macquarie group limited generally or of macquarie s infrastructure management model  or macquarie group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles  may affect market perceptions of our company and cause a decline in the price of our llc interests unrelated to our financial performance and prospects 
our manager can resign with days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time  resulting in a disruption in our operations  which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our llc interests 
our manager has the right  under the management services agreement  to resign at any time with days notice  whether we have found a replacement or not 
the resignation of our manager will trigger mandatory repayment obligations under debt facilities at all of our operating companies other than imtt 
if our manager resigns  we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to do so quickly  our operations are likely to experience a disruption  our financial results could be adversely affected  perhaps materially  and the market price of our llc interests may decline substantially 
in addition  the coordination of our internal management  acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses and investments are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our manager and its affiliates 
furthermore  if our manager resigns  the company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the macquarie brand entirely  and change their names to remove any reference to macquarie 
this may cause the value of the company and the market price of our llc interests to decline 
in the event of the underperformance of our manager  we may be unable to remove our manager  which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our llc interests 
under the terms of the management services agreement  our manager must significantly underperform in order for the management services agreement to be terminated 
the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless our llc interests underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than in relative terms and more than in absolute terms in out of consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter  and the holders of a minimum of of the outstanding llc interests excluding any llc interests owned by our manager or any affiliate of the manager vote to remove our manager  our manager materially breaches the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continues unremedied for days after notice  our manager acts with gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the management services agreement  or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts  or our manager experiences certain bankruptcy events 
because our manager s performance is measured by the market performance of our llc interests relative to a benchmark index  even if the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless the market performance of our llc interests also significantly underperforms the benchmark index 
if we were unable to remove our manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the market price of our llc interests could be negatively affected 
certain provisions of the management services agreement and the operating agreement of the company makes it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the company and could deprive investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their llc interests 
in addition to the limited circumstances in which our manager can be terminated under the terms of the management services agreement  the management services agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized us exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market  the manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our manager or resign  terminate the management services agreement upon days written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee 
the termination fee payable on the manager s exercise of its right to resign as our manager subsequent to a delisting of our llc interests could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our shareholders 
furthermore  in the event of such a delisting  any proceeds from the sale  lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our company  subject to debt repayment obligations 
we would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of the company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of the manager 
these provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the llc interests owned by them 
the operating agreement of the company  which we refer to as the llc agreement  contains a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from acquiring  control of the company 
these provisions include restrictions on the company s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders  with the exception of our manager  modeled on the limitation contained in section of the delaware general corporation law  allowing only the company s board of directors to fill vacancies  including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed only for cause and by a shareholder vote of  requiring that only the company s chairman or board of directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders  prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the company s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders meeting  having a substantial number of additional llc interests authorized but unissued  providing the company s board of directors with broad authority to amend the llc agreement  and requiring that any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of our llc interests make a number of representations to the city of chicago in its standard form of eds  the current form of which is included in our llc agreement  which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report 
the market price and marketability of our llc interests may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
the market price of our llc interests may fluctuate significantly 
many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our llc interests and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings 
these factors include the following price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of macquarie group limited and or vehicles managed by the macquarie group or branded under the macquarie name or logo  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies  business development companies or companies in our sectors  which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies  changes in our earnings or variations in operating results  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  changes in regulatory policies or tax law  operating performance of companies comparable to us  and loss of funding sources 
risks related to taxation we have significant income tax net operating losses which may not be realized before they expire 
we have accumulated over million in federal nol carryforwards 
while we have concluded that all but million of the nols will more likely than not be realized  there can be no assurance that we will utilize the nols generated to date or any nols we might generate in the future 
in addition  we have incurred state nols and have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of those state nols 
as with our federal nols  there is also no assurance that we will utilize those state losses or future losses 
further  the state of illinois has suspended the use of nol carryforwards through  similar to the state of california s suspension of an nol deduction through for large corporations 
there can be no assurance that other states will not suspend the use of nol carryforwards or that california and illinois will not further suspend the use of nol carryforwards 
the current treatment of qualified dividend income and long term capital gains under current us federal income tax law may be adversely affected  changed or repealed in the future 
under current law  qualified dividend income and long term capital gains are taxed to non corporate investors at a maximum us federal income tax rate of 
this tax treatment may be adversely affected  changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time and is currently scheduled to expire for tax years beginning after december  this may affect market perceptions of our company and the market price of our llc interests could be negatively affected

our circumstances have changed over the intervening two years 
we have repaid all of our holding company debt and improved the financial condition of our operating businesses

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein 
we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses that provide basic services  such as chilled water for building cooling and gas utility services to businesses and individuals primarily in the us the businesses we own and operate are energy related businesses consisting of a interest in imtt  the gas company  and our controlling interest in district energy  and an aviation related business  atlantic aviation 
our infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with limited competition and significant barriers to entry  including high initial development and construction costs  the existence of long term contracts or the requirement to obtain government approvals and a lack of immediate cost efficient alternatives to the services provided 
overall they tend to generate sustainable long term cash flows 
distributions we believe we achieved prudent levels of cash reserves at both our holding company and operating companies 
in addition  our results of operations and balance sheet have improved sufficiently  along with improved capital market conditions  to give us confidence in our ability to refinance our debt on or before maturity 
as a result  we expect to declare a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of of per share to be paid during the second quarter of we currently expect to sustain this dividend for the foreseeable future 
in determining the amount of the dividend  we had expected to include certain funds from the cash flow of imtt 
distribution of funds to us from imtt is governed by the shareholders agreement between us and the co investor that owns the remaining stake 
the co investor has refused to vote in favor of distributing certain of these funds  and we believe that such a refusal violates the shareholders agreement 
as a result  we have formally initiated the dispute resolution process in the shareholders agreement  and intend to proceed to arbitration with the co investor if a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached within the timeframe prescribed in the shareholders agreement 
contingent upon the favorable outcome of the arbitration and the continued recovery of operating and capital market environments  we believe we could increase the quarterly dividend to as much as per share 
the precise timing and amount of any future distribution will be based on the continued stable performance of the company s businesses and the economic conditions prevailing at the time of any authorization 
management believes that any distribution would be characterized as a dividend for tax purposes rather than as a return of capital 
continuing operations our energy related businesses were largely resistant to the recent economic downturn  primarily due to the contracted or utility like nature of their revenues combined with the essential services they provide and the contractual or regulatory ability to pass through most cost increases to customers 
we believe these businesses are generally able to generate consistent cash flows throughout the business cycle 
the results of atlantic aviation have been negatively affected since mid by the slower economy and declining general aviation activity levels through mid however  general aviation activity levels stabilized in the second half of and showed year on year growth in december and through this stabilization  combined with expense reduction efforts  results in an improving outlook for the business 
we will continue to apply excess cash flow generated by atlantic aviation to the reduction of that business term loan principal  consistent with the amendments to the debt facility that we agreed to in february such repayments are expected to enhance our ability to successfully refinance this debt when it matures in discontinued operations pcaa bankruptcy on june   we concluded the sale in bankruptcy of an airport parking business parking company of america airports or pcaa  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  of which million related to the forgiveness of debt  and the elimination of million of current debt from liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet 
the results of operations from this business and the gain from the bankruptcy sale are separately reported as a discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
this business is no longer a reportable segment 
as a part of the bankruptcy sale process  substantially all of the cash proceeds were used to pay the creditors of this business and were not paid to us

as a result of this process  the business concluded that several of its sites did not have sufficient scale or serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these sites 
therefore  atlantic aviation has undertaken to exit certain markets and redeploy resources that may be made available in the process into markets which it views as having better growth profiles and recorded million in loss on disposal of assets in both the atlantic aviation and our consolidated statement of operations 
in  atlantic aviation bid for renewal of an operating lease at atlanta s hartsfield airport 
this lease had been operating on a month to month basis since being acquired by atlantic in august in november  the lease was tentatively awarded to a party other than atlantic 
as a result  in december  atlantic recorded a non cash loss on disposal of its assets totaling million 
as of february   atlantic aviation continues to operate at this fbo on a month to month basis  while the airport negotiates with the third party 
on january   atlantic aviation concluded the sale of fbos at fresno yosemite international airport and cleveland cuyahoga county airport 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the business recorded a non cash loss on disposal of its assets totaling million 
in february atlantic aviation entered into an asset purchase agreement pertaining to an fbo 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the business recorded a non cash loss on disposal of its assets totaling million 
this sale is pending as of this report date 
mic inc revolving credit facility until march   the company had a revolving credit facility provided by various financial institutions  including entities within the macquarie group 
the facility was repaid in full in december and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  or at the facility s maturity on march  this facility was not renewed or replaced 
we have no holding company debt 
income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes the taxable income of the gas company and atlantic aviation 
imtt and district energy file separate federal income tax returns 
distributions from imtt and district energy may be characterized as non taxable returns of capital  and reduce our tax basis in these companies  or as a taxable dividend 
we will include in our taxable income the taxable portion of any distributions from imtt and district energy characterized as a dividend 
such dividends are eligible for the dividend received deduction 
as a result of our having federal nol carryforwards  we do not expect to have consolidated regular federal taxable income or regular federal tax payments at least through the tax year 
the cash state and local taxes paid by our individual businesses are discussed in the sections entitled income taxes for each of our individual businesses 
tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of in december  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of the act was signed 
the act provides for bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service after september  and before january   and bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service during for federal income tax purposes 
importantly  illinois and louisiana  two states in which we have significant operations  do permit the use of bonus depreciation in calculating state taxable income 
generally  states do not allow this bonus depreciation deduction in determining state taxable income 
the company will take into consideration the benefits of these accelerated depreciation provisions of the act when evaluating our capital expenditure plans for and operating segments and businesses energy related businesses imtt imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through ten terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts  the great lakes region of the united states and partially owned terminals in quebec and newfoundland  canada 
imtt has its largest terminals in the strategic locations of new york harbor and the lower mississippi river near new orleans 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals  renewable fuels  and vegetable and animal oils and  based on storage capacity  operates one of the largest independent bulk liquid storage terminal businesses in the united states 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit include the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rental rates 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms between three and five years that require payment regardless of actual tank usage 
demand for storage capacity within a particular region eg new york harbor serves as the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates 
this demand for capacity reflects both the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals as well as import and export activity of such products 
we believe major constraints on increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets have been and will continue to be limited by availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand balance for bulk liquid storage currently exists in the markets serviced by imtt s major facilities 
this condition  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have allowed imtt to increase prices while maintaining high storage capacity utilization rates 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage charges for bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to prevent excessive viscosity and other revenue from blending  packaging and warehousing  etc most customer contracts include provisions for annual price increases based on inflation 
in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne facility  which services new york harbor  and approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  gretna  avondale and energy related businesses imtt continued geismar facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor 
imtt also owns oil mop  an environmental response and spill clean up business 
oil mop has a network of facilities along the us gulf coast between houston and new orleans 
these facilities service predominantly the gulf region  but also respond to spill events as needed throughout the united states and internationally 
in  oil mop was involved in the clean up of the spill in the gulf of mexico and contributed of total revenues 
this level of activity is not expected to recur in our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition  may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our equity in imtt s earnings and amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business 
the gas company the gas company is hawaii s only government franchised full service gas company  manufacturing and distributing gas products and services in hawaii 
the market includes hawaii s approximately million residents and approximately million visitors in the gas company manufactures synthetic natural gas  or sng  for its utility customers on oahu  and distributes liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg  to utility and non utility customers throughout the state s six primary islands 
the gas company has two primary businesses utility or regulated and non utility or unregulated 
the utility business serves approximately  customers through localized distribution systems located on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
the utility business includes the manufacture  distribution and sale of sng on the island of oahu and distribution and sale of lpg 
utility revenue consists principally of sales of sng and lpg 
the operating costs for the utility business include the cost of locally purchased feedstock  the cost of manufacturing sng from the feedstock  lpg purchase costs and the cost of distributing sng and lpg to customers 
utility sales comprised approximately of the gas company s total contribution margin in the non utility business sells and distributes lpg to approximately  customers 
trucks deliver lpg to individual tanks located on customer sites on oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
non utility revenue is generated primarily from the sale of lpg delivered to customers 
the operating costs for the non utility business include the cost of purchased lpg and the cost of distributing the lpg to customers 
non utility sales comprised approximately of the gas company s total contribution margin in sng and lpg have a wide number of commercial and residential applications  including water heating  drying  cooking  emergency power generation and tiki torches 
lpg is also used as a fuel for specialty vehicles such as forklifts 
gas customers include residential customers and a wide variety of commercial  hospitality  military  public sector and wholesale customers 
revenue is primarily a function of the volume of sng and lpg consumed by customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers 
because both sng and lpg are derived from crude oil  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel adjustment charges through which the changes in feedstock costs are passed through to customers 
evaluating the performance of this business based on contribution margin removes the volatility associated with fluctuations in the price of feedstock 
prices charged by the gas company to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hpuc utility rates that enable the business to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses and taxes  and capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital energy related businesses the gas company continued invested 
the gas company s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs through to customers via fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are based on the cost of lpg plus delivery costs  and on the cost of alternative fuels and competitive factors 
the gas company incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line   miles of distribution and service pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as for lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  generally fluctuate with the volume of product sold 
in addition  the business incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
district energy district energy consists of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us  respectively 
thermal chicago sells chilled water under long term contracts to approximately customers in downtown chicago and one customer outside of the downtown area 
under the long term contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received regardless of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are per unit charges for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for building cooling is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expense is electricity 
other direct expenses are water  labor  operations and maintenance and depreciation and accretion 
electricity usage  and to a lesser extent water usage  fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago focuses on minimizing the cost of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced by operating its plants to maximize efficient use of electricity 
other direct expenses are largely fixed regardless of the volumes of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide the majority of the business electricity in at a fixed price 
electricity for one of the plants is purchased by the landlord customer and the cost is passed through to the business 
thermal chicago passes through changes in electricity costs to its customers 
the business anticipates it will enter into supply contracts for and subsequent years and prices will fluctuate based on underlying power costs 
northwind aladdin services customers a hotel casino complex  a condominium and a shopping mall in las vegas  nevada 
under its customer contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per year thereafter through february aviation related business atlantic aviation the performance of atlantic aviation depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its gross profit 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic activity and demographic trends in the regions serviced by the airport at which the business operates and the general level of economic activity in the united states 
a number of these airports are located near key business centers such as new york  new york  chicago  illinois and philadelphia  pennsylvania as well as recreational destinations such as aspen  colorado and sun valley  idaho 
fuel gross profit is a function of the volume gallons sold and the average dollar margin per gallon 
the average price per gallon is based on our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities cost of revenue fuel  plus atlantic aviation s margin 
dollar based margins per gallon have been relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
the average dollar based margin varies based on business considerations and customer mix 
base tenants generally benefit from price discounts based on a higher utilization of atlantic aviation s networks 
transient customers typically pay a higher price 
atlantic aviation also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  atlantic aviation earns revenue from refueling some general aviation customers on a pass through basis  where it acts as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers 
atlantic aviation receives a fee for this service  generally calculated on a per gallon basis 
in addition  the business earns revenue from aircraft parking and hangar rental fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing 
at some sites where atlantic aviation operates an fbo business  it also earns revenue from refueling and de icing some commercial airlines on a fee for service basis 
expenses associated with non fuel revenue cost of revenue non fuel include de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel is directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increases in line with non fuel revenue in dollar terms 
atlantic aviation incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo 
operating expenses include rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature and other expenses  such as salaries  that generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  atlantic aviation incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 
results of operations consolidated key factors affecting operating results strong performance in our energy related businesses reflecting increase in revenue and gross profit from imtt spill response activity in the gulf coast  increases in average storage rates and storage capacity at imtt  increase in underlying margins at the gas company  and increase in gross profit at district energy driven by higher average temperatures and new customers 
improved contribution from atlantic aviation reflecting higher general aviation fuel volumes and margins  cost reductions  and lower interest expense as a result of the early repayment of the outstanding term loan debt  partially offset by a decrease in non fuel revenue 
results of operations consolidated continued our consolidated results of operations are as follows year ended december  change from to favorable unfavorable change from to favorable unfavorable in thousands unaudited revenue revenue from product sales revenue from product sales utility service revenue financing and equipment lease income total revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of product sales utility cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative fees to manager related party goodwill impairment  nm  depreciation amortization of intangibles loss on disposal of assets  nm total operating expenses operating income loss  nm  nm other income expense interest income interest expense equity in earnings and amortization charges of investees   nm loss on derivative instruments  nm  nm other income expense  net nm net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  nm  net income loss less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to mic llc nm not meaningful reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
interest expense includes non cash losses on derivative instruments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations consolidated continued gross profit consolidated gross profit increased from to reflecting improved results at our energy related businesses and for fuel related services at atlantic aviation  offset by a decrease in non fuel gross profit from atlantic aviation 
the decrease in our consolidated gross profit from to was due to a decline in fuel volumes at atlantic aviation  partially offset by improved results at our consolidated energy related businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased at all of our consolidated businesses  especially at atlantic aviation 
the decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily a result of cost reduction efforts at atlantic aviation  partially offset by higher costs at the holding company mainly attributable to the sale of the noncontrolling stake in district energy and increased incentive compensation  pension expense and professional services at our consolidated energy related businesses 
fees to manager base management fees to our manager increased due to increased market capitalization 
our manager elected to reinvest its first quarter base management fees in additional llc interests  which were issued to our manager during the second quarter of the base management fee for the second and third quarters of was paid in cash to our manager during the second half of our manager has elected to reinvest its fourth quarter base management fee of million in llc interests  which will be issued during the first quarter of base management fees to our manager decreased in due to decreased market capitalization 
our manager elected to reinvest the base management fees for the second  third and fourth quarters of in additional llc interests 
llc interests for the second and third quarters of were issued to our manager during the second half of llc interests for the fourth quarter of were issued to our manager during the first quarter of goodwill impairment during the first six months of and the fourth quarter of  we recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  at atlantic aviation 
there were no impairment charges in depreciation depreciation includes non cash asset impairment charges of million during the first six months of and million during the fourth quarter of  recorded at atlantic aviation 
excluding these impairment charges  depreciation expense increased each year as a result of capital expenditures by our businesses resulting in higher asset balances 
there were no impairment charges in amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense includes non cash asset impairment charges of million during the first six months of and million during the fourth quarter of  recorded by atlantic aviation 
the impairments reduced the amortizable balance 
there were no impairment charges in results of operations consolidated continued loss on disposal of assets during  atlantic aviation completed a strategic review of its portfolio of fbos 
as a result of this process  the business concluded that several of its sites did not have sufficient scale or serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these sites 
therefore  atlantic aviation has undertaken to exit certain markets and redeploy resources that may be made available in the process into markets which it views as having better growth profiles and recorded million in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest expense and loss on derivative instruments interest expense includes non cash losses on derivative instruments of million and million for and  respectively 
the change in the non cash losses on derivatives recorded both in interest expense and in loss on derivative instruments is attributable to the change in fair value of interest rate swaps  interest rate swap break fees related to the pay down of debt at atlantic aviation and includes the reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings  as atlantic aviation paid down its debt more quickly than anticipated 
excluding the portion related to non cash losses on derivatives  interest expense decreased due to a million reduction of term loan debt at atlantic aviation and the repayment in the full amount of the outstanding balance of million of mic holding company debt during december interest expense increased from to primarily at atlantic aviation due to payments of interest rate swap breakage fees 
given the downward movement in interest rates since the interest rate swap contracts were put in place  this business pays interest rate swap breakage fees as it pays down its term loan debt 
this increase was partially offset by the favorable libor movements on unhedged debt during the year  primarily the mic inc revolving credit facility  which was repaid in december equity in earnings and amortization charges of investees our equity in the earnings of imtt increased from to reflecting our share of the improved operating results of the business  offset by our share of non cash derivative losses of million for compared with our share of non cash derivative gains of million 
our equity in the earnings of imtt increased from to due to improved operating results of the business for that period  together with our share of the non cash derivative gains of million compared with our share of non cash derivative losses of million in income taxes for  we expect to report a consolidated net operating loss  for which we will record a deferred tax benefit  and we do not expect to pay a federal alternative minimum tax for further  we expect taxable income for to include a capital loss of approximately million on the disposal of our airport parking business  which we will carryback to accordingly  our consolidated taxable income will be reduced to approximately million 
for  we reported consolidated federal taxable income of million  which was offset by a portion of our consolidated federal nol carryforward 
for  we paid a federal alternative minimum tax of for  we reported consolidated federal taxable loss of million  for which we recorded a deferred tax benefit 
the benefit recorded in was net of certain state nols and a portion of our impairments attributable to non deductible goodwill

these businesses file separate consolidated income tax returns  and we include results of operations consolidated continued the dividends received from imtt and district energy in our consolidated income tax return 
further  we expect that any dividends from imtt and district energy in will be treated as taxable dividends  which qualify for the dividends received deduction drd 
valuation allowance as discussed in note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions  from the date of sale of the noncontrolling interest in district energy and onwards  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets without taking into consideration the deferred tax liabilities of district energy 
as of december   our valuation allowance was approximately million 
during we reduced the valuation allowance to approximately million  resulting in a net decrease of million 
of this decrease  million has been recorded as part of the benefit for federal and state income taxes included in continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining million of the decrease is included in net income from discontinued operations 
in calculating our consolidated state income tax provision  we have provided a valuation allowance for certain state income tax nol carryforwards  the utilization of which is not assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
in addition  we expect to incur certain expenses that will not be deductible in determining state taxable income 
accordingly  these expenses have also been excluded in determining our state income tax expense 
discontinued operations on june   we concluded the sale in bankruptcy of pcaa  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  of which million related to the forgiveness of debt 
the results of operations from this business and the gain from the bankruptcy sale are separately reported as a discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and prior comparable periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation

ebitda excluding non cash items is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and noncash items  which includes impairments  derivative gains and losses and adjustments for other non cash items reflected in the statements of operations 
we believe ebitda excluding non cash items provides additional insight into the performance of our operating businesses relative to each other and similar businesses without regard to their capital structure  and their ability to service or reduce debt  fund capital expenditures and or support distributions to the holding company 
we also disclose free cash flow  as defined by us  as a means of assessing the amount of cash generated by our businesses and supplementing other information provided in accordance with gaap 
we define free cash flow as cash from operating activities  less maintenance capital expenditures and changes in working capital 
working capital movements are excluded on the basis that these are largely timing differences in payables and receivables  and are therefore not reflective of our ability to generate cash 
we believe that reporting free cash flow will provide our investors with additional insight into our ability to deploy cash  as gaap metrics such as net income and cash from operating activities do not reflect all of the items that our management considers in estimating the amount of cash generated by our operating results of operations consolidated continued entities 
in this annual report on form k  we have disclosed free cash flow for our consolidated results and for each of our operating segments 
we note that free cash flow does not fully reflect our ability to freely deploy generated cash  as it does not reflect required payments to be made on our indebtedness  pay dividends and other fixed obligations or the other cash items excluded when calculating free cash flow 
we also note that free cash flow may be calculated in a different manner by other companies  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
therefore  our free cash flow should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of our financial results reported under gaap

interest expense  net  includes non cash gains losses on derivative instruments and non cash amortization of deferred financing fees 
energy related businesses imtt continued year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results environmental response service revenue and gross profit increased principally due to spill response work and other activities related to the oil spill in the gulf of mexico  and terminal revenue and gross profit increased principally due to increases in average tank rental rates  and increase in volume of storage under contract 
revenue and gross profit the increase in terminal revenue primarily reflects growth in storage revenue 
storage revenue grew due to an increase in average rental rates of during the year and an increase in storage capacity mainly attributable to certain expansion projects at imtt s louisiana facilities 
capacity utilization was essentially flat at during compared with in utilization rates were lower in the second half of  primarily due to tanks being taken out of service for inspection and repairs and maintenance 
many of these tanks were returned to service in early  however  cleaning and inspection activity is anticipated to remain at elevated levels through imtt expects utilization rates to be approximately to during terminal operating costs increased during the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and wages and higher repairs and maintenance 
revenue and gross profit from environmental response services increased substantially during primarily due to the increase in spill response activities following the april  bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
the business has substantially reduced its clean up efforts in the gulf relating to the bp spill and anticipates that oil mop s contribution to revenue and gross profit in will be materially less than general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year increased primarily due to the increase in environmental response services activity compared with the prior comparable period 
the increase reflects a year to date million increase from the environmental response service business  primarily related to cash and accrued bonuses and sales commissions 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased as imtt completed several major expansion projects  resulting in higher asset balances 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  includes non cash losses on derivative instruments of million in and non cash gains of million in excluding the non cash losses gains on derivative instruments  interest expense is higher due to increased rates on the revolving credit facility  an increase in the notional value of the hedged portion of the revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees associated with the additional issuance of gulf opportunity zone bonds  partially offset by a lower outstanding amount on the revolving credit facility 
energy related businesses imtt continued cash interest paid was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes the business files a consolidated federal income tax return and files a separate state income tax return in six states 
for the year ended december   the business paid state income taxes of approximately million 
for the year ended december   imtt recorded million of current federal income tax expense and million of current state income tax expense 
at december   imtt had a federal net operating loss of million  of which million was carriedback to and used in year and million was carriedforward to and was fully utilized in a significant difference between imtt s book and federal taxable income relates to depreciation of terminalling fixed assets 
for book purposes  these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over to years using the straight line method of depreciation 
for federal income tax purposes  these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over to years using accelerated methods 
most terminalling fixed assets placed in service in qualify for the federal or bonus depreciation  except assets placed in service in louisiana financed with go zone bonds 
a significant portion of louisiana terminalling fixed assets constructed since hurricane katrina are or will be financed with go zone bonds 
go zone bond financed assets are depreciated primarily over to years using the straight line depreciation method 
most of the states in which the business operates do not allow the use of the federal bonus depreciation calculation methods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results terminal revenue and terminal gross profit increased principally due to increases in average tank rental rates and volume of storage under contract  and increases in revenue from the provision of storage and other services with the full year of operations at imtt s geismar storage facility 
lower environmental response gross profit due to reduced spill activity in revenue and gross profit the increase in terminal revenue primarily reflects growth in storage and other services revenues  partially offset by declines in throughput and heating revenues 
storage revenue grew primarily as average rental rates increased by during the year 
the increase in storage revenue also reflected an increase in storage capacity mainly attributable to certain expansion projects at imtt s louisiana facilities 
gross profit increased primarily due to an increase in storage revenues and million of additional revenue as a result of a full year of storage and related logistics services at imtt s geismar terminal  which was partially offset by a customer reimbursement for capital projects completed at bayonne in which did not recur 
throughput and heating revenues declined reflecting lower activity levels at imtt s facilities and lower heating costs due to the decline in fuel prices passed through to customers 
storage capacity utilization  defined as storage capacity rented divided by total capacity available  remained relatively constant at and during and  respectively 
energy related businesses imtt continued the terminal operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased health insurance claims  pension costs  salaries and wages  pipeline related work and a full year of operations at geismar  partially offset by a million excise tax settlement in the first half of that did not recur in gross profit from environmental services decreased from to primarily due to higher spill response activity in relating to imtt s central role in response activities following the july  fuel oil spill on the mississippi river near new orleans 
general and administrative expenses lower general and administrative costs during resulted primarily from the recovery of receivables that had been fully provisioned for in prior periods and reserves under bad debt expense in that did not recur in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased as imtt completed several major expansion projects  resulting in higher asset balances 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  includes non cash gains on derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  excluding the non cash gains on derivative instruments  interest expense is higher due to higher borrowings to fund growth capital expenditures along with the discontinuation of the capitalization of construction period interest upon the commencement of operations at geismar  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on unhedged debt balances

year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results utility rate increase effective june   and effective non utility margin management 
although the presentation and analysis of contribution margin is a non gaap performance measure  management believes that it is meaningful to understanding the business performance under both a utility rate structure and a non utility competitive pricing structure 
regulation of the utility portion of the gas company s operations provides for the pass through of increases or decreases in feedstock costs to utility customers 
changes in the cost of propane distributed to non utility customers can be recovered in pricing  subject to competitive conditions generally 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to revenue  gross profit  operating income  or net income  determined in accordance with us gaap 
a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit is presented in the above table 
the business calculates contribution margin as revenue less direct costs of revenue other than production and transmission and distribution costs 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently or may use different metrics and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for the gas company is not necessarily comparable with metrics of other companies 
contribution margin and operating income utility contribution margin was higher for due to implementation of a rate increase from june   partially offset by the timing of fuel adjustment charge reconciliations  higher gas hauling and transportation costs and the implementation of the final rate case order 
the volume of gas products sold for was relatively flat compared with the gas company renegotiated its synthetic natural gas  or sng  feedstock contract with tesoro during the contract is subject to approval by the hawaii public utilities commission hpuc that is expected by mid the gas company expects that the changes in cost of feedstock will be passed through to consumers via the fuel adjustment charge mechanism and will have no impact on utility contribution margin 
non utility contribution margin was higher for as a result of effective margin management 
the volume of gas products sold in was approximately higher than the gas company renegotiated its liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg  supply contracts which are expected to increase the amount of locally supplied propane 
in the fourth quarter  chevron had an unexpected shut down  which impacted the business local supplies  requiring the business to procure higher priced foreign sources of lpg 
production  transmission and distribution and selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of labor related expenses and professional fees 
on a combined basis  these costs were higher than primarily due to higher salary and electricity costs  mostly offset by capitalized labor costs

year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results increased utility contribution margin due to an interim rate increase implemented from june   increased non utility contribution margin resulting from new business processes that improved the business ability to acquire and price the non utility lpg  partially offset by a marginal reduction in volumes 
contribution margin and operating income utility contribution margin was higher  primarily due to implementation of the interim rate increase from june   partially offset by volume declines related almost entirely to commercial customers  who are more exposed to the variability of the economic cycle 
the volume of gas sold in was approximately lower than non utility contribution margin was higher  primarily due to lower input costs  partially offset by a volume decline from selling  general and administrative costs increased due to an approximate  increase in pension expense  higher incentive compensation based upon strong performance and professional service costs primarily related to the implementation of a profit center structure in interest expense  net interest expense  net  includes non cash losses on derivative instruments of  for excluding the non cash losses on derivative instruments  interest expense decreased  primarily due to a lower weighted average annual interest rate on the business primary facilities due to the basis swap agreement entered into in march cash interest paid was million and million for and  respectively 
income taxes when preparing its income tax returns  the gas company elected to change its method of tax accounting for certain repair expenditures that were previously capitalized and depreciated in determining both book and taxable income 
this change reduced current federal and state taxable income by approximately million  of which million was attributable to the  and the balance attributable to the tax write off of expenditures capitalized in prior years

gross profit gross profit increased primarily due to warmer average temperatures during the second and third quarters of compared with the comparable period in resulting in higher ton hour sales 
additionally  cooling capacity revenue increased due to a net increase in contracted capacity provided to new customers that began service predominantly in the second quarter of  and annual inflation related increases of contract capacity rates in accordance with customer contract terms

year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results higher general aviation ga fuel volumes and higher weighted average ga fuel margins  lower selling  general and administrative expenses due to ongoing expense reduction initiatives  and lower interest expense driven by reduced debt levels  partially offset by a decrease in other non fuel revenue primarily driven by lower landing fees and miscellaneous fixed based operations related services 
revenue and gross profit the majority of the revenue and gross profit in atlantic aviation is generated through fueling ga aircrafts at airports and one heliport in the us revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel used to service these aircraft 
if our business owns the fuel  it records the cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
the business corresponding fuel revenue is its cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
the business generally pursues a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  dollar based margins  thereby passing any increase in fuel prices to the customer 
atlantic aviation also has into plane arrangements whereby it fuels aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
it collects a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue also includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing  landing fees  tie down fees and miscellaneous services 
the business fuel related revenue and gross profit are driven by fuel volume and dollar based margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
customers will sometimes move from one category to the other 
the business believes discussing total fuel related revenue and gross profit  including both fuel sales and into plane arrangements as recorded in the non fuel revenue line and related key metrics on an aggregate basis  provides a more meaningful analysis of atlantic aviation 
in  the business derived of total gross profit from fuel and fuel related services 
in  atlantic aviation derived from these services 
gross profit for increased compared with as a result of an increase in aggregate fuel related gross profit  offset by lower gross profit from other services 
the increase in aggregate fuel related gross profit resulted from a increase in ga fuel volume  driven by increased business jet traffic 
the full year ga fuel volume increase reflects volume growth in the first nine months of the year and relatively flat volume in the fourth quarter as a result of weaker fuel sales to military customers 
weighted average fuel margin increased by compared with the previous year 
margins started to increase in the third quarter and expanded at an accelerated rate in the fourth quarter 
aviation related business atlantic aviation continued the year on year change in fuel related gross profit includes a number of events which will not reoccur in any given year  such as the g meeting in pittsburgh in and the temporary closure of the runway at rifle airport in excluding such events  ga fuel volume would have increased  and weighted average fuel related margin would have remained flat in margin contraction in the first half of the year was offset by margin expansion in the second half of the year 
on the same basis  gross profit from other services would have decreased for the year ended december  gross profit from other services decreased by for the quarter ended december  compared with the fourth quarter in the decrease in other services gross profit mainly reflects non recurring revenue recorded at a location in december selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to due to the ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a one time increase of million to the bad debt reserve in the first quarter of due to the deterioration of the accounts receivable aging 
accounts receivables aging improved significantly since the first quarter of no further adjustment to the bad debt reserve was necessary in subsequent periods as a result of continued improvement in the aging of accounts receivables 
excluding this one time adjustment in  the underlying selling  general and administrative expenses would have decreased by a in atlantic aviation expects selling  general and administrative expense to be less than million for goodwill impairment in addition to its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter  the business performed an impairment test at the reporting unit level during the first six months of goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
based on the testing performed  the business recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the first six months of there were no impairment charges in depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to non cash impairment charges of million incurred in the first half of there were no impairment charges in loss on disposal of assets during  atlantic aviation completed a strategic review of its portfolio of fbos 
as a result of this process  the business concluded that several of its sites did not have sufficient scale or serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these sites 
therefore  atlantic aviation has undertaken to exit certain markets and redeploy resources that may be made available in the process into markets which it views as having better growth profiles and recorded million in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of operations

the business files state income tax returns in more than states in which it operates 
the tax expense in the table above includes both state taxes and the portion of the consolidated federal tax liability attributable to the business 
while atlantic aviation as a whole expects to generate a current year federal income tax loss  certain entities within the business will generate state taxable income 
for the year ended december   the business expects to pay state income taxes of approximately million 
the business has approximately million of state nol carryforwards 
state nol carryforwards are specific to the state in which the nol was generated and various states impose limitations on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
therefore  the business may incur state income tax liabilities in the near future  even if its consolidated state taxable income is less than million 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results lower ga fuel volumes and essentially flat weighted average fuel margins  higher interest expense related to interest rate swap break fee costs associated with prepayment of debt during  partially offset by lower compensation expense resulting from staff rationalization and decreased credit card fees stemming from lower jet fuel prices and lower activity levels 
revenue and gross profit gross profit for declined compared with mainly due to lower volume of ga fuel sold 
fuel volumes declined as compared with weighted average margins  including into plane sales  were essentially flat 
excluding the results from the charter operations and management contracts business  which were sold in the second half of  gross profit from other services including hangar rentals  de icing and miscellaneous services decreased by for the year  primarily due to lower hangar rentals resulting from lower transient traffic

gross profit for the fourth quarter of is sequentially flat compared with the third quarter of as de icing revenue  higher fuel volume and miscellaneous fbo services were offset by lower weighted average fuel margins resulting from customer mix 
ga fuel volume increased as compared with third quarter of as business jet traffic at atlantic aviation s fbos improved 
aviation related business atlantic aviation continued selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to integration synergies and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives 
these cost savings were offset by a million increase in the bad debt reserve in the first quarter of due to the deterioration of the accounts receivables aging 
account receivables aging improved significantly since the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended december  declined compared with the fourth quarter of as a result of cost reduction initiatives 
operating cost sequentially increased by reflecting typical seasonality of the business driven by increase utilities expense  repairs and maintenance expense and overtime expense related to snow removal 
goodwill impairment in addition to its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter  the business performed an impairment test at the reporting unit level during the first six months of goodwill is considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  as determined under a two step approach 
based on the testing performed  the business recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the first six months of and million in the fourth quarter of  respectively

the current state income tax expense in was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated our primary cash requirements include normal operating expenses  debt service  debt principal payments  payments of dividends and maintenance capital expenditures 
our primary source of cash is operating activities  although we may borrow against existing credit facilities for growth capital expenditures  issue additional llc interests or sell assets to generate cash 
we believe we achieved prudent levels of cash reserves at both our holding company and operating companies 
in addition  our results of operations and balance sheet have improved sufficiently  along with improved capital market conditions  to give us confidence in our ability to refinance our debt on or before maturity 
as a result  we expect to declare a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of of per share to be paid during the second quarter of we currently expect to sustain this dividend for the foreseeable future 
in determining the amount of the dividend  we had expected to include certain funds from the cash flow of imtt 
distribution of funds to us from imtt is governed by the shareholders agreement between us and the co investor that owns the remaining stake 
the co investor has refused to vote in favor of distributing certain of these funds  and we believe that such a refusal violates the shareholders agreement 
as a result  we have formally initiated the dispute resolution process in the shareholders agreement  and intend to proceed to arbitration with the co investor if a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached within the timeframe prescribed in the shareholders agreement 
contingent upon the favorable outcome of the arbitration and the continued recovery of operating and capital market environments  we believe we could increase the quarterly dividend to as much as per share 
the precise timing and amount of any future distribution will be based on the continued stable performance of the company s businesses and the economic conditions prevailing at the time of any authorization 
management believes that any distribution would be characterized as a dividend for tax purposes rather than as a return of capital 
we believe that our operating businesses will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet future requirements  including servicing long term debt obligations and making distribution payments 
we base our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources on the following assumptions our businesses and investments overall generate  and we expect will continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available financing  all significant short term growth capital expenditures will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn credit facilities  and we will be able to refinance  extend and or repay the principal amount of maturing long term debt on terms that can be supported by our businesses 
we have capitalized our businesses  in part  using project finance style debt 
project finance style debt is limited recourse  floating rate  non amortizing debt with a medium term maturity of between five and seven liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued years  although the principal balance on the term loan debt at atlantic aviation is being prepaid using the excess cash generated by the business 
at december   the average remaining maturity of the drawn balances of the primary debt facilities across all of our businesses  including our proportional interest in the revolving credit facility of imtt  was approximately years 
in light of the improvement in the functioning of the credit markets generally  and the leverage and interest coverage ratios  we expect each of these businesses to successfully refinance their long term debt on economically reasonable terms on or before maturity 
until march   mic inc had a revolving credit facility provided by various financial institutions  including entities within the macquarie group 
the facility was repaid in full in december and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  or at the facility s maturity on march  this facility was not renewed or replaced 
we have no holding company debt

the debt facilities  which are obligations of the operating businesses and have maturities between and  are subject to certain covenants  the violation of which could result in acceleration of the maturity dates 
capital lease obligations are for the lease of certain transportation equipment 
such equipment could be subject to repossession upon violation of the terms of the lease agreements 
this represents the minimum annual rentals required to be paid under non cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
the gas company currently has a time charter arrangement for the use of two barges for transporting liquefied petroleum gas between oahu and its neighbor islands 
the above table does not reflect certain long term obligations  such as deferred taxes  for which we are unable to estimate the period in which the obligation will be incurred 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued in addition to these commitments and contingencies  we typically incur capital expenditures on a regular basis to maintain our existing revenue producing assets in good working order maintenance capital expenditures  and expand our existing revenue producing assets or acquire new ones growth capital expenditures 
see investing activities below for further discussion of capital expenditures 
we also have other contingencies  including pending threatened legal and administrative proceedings that are not reflected above as amounts at this time are not ascertainable

analysis of consolidated historical cash flows from continuing operations year ended december  change from to favorable unfavorable change from to favorable unfavorable in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities  nm  cash used in provided by financing activities   nm nm not meaningful operating activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities comprises primarily the cash from operations of the businesses we own  as described in each of the business discussions below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid at the holding company  including base management fees paid in cash  professional fees and interest incurred in the prior periods on any amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
the increase in consolidated cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to improved operating performance at atlantic aviation due to stable gross profit and cost savings  lower interest paid on the reduced term loan balance for atlantic aviation and no interest paid on holding company debt  a larger dividend received from imtt  and improved operating results at the consolidated energy related businesses 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued the decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities from to was due primarily to lower operating performance at atlantic aviation  and payment of interest rate swap breakage fees relating to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on atlantic aviation s term loan debt  partially offset by lower interest paid on the reduced term loan balance for atlantic aviation  reduced levels of working capital  reflecting decreased activities combined with receivable collection efforts at atlantic aviation  and improved operating results at the gas company 
distributions from imtt are reflected in our consolidated cash provided by operating activities only up to our share of imtt s positive earnings 
amounts in excess of this  and any distributions when imtt records a net loss  are reflected in our consolidated cash from investing activities as a return of investment in unconsolidated business 
for  million in distributions were included in cash from operating activities compared with million in in  million of the million dividends received were included in cash from operating activities and million were included in cash from investing activities 
we believe our operating activities overall provide a source of sustainable and stable cash flows over the long term with the opportunity for future growth due to consistent customer demand driven by the basic nature of the services provided  our strong competitive position due to factors including high initial development and construction costs  difficulty in obtaining suitable land near many of our operations for example  airports  waterfront near ports  long term concessions contracts  required government approvals  which may be difficult or time consuming to obtain  lack of cost efficient alternatives to the services we provide in the foreseeable future  and product service pricing that we expect to generally keep pace with price changes due to factors including consistent demand  limited alternatives  contractual terms  and regulatory rate setting 
investing activities the increase in consolidated cash used in investing activities from to was primarily due to cash received from the sale of the noncontrolling stake in district energy in  and higher capital expenditures at the gas company  partially offset by lower capital expenditures at district energy in  and cash received in from the pcaa bankruptcy estate for expenses paid on behalf of pcaa during its operations 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued the decrease in consolidated cash used in investing activities from to was primarily due to the absence of acquisition activity in  cash received from the sale of the noncontrolling stake in district energy in compared with the sale of two small  non core businesses at atlantic aviation in  lower capital expenditures at atlantic aviation and the gas company  partially offset by cash retained by imtt to fund growth capital expenditures during  and increase in capital expenditures at district energy in for the expansion of a new plant 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities in our consolidated cash flows has been acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments  and the sale of the noncontrolling stake in district energy 
the other main driver is capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures generally have been funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or by equity capital 
we may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time 
we expect that our growth capital expenditures will generally be yield accretive once placed in service 
acquisitions of businesses are generally funded on a long term basis through raising additional equity capital and or project financing style credit facilities 
on december   with the cash received from the sale of the noncontrolling interest in district energy  and cash on hand  we paid off the outstanding principal balance of the facility 
in december  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of the act was signed 
the act provides for bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service after september  and before january   and bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service during for federal income tax purposes 
generally  states do not allow this bonus depreciation deduction in determining state taxable income 
importantly  illinois and louisiana  two states in which we have significant operations  do permit the use of bonus depreciation in calculating state taxable income 
we will take into consideration the benefits of these accelerated depreciation provisions of the act when evaluating our capital expenditure plans for and financing activities the decrease in consolidated cash used in financing activities from to was primarily due to higher debt repayment during at atlantic aviation  and full repayment of the mic inc revolving credit facility during  partially offset by debt draw downs at district energy and the gas company to fund capital expenditures during  full repayment on the gas company working capital facility during  and distributions paid to the noncontrolling interest at district energy 
the increase in consolidated cash used in financing activities from to was primarily due to debt repayment during at atlantic aviation  debt draw downs in  primarily against the mic inc revolving credit facility  to fund acquisitions  and full repayment of the mic inc revolving credit facility  partially offset by the suspension of distributions to shareholders in  and the increase in debt draw downs at district energy to fund capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued the primary drivers of cash provided by financing activities are equity offerings  debt financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures  the subsequent refinancing of our businesses and the repayment of the outstanding principal balance on maturing debt 
a smaller portion of cash provided by financing activities relates to principal payments on capital leases 
for  we expect to apply substantially all excess cash flows from atlantic aviation to prepay the debt principal under the amended terms of the credit facility 
actual prepayment amounts through the maturity of the facility will depend on the operating performance of the business 
our businesses are capitalized with a mix of equity and project financing style debt 
we believe we can prudently maintain relatively high levels of leverage due to the generally sustainable and stable long term cash flows our businesses have provided in the past and which we currently expect to continue in the future as discussed above 
our project finance debt is non amortizing and we expect to be able to refinance the outstanding balances of the term loan on or before maturity  except at atlantic aviation  where all excess cash flow from the business is being used to prepay the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
similarly  excess cash flow generated at district energy will be applied toward the principal balance of the term loan during the last two years before maturity

ebitda definition excludes i all extraordinary or non recurring non cash income or losses during the relevant period including losses resulting from write off of goodwill or other assets  and ii any non cash income or losses due to change in market value of the hedging agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
these estimates and policies are consistent with the estimates and accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the gas company  district energy and atlantic aviation include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared with its corresponding carrying value 
the gas company  district energy and atlantic aviation are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks  which are not amortized  requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks are less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment is initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our atlantic aviation business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
we test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
impairments of goodwill  property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements and intangible assets during and relating to atlantic aviation  are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in part ii  item revenue recognition the gas company recognizes revenue when the services are provided 
sales of gas to customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis 
most revenue is based upon consumption  however  certain revenue is based upon a flat rate 
district energy recognizes revenue from cooling capacity and consumption at the time of performance of service 
cash received from customers for services to be provided in the future are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected services period on a straight line basis 
fuel revenue from atlantic aviation is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
atlantic aviation also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided 
hedging we have in place variable rate debt 
management believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments 
to meet this objective  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on a majority of its debt with a variable rate component 
as of february  for atlantic aviation and effective april  for our other businesses  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting 
from the dates that hedge accounting was discontinued  all movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded directly through earnings 
as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting  we will reclassify into earnings net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of the existing interest rate swaps 
our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value of interest rate swaps recorded directly through earnings 
we measure derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach  which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value 
see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the borrowings of our businesses 
our current policy is to enter into derivative financial instruments to fix variable rate interest payments covering at least half of the interest rate risk associated with the borrowings of our businesses  subject to the requirements of our lenders 
as of december   we had billion of current and long term debt for our consolidated continuing operations  billion of which was economically hedged with interest rate swaps and million of which was unhedged 
imtt at december   imtt had two issues of new jersey economic development authority tax exempt revenue bonds outstanding with a total balance of million where the interest rate is reset daily by tender 
a increase in interest rates on this tax exempt debt would result in a  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through this tax exempt debt has been hedged from october through november through the use of a million face value of libor swap 
as this interest rate swap is fixed against of day libor and not the daily tax exempt tender rate  it does not result in a perfect hedge for short term rates on tax exempt debt although it will largely offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of this interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  and a corresponding relative increase would result in a  increase in the fair market value 
at december   imtt had issued million in gulf opportunity zone bonds go zone bonds to fund qualified project costs at its st 
rose  gretna and geismar storage facilities 
a increase in interest rates on the outstanding go zone bonds would result in a million increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through the go zone bonds has been partially hedged until june through the use of an interest rate swap which has a notional value of million 
as the interest rate swap is fixed against of the day libor rate and not the tax exempt tender rate  it does not result in a perfect hedge for short term rates on tax exempt debt although it will largely offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of million and a corresponding relative increase would result in a million increase in the fair market value 
on december   imtt had million outstanding under its usd revolving credit facility which includes million associated with the usd dnb loan 
a increase in interest rates on this debt would result in a  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes on its us revolving credit facility has been partially hedged against day libor from october through march through the use of an interest rate swap which has a notional value of million as of december  which increases to million on december  and million from december  to maturity 
if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of million and a corresponding relative increase would result in a million increase in the fair market value 
before the usd dnb loan was incorporated into the usd revolving credit facility  its interest was hedged through a swap with a notional value that matched the original amortization schedule of the loan 
from december  to maturity at december   the notional value of the swap is fixed at million 
this hedging arrangement will partially offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
however  if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  a corresponding relative increase in interest rates would result in a  increase in the fair market value of the interest rate swap 
on december   imtt had million outstanding under its canadian revolving credit facility 
a increase in interest rates on this debt would result in a  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
the gas company the senior term debt for the gas company and hgc comprise two non amortizing term facilities totaling million and a senior secured revolving credit facility totaling million 
at december   the entire million in term debt had been drawn 
these variable rate facilities mature on june  a increase in the interest rate on the gas company and hgc s term debt would result in a million increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in annual interest cost 
the gas company and hgc s exposure to interest rate changes for the term facilities has  however  been fully hedged from september  until maturity through interest rate swaps 
these derivative hedging arrangements will offset any interest rate increases or decreases during the term of the notes  resulting in stable interest rates of for the gas company rising to in years and of the facility and for hgc rising to in years and of the facility 
a relative decrease in market interest rates from december  levels would decrease the fair market value of the hedge instruments by  a corresponding relative increase would increase their fair market value by  the gas company also has a million revolver of which no amount was outstanding at december  district energy district energy has a million floating rate term loan facility maturing in a increase in the interest rate on the million district energy debt would result in a million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
district energy s exposure to interest rate changes through the term loan facility has been fully hedged to maturity through the use of interest rate swaps 
these hedging arrangements will offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of district energy s hedge instruments will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the hedge instruments of approximately million 
a corresponding relative increase would result in an approximately million increase in the fair market value 
district energy also has a million capital expenditure loan facility which was fully drawn at december  a increase in the interest rate on district energy s capital expenditure loan facility would result in a  increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in annual interest cost 
atlantic aviation as of december   the outstanding balance of the floating rate senior debt for atlantic aviation was million 
a increase in the interest rate on atlantic aviation s debt would result in an million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in an million decrease in interest cost per year 
the exposure of the term loan portion of the senior debt which at december  was million to interest rate changes has been hedged until october through the use of interest rate swaps 
these hedging arrangements will offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates during that period 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of our hedge instruments will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the hedge instruments of million 
a corresponding relative increase would result in a million increase in the fair market value
