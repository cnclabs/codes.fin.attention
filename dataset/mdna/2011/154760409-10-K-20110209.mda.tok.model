executive overview fiscal was another challenging year in our company s history 
our high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans both in hawaii and on the mainland contributed to substantial credit losses and has significantly weakened our financial condition 
our previous focus on these higher yielding assets allowed us to realize greater returns in years when the economy was performing well 
however  because there are inherent risks associated with this type of lending  our credit risk profile was significantly higher than other financial institutions with more balanced asset mixes 
as a result  the downturn in the national and local economies that started in the second half of and continued into  and specifically the deterioration in the commercial real estate sector  had a significantly more adverse impact on our operating results than many other banks across the nation 
during  we reported a net loss of million  primarily due to continued high levels of non performing assets requiring sizable loan loss provisions and a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the remaining goodwill associated with our hawaii market reporting unit 
our land acquisition  development  construction  and commercial real estate portfolios have shown particular weakness 
while the deterioration in our asset quality started with our mainland loan portfolio during the second half of  our hawaii portfolio has also suffered significant losses and credit weakness over the past two years 
adding to our challenges were the frb agreement entered into with the frbsf and dfi and the consent order with the fdic and dfi  all of which resulted in additional regulatory supervision of our operations and financial condition 
in addition  we expect to be subject to the mou by the end of february in march  we implemented a recovery plan designed to improve the company s financial health and capital ratios
