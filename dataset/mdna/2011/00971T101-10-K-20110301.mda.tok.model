item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
in recent years  however  we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly  annual or longer periods 
our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions that our existing customers purchase 
at the same time  we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality  price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures that may be announced after the date hereof 
recent event on january   our board of directors elected pamela l 
craig as a director on the board  effective on april  overview of financial results our increase in net income in as compared to and reflects the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth

table of contents we were profitable for fiscal years  and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future during each quarter of  we were able to offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase 
a continuation of this trend  in conjunction with increased revenues from non recurring revenue contracts  could lead to increased revenues  however  any such increased revenues could be offset if lower traffic reduces the revenues we earn on a non committed basis or as a result of declines in the prices we charge 
during each quarter of  unit prices offered to some new and existing customers declined  primarily as a result of increased competition from new and established competitors that are willing to use low unit prices as a method of differentiation 
these price reductions primarily impacted customers  for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network  such as digital media customers 
budgetary constraints facing our customers due to current economic conditions also contributed to pricing pressure on certain services 
if we continue to experience decreases in unit prices for new and existing customers and we are unable to offset such reductions with increased traffic over our network  our revenues and profit margins could decrease 
historically  we have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly revenues attributable to e commerce services used by our retail customers  with higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the summer months 
if this trend continues  our ability to generate quarterly revenue growth on a sequential basis could be impacted 
during each quarter of  we reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers 
additionally  we continued to invest in internal use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network 
due to the increased traffic delivered over our network  our total bandwidth costs increased during each quarter of as compared to the same quarters in we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  total network bandwidth costs could increase more than expected in during each quarter of  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we expect that customer concentration levels will continue to decline compared to those in prior years if our customer base continues to grow 
during the year ended december   revenues derived from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues 
for  we anticipate revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be consistent with for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect that stock based compensation expense will increase  as we continue to grant restricted stock units to employees  partially offset by a slight reduction in stock based compensation from employee stock options as they become fully vested 
as of december   our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock based awards were million  which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of years 
this expense is expected to be recognized through depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal use software development costs increased by million during as compared to due to expected future purchases of network equipment during  we believe that depreciation expense related to 
table of contents our network equipment will continue to increase in we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings and capitalize stock based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects  which would increase the amount of capitalized internal use software costs 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will be higher in as compared to in november  we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors pursuant to which we were granted a put option to sell the ars we held at july  back to such investment advisor 
in july  we exercised this put option  and the investment advisor repurchased million of our ars holdings at par value 
as of december   we held million in par value of ars 
based upon our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of  million at december  and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business during we believe we have the ability to hold these ars until a recovery of the auction process  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or until maturity 
during the year ended december   our effective income tax rate was 
we expect our annual effective income tax rate in to remain relatively consistent with  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with the accounting guidance for stock based compensation or any tax planning strategies 
in  due to our continued utilization of available net operating losses  or nols  and tax credit carryforwards  our tax payments were significantly lower than our recorded income tax provision 
we expect to utilize substantially all of our tax credit carryforwards in once we have done so  the amount of cash tax payments we make will increase over those made in previous years 
based on our analysis of  among other things  the aforementioned trends and events  as of the date of this annual report on form k  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during  however  our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through recurring revenue contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network as well as increased sales of our value added solutions  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including generating positive net income  in any future period 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities  capitalized internal use software costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  tax reserves  impairment and useful lives of long lived assets  loss contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition  including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly  quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly  quarterly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month  provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated 
the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 
when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement  we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for each respective element  including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer 
for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe  third party evidence  or tpe  of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor 
for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element  we use the best estimate of selling price  or besp  to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables 
we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we 
table of contents record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be objectively established 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  deferred integration and activation set up fees  and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 
valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities effective january   we implemented a then newly required accounting standard related to fair value measurement for our financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least 
table of contents annually 
the guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities that have been classified as level  or within the fair value hierarchy as described in the fair value measurement guidance 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
included in our long term marketable securities at december  are auction rate securities  or ars  that are primarily aaa rated bonds  which are all collateralized by federally guaranteed student loans 
at december   our short and long term marketable securities included ars 
ars are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that may reset through a dutch auction process that is designed to occur every seven to days 
historically  the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates 
beginning in mid february and continuing throughout the period ended december   however  the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful 
as a result  the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements 
we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or the securities mature 
in light of these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december  assumed a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of five years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaa rated ars market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  as of december   we have estimated an aggregate pre tax loss of million which was related to the impairment of ars not deemed to be other than temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
despite the failed auctions  we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars 
in addition we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the ars prior to a recovery of par value and currently intend to hold the investments until such time because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities on hand and from projected cash flows from operations 
see liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
as of december  and  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december  and we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of completed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability  but we disclose the nature of these loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 
we currently have net deferred tax assets  comprised of nol carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

table of contents uncertainty in income taxes are recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock based compensation awards including stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and deferred stock units 
related to such awards  we measure the fair value at the grant date and we recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
in addition  for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions  we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved 
changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 
for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and deferred stock units that contain only a service based vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
for awards with a performance condition based vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the awards expected vesting period  commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs  as well as stock based compensation expense  of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to  million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years 
we expect this trend to continue in but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and a leveling off of the rate of increased growth in use of the internet 
as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to  at december  and  at december  
table of contents a significant portion of the increase in revenues for as compared to was driven by traffic growth from our customers in our media and entertainment vertical 
revenues from this traffic growth were partially offset by reduced prices charged to our customers 
the increase in revenues from our commerce and enterprise customers for as compared to was principally due to increased purchases of value added services 
in our high tech vertical  we experienced an increase in traffic growth as well as an increase in demand for our application performance solution services 
the increase in revenues from public sector customers was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and government contracts 
growth in our commerce vertical contributed to a large portion of our revenue growth for as compared to this was attributable to our acquisition of acerno and its advertising services customer base in late  our new advertising decision solutions service offering contributed million to such revenue growth 
the balance of the increased revenues from our commerce customers  as well as enterprise customers  was principally due to increased purchases of value added services such as our application performance solution services 
the increase in revenues from customers in our high tech vertical was primarily driven by increases in the amount of traffic we delivered 
while we also experienced increased traffic from customers in our media and entertainment vertical  the revenues from this traffic growth were offset by reduced prices charged to our customers 
the increase in revenues from public sector customers was primarily attributed to the addition of new customers 
the following table quantifies the contribution to growth in revenues from different industry verticals in which we sell our services in millions for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  as compared to media entertainment commerce enterprise high tech public sector total net increase for  and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which  and of total revenues for  and  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
other than the united states  no single country accounted for or more of our total revenues during these periods 
we expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in to remain consistent as compared to resellers accounted for of total revenues in  in and in for  and  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services  and amortization of internal use software 

table of contents cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions for the years ended december  bandwidth and service related fees co location fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel stock based compensation  including amortization of prior capitalized amounts depreciation and impairment of network equipment amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in each instance  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit  an increase in co location costs as we deployed more servers  and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 
additionally  in each of  and  cost of revenues included stock based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock based compensation  such expense increased by million in as compared to and million in as compared to cost of revenues during each of  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  are unpredictable 
we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
as of december  our current minimum commitments for the years ending december     and were approximately million  million  million   and  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in as compared to we expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and co location fees  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  for  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for research and development personnel who design  develop  test  deploy and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  net of impairments 
these development costs consisted of external consulting  payroll and payroll related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
additionally  for the years ended december   and  we capitalized as internal use software million  million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation 
we amortize these capitalized internal use software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

table of contents research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stock based compensation  partially offset by higher capitalized salaries 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was also due to increases in payroll and related costs  partially offset by higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation capitalized salaries and other total net increase we believe that research and development expenses will increase in as compared to because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology  develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel  attributable to revenue growth and an increase in stock based compensation  marketing and related costs and an increase in other expenses  such as travel costs  which was partially offset by a reduction in training and conference costs

amortization of other intangible assets remained consistent at million for each of the years ended december  and amortization of other intangible assets increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in as compared to was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of acerno in november based on current circumstances  amortization expense is expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december     and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decreases in as compared to and in as compared to were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods

interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense remained consistent at million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our convertible senior notes 
the decrease in interest expense in resulted from the conversion of common stock of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible notes 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest bearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred  gains from legal settlements  and other non operating expense income items

other income  net for the year ended december  consisted of million of gains on legal settlements and million of gains on divesture of certain assets  offset by million of foreign exchange losses 
other income  net for the year ended december  consisted mostly of foreign exchange gains 
other expense income  net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates  the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 
gain loss on investments  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on investments of million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities 
additionally  during we recorded a gain of million due to a decrease in the other than temporary impairment of certain ars and a loss of million on a put option related to our ars holdings 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on investments of million  which primarily related to an unrealized gain of million from a decrease in the other than temporary impairment of certain marketable securities and an unrealized loss of million on a put option related to our ars holdings 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on investments of million  which reflects a loss of million due to other than temporary impairments on certain marketable securities  a gain of million realized on a put option related to our ars received from one of our investment advisors in november  and a gain of million on the sale of marketable securities 

table of contents loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million as a result of early conversions of million in principal of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate of was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefit recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by the state income taxes 
for the years ended december  and december   our effective tax rates of and  respectively  were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
provision for income taxes remained consistent at million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the slight decrease from to was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate  offset by an increase in operating income 
the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in our operating income 
while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in to remain relatively consistent with  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stock based compensation or any potential tax planning strategies 
our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 
further  our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter  due to items arising from discrete events  including settlements of tax audits and assessments  the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 
in  due to our continued utilization of available nols and tax credit carryforwards  our tax payments were significantly lower than our recorded income tax provision 
we expect to utilize substantially all of our tax credit carryforwards in once we have done so  the amount of cash tax payments we make will increase over those made in previous years 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 
non gaap measures in addition to the traditional financial measurements that are reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap  we also compile and monitor certain non gaap financial measures related to the performance of our business 
we typically discuss the non gaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 

table of contents we believe that making available the non gaap financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects  especially when comparing such results to previous periods  forecasts or competitors financial statements 
our management uses these non gaap measures  in addition to gaap financial measures  as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors 
these measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision making 
we consider fully taxed normalized net income and fully taxed normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are non cash 
we define fully taxed normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding the following pre tax items amortization of other acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  stock based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal use software  restructuring charges and benefits  acquisition related costs benefits  certain gains and losses on investments and loss on early extinguishment of debt

beginning in  we no longer include utilization of tax nols credits in determining our non gaap net income due to the expectation of fully utilizing most of our nols and tax credit carryforwards in we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of our operational strength and the performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend

liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities  proceeds from exercise of stock awards and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which consisted of corporate debt securities  united states treasury and government agency securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and student loan backed ars  totaled  million 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
we held approximately million and million in par value of ars at december  and  respectively 
ars are primarily aaa rated bonds  most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education 
none of the ars in our portfolio are mortgage backed or collateralized debt obligations 
in mid february  all of our ars experienced failed auctions  which failures continued throughout the period ended december  as a result  we have been unable to liquidate most of our holdings of ars 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in or in the foreseeable future 
in november  we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors that provided for the repurchase  beginning on june   of all of the ars we purchased through such financial advisor if we have been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such securities before that time 
in early july  we exercised our put right under the agreement  and the investment advisor repurchased million of ars at par value 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as compared the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense  offset by an increase in working capital  an increase in our excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions 
current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates

table of contents changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt and equity repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events

in january  the line of credit was approved by the investment advisor 
in early july  we exercised our put right under the agreement  and the investment advisor repurchased million of ars at the par value 
the unused letter of credit has expired 
we believe  based on our present business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change  if we are unable to liquidate our marketable securities  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
we may not  however  be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders

we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in we are not  however  able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
letters of credit as of december   we had outstanding million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries  primarily related to facility leases 
approximately million and  of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities and are classified as short term and long term marketable securities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet at december  the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit 
these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through august the remaining million of irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology 
generally  these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance provides an alternative method for establishing the selling price for a deliverable 
when vsoe or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop an estimate of the selling price for separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
we have elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after january  to date  we have been able to determine the selling price for each element in multiple element arrangements based on vsoe for each respective element 
specifically  the selling price is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately or based on the renewal rate for services contractually offered to the customer 
as a result  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition  the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not expected to have a significant effect on revenues in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on current go to market strategies due to the existence of vsoe across our service offerings 
in october  the fasb issued an accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this standard amends previously issued guidance to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
entities that sell joint hardware and software products that meet the exception will be required to follow the guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application are also permitted 
we have elected to early adopt this guidance beginning january  as a result  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard update for business combinations specifically related to the disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this guidance specifies that pro forma disclosures should be reported as if the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period and the pro forma disclosures must include a description of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
this standard will be effective for business combinations with an acquisition date of january  or later 
the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
at december   we held million in par value of ars that have experienced failed auctions  which has prevented us from liquidating those investments 
due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
such analysis considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december  assumed a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of five years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for recent debt offerings 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  as of december   we have estimated an aggregate pre tax loss of million  which related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
the impact for the year ended december  was a pre tax gain of million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity related to ars having impairments deemed to be temporary 
the aggregate gain in the fair value of ars experienced in the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used in the computation of fair values from used as of december  to used as of december  our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if  as of december   we had used a term of three years or seven years and discount rate of  the gross unrealized loss on the million in par value of ars classified as available for sale would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of five years and discount rate of or  the gross unrealized loss on the million in par value of ars classified as available for sale would have been million or million  respectively 
during november  we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors providing for it to repurchase the ars held through such advisor at par value beginning on june  if we were unable to liquidate such ars before that date 
the ars covered by this agreement had a par value of million at june  at any time during the period up until june  our investment advisor could have called the ars at par value but did not do so 
in early july  we exercised the put option incorporated in the agreement  and the investment advisor repurchased million of our ars holdings at par value 
we elected to apply the fair value option permitted under the relevant accounting standard to the put option 
the fair value of the put option was determined by comparing the fair values of the related ars  as described above  to their par values and also considered the credit risk associated with our investment advisor 
as of december   the fair value of the put option was million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million  which offset the related ars gain of million  included in gain loss on investments  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have operations in europe  asia  australia and india 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
additionally  we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts
