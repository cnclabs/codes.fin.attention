item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting  and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements  and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
on june   we acquired the banking operations of mirae bank from the fdic  who had been named receiver of the institution 
we acquired approximately million in assets and assumed million in liabilities 
this included million in loans  and million in deposits in addition to five branch offices 
the integration of former mirae was successfully completed in the third quarter of  during which out of the branches were merged as a result of their close proximity to our existing office locations 
even with the branch mergers  the retention rate for former mirae deposit customers remained high 
over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty three branch offices and five lpos 
we believe that our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue implementing our growth strategy using strategic planning and market analysis  as our needs and resources permit 
in december  we issued  shares of newly designated series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  and an attached warrant exercisable initially for  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share  to the us treasury in exchange for the us treasury million investment in the tarp capital purchase program 
this additional capital infusion from the united states government further strengthened our capital ratios  allowing us to continue to assist the financial markets with much needed liquidity via careful lending to qualified borrowers 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on 
table of contents commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio  and enhanced our shareholders value 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business geographically by focusing on the continued development of the east coast market 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our operations during our total assets decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of our total deposits decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of our total loans decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of total net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million in  or an increase of from million in the increase in net interest income was a result of decrease in deposit  fhlb advances  and other borrowing expenses 
provision for loan losses was increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
total noninterest income decreased to million in  a decrease of from million in a large portion of the decrease is attributable to a gain of million as a result of the mirae bank acquisition that was recorded to noninterest income in not including the gain from the acquisition  noninterest income increased by 
total noninterest expense increased to million in or from million in the increase is mainly due to an increase in legal fees  and expense related to oreo and low income housing tax credit investments 
net income available for common shareholders for decreased to a loss of million or per basic and diluted common share  compared with net income of million  or per basic and diluted common share in the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to higher than expected provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments in compared to  provisions increased by million to million in the increase in provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments is a result of credit quality issues and management actions to address these credit concerns as quickly as possible through note sales  charge offs  modifications  and resolutions with customers 
outlook although the economic indicators point towards modest growth and economic expansion in  we will continue to take a cautious approach on our outlook for as a result of downturns in the commercial and residential real estate market  asset quality on cre loans contributed to our higher delinquency and non accrual rates in we expect this trend to continue in consequently  management has begun acquiring updated appraisals on cre loan collateral and stress testing cre loans during we believe the commercial real estate market may face increased deterioration  although not at the level experienced in and in addition  the internal investigation conducted by the company revealed some deficiencies in the company loan underwriting  origination and renewal procedures 
as a result  the company is  among 
table of contents other things  implementing enhanced underwriting policies and shifting its focus from marketing and growth to credit quality control 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  and has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions  and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates  and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of sba loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimates necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in notes and of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report under asc  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale 
table of contents securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to market prices obtained from an independent external pricing service provider 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
we perform an analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we ensure whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
impairments related to credit issued must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process involving assessment of valuation and changes in such valuations resulting from deteriorating credit worthiness 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent  and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note and of our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented later in this report 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb asc which was previously emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets  and eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
 we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
we consider factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored enterprises gse bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obligations cdos that had previously been rated aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the 
table of contents intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
we do not intend to sell the municipal bonds and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis as of december  with regard to the company investment in debt securities available for sale or held to maturity  no events have occurred and no facts have been discovered with respect to such investment that would indicate an other than temporary impairment of the investment value 
small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loans among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip  or i o strip  receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset was amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
on january   we adopted asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  and selected a fair value measurement method to measure our servicing assets and liabilities and recognized a onetime increase in their fair value of  net of tax effects 
any subsequent increase or decrease in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair values  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the 
table of contents estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimate of probable losses in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with asc sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with asc we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors listed below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if information exists to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio 
the factors currently considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credit  delinquency trend  nature and volume of loan trend  non accrual and problem loan trends  loss and recovery trend  quality loan review  lending and management staff  lending policies and procedures  and external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each factor 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower financial capacity in conjunction with industry 
table of contents and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
held for sale loans pursuant to asc a long lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria are met  a 
management has authority to approve and commit to selling the asset b 
the asset is immediately available for sale c 
a plan to sell has been completed including actively locating buyers d 
the sale probable within year and is expected to qualify as a sale e 
the asset is actively being marketed for sale at a reasonably price f 
the plan to sell indicates it is unlikely that significant change to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn 
if the company has the intention to sell a note and if all of the criteria above are met  then the loan is be categorized as held for sale as of the date the decision is made 
once classified as held for sale  the loan is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value 
provisions and reserves are recorded to reflect a decline in fair value if the fair value is less than the loan carrying amount 
any subsequence decline or increase in fair value for held for sale loans are accounted for as an increase or decrease in valuation allowance for held for sale loans which directly affects earnings 
when a classified as held for sale  the discount or premium is not amortized  but interest and expenses related to the note continue to be accrued 
loans transferred to held for sale continue to be recorded the same past due and nonaccrual treatment as other loans  if necessary 
once a loan has been sold  the difference between the purchase price and the fair value is measured against net income as a gain or loss on sale of loans 
valuation of other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the estimated fair value less the selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo 
table of contents property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york  and from the mirae bank acquisition 
as of december  goodwill stood unchanged from the previous year at million  all of which is related to the liberty bank acquisition located in the east coast 
million and million  respectively  in core deposits intangibles were recorded as a result of the liberty bank and mirae bank acquisition 
core deposit intangibles had cost bases of  and  related to the liberty bank and mirae bank transaction  respectively 
in accordance with asc previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
our impairment analysis of goodwill is calculated in accordance with asc using a combination of the market approach and income approach 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of december  and found no impairment adjustment was needed as the fair value calculation significantly exceeds the carry value of equity 
income taxes we accounted for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carry forwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date is not considered necessary  because it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
our effective tax rates were often lower than the statutory rates 
this was mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of bank owned life insurance and low income housing tax credit funds 
in  we adopted the provision of fasb asc formerly financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 which is now codification reference  income taxes 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based 
table of contents on the technical merits 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  in as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  and related interest was  sba guaranteed loan sales in december  fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting for transfers of financial assets  to codify fasb statement is revision to statement no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
codified at asc  the guidance requires more information about transfer of financial assets  including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
the statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
as of january  implementation date  the guidance has changed the company categorization of sba guaranteed portions of loans sold to third parties purchasers 
due to the following recourse provisions  sales accounting will not be applied to these transactions if borrower makes the first three payments required by the note after the warranty date the date the agreement is settled by the bank and registered holder through fta in which they are due and the payments are the full amounts required by the note  the bank has no liability to refund the premium 
if the borrower prepays the loan for any reason within the days of the warranty date  the bank must refund any premium received 
if the bank fails to make the first three monthly payments due after the warranty date and the borrower enters uncured default within calendar days from the warranty date  the bank shall refund any premium received 
borrower payments must be received by the bank in the month in which they are due and must be full payments as defined in the borrower note 
if a transfer of a portion of a loan does not meet the participation definition  the transfer is treated as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral 
prior to the issuance of this statement  sba guaranteed portions sold to third parties were treated as loans before and after the sale of the loan as sales accounting treatment was applied 
however under the new guidance  we now classify sba guaranteed portions of loans as secured borrowings 
as a result of the new guidance  the recognition of gain on sale of sba guaranteed loans will be delayed by at least days until the recourse provision expires  and during that period  the loan balances will be grossed up and payment received will be accounted for as secured borrowings 
starting february  all guaranteed portions of sba loans sold will not have any warranty or recourse periods 
the small business administration made changes to the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans that effectively removes any recourse provision thereby immediately qualifying any loans sold after february  as a sales transaction 
loans sold after january  and before february  will still not be treated as a sales transaction until all recourse provisions expire  until which the sold loans will continue to be accounted for as secured borrowings 

table of contents results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
our average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits also increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing in from billion in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing by in from billion in the federal reserve board rate decrease in resulted in a decline in our average yield on interest earning assets to in from in since the last rate reduction on december   the current federal funds rate has been to  an unprecedentedly low level and has remained without change throughout and in addition  loan interest income reversals due to non accrual loans has increased in  therefore the average yield on interest earning assets again decreased to in during the same time periods  the rates for deposits in our local markets remained competitive  which required us to closely monitor our cost of funds so that it would be in line with our yield on assets 
total interest income declined in to million  down from million in which was an increase of from million in interest expense meanwhile has continued to decline  decreasing to million in  as compared with million in which was a decrease of from million in the combined result of our growth particularly in core deposits  and careful monitoring efforts with respect to cost of funds resulted in an increase in our net interest income 
net interest income before provision for losses on loan and loan commitments increased  or million  to million in  following an increase of  or million in to million from million in as a result of our lowered cost of funds in  our net interest spread increased from in to in and to in net interest margin increased to in from in but was down from in

loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but include those placed on non accrual status 
provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments in anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business and the recent ongoing financial crisis  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were made not only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
although we have enhanced our stringent loan underwriting standards and proactive credit follow up procedures  we experienced a substantial increase of the provision for loan losses because of a weak economy  the continued decline in the real estate market  and increases in loan defaults and foreclosures 
due to aggressive resolution of problem loans through reserves and charge offs in  our provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase in provision for loan losses in was a result of an investigation in regarding misconduct by a loan officer in addition to a lack of supervision and

the remaining increases in our provisions were primarily due to an increase of non performing loans see nonperforming assets below for further discussion 
total charge offs in totaled million in compared to million in  and increase of million 
the increase in charge offs from to is largely attributable to note sale transactions  in which discount portions of loan sold were charged off 
the million provision in was net of provision of million to the reserve for loan commitments  while the million and million in provisions in and included million in provisions for loan commitments and  in recoveries for loan commitments  respectively 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
noninterest income was of average assets in  a decrease from in but an increase from in we currently earn noninterest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount gain from acquisition of mirae bank service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of securities gain on sale of loans loan related servicing fees other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was the gain relating to the acquisition of mirae bank  which represented of total noninterest income 
there were no gains on acquisition recorded in or the million acquisition gain was recorded as a bargain purchase gain which resulted from the difference between the total fair value of assets acquired in the amount of million  less million in fair value of liabilities acquired from the second quarter acquisition of mirae bank 
our services charges on deposits accounted for of total noninterest income  which was the largest portion of noninterest income in and decreased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in services charges on deposits in was primarily due to deposit declines in  specifically a decline in non sufficient 
table of contents funds fees 
we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive edge in our markets 
our liquidity position continued to remain strong in and as a result of strong deposit growth particularly core deposits in the past 
this  in addition to slower loan demand allowed us to profit from gains on the sale of securities 
gains from security sales totaled million in  our second largest source of noninterest income at of total noninterest income 
the million in securities gains in was down from million in but a large increased from gain on sale of securities which totaled  the market value of securities have increased in and in contrast to what we experience in and due to decreased volatility in markets  changes in the yield curve  and contraction of interest rates spreads on securities owned by the bank 
gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of our total noninterest income in was our next largest source of noninterest income 
gain on sale of loans increased from million in to million in and again increased to million in this noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in the secondary market for government securities and retain the associated servicing rights 
due to the weakened economy and ongoing financial crisis  our sba loan production levels decreased to million in as compared with million in however  production levels increased in to million which contributed to the increase in gain on sale of loans 
gains from the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans were million at the end of and million at  and million for there were no gains from unguaranteed portions sold from to the sale of mortgage loans resulted in gains totaling  in   in  and  in although there were not losses on sale of loans in or  we recorded a loss on sale of loans totaling  in our fourth largest source of noninterest income was loan related servicing fees  which represented approximately of our total noninterest income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
with the expansion of our trade financing activities and the growth of our servicing loan portfolio  fee income has generally increased 
in  loan related servicing fees increased to million  as compared with million in and million in the servicing fee income on sold loans is credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing rights and interest only  or i o strips that we originally capitalized upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing rights and i o strips are also charged against the loan service fee income account when the sold loans are paid off 
income on other earning assets represents dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in the cash surrender value of boli 
these accounted for   and million in   and  respectively 
other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as loan referral fees  sba loan packaging fees  gain on sale of investment securities and excess of insurance proceeds over carrying value of an insured loss that generally increases as our business grows 
other income decreased to million in  as compared with million in  and million in noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in the increases in and were primarily attributable to the increased fdic and state assessments  and increase in premises expense related to opening of new branches  as well increases stemming from balance sheet growth 
in  noninterest expenses were increased due to increased legal fees and loss on sale of oreo both related to the increase in problem loans in addition to increased salaries and wages 
due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses during our expansion  we were able to maintain noninterest expenses as a

these increases were attributable to the expansion of our office network and the additional office space and lease expenses for our new california and new york branch offices opened in and 
table of contents professional fees generally increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we expand our business operations 
professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
professional fees increased by million from to as a result of an increase in legal fees totaling million 
approximately  of that increase was due to an investigation regarding misconduct by a former employee of the bank 
legal fees were increased as a result of credit issues and use of legal professionals in the resolution and sales of non performing loans 
the  increase in was attributable to the  increase in accounting  audit fees and an increase of  in legal fees related to loan collection  property foreclosure and repossession  and various other legal consultations  and a  increase in fees related to consulting  system test  and various accounting and auditing services 
deposit insurance premium expenses represent the financing corporation fico and fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  these expenses decreased to million from million in and million in the increase in fdic insurance assessment in was primarily a result of the temporary increase in fdic insurance coverage from  to  starting may this increased the insured deposit amount thereby increasing assessment fees associated with covered deposits 
the fdic also levied a special assessment starting june amounting to basis points 
deposit insurance premiums decreased  in compared to due to the decrease in deposits for the same period 
data processing expenses decreased to million in compared to million in  and decreased from million in the increase in data processing in corresponded to the growth of our business as a result of the acquisition of mirae bank 
one time costs associated with the acquisition were expensed in as well 
data processing fees were decreased in due to the absence of further one time costs in addition to the streamlining of mirae bank data 
loss on investment in low income housing tax credit lihtc investments  representing of total noninterest expenses  totaled million in  compared with no related expense in and the company uses equity method when accounting for partnership interest 
the loss is related to current period losses allocated from the equity method in loss on the sale of other real estate owned or oreo increased from  in to million or of noninterest expense in  an increase of 
there were no losses recorded related to the sale of oreo in the increase in loss of sale of oreo was a result of an increase in problem loans that were converted to oreo in this increase and the cost associated with the sale of oreo resulted in an increase of million in  when compared to advertising and promotional expenses increased to million in from million in  which previously increased from million in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in the new areas such as the east coast market in new york and new jersey 
the expenses have remained fairly steady with no large fluctuations from to outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due mainly to the increase in service activities and the increase in depositors demanding such services  our outsourced service costs generally rise in proportion with our business growth 
nonetheless  with our successful cost control measures  these expenses decreased to million in  as compared with million in and million in 
table of contents other expense such as post retirement benefit costs  office supplies  and director fees individually all were under million and together totaled million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
all other noninterest expense  increased by million  or  to million in from million in during other noninterest expense increased million or from million in a portion of the increase represents a normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and was in line with our expectation 
however  approximately  was expensed in as a result of operational losses at our branches and in other loan expenses totaled  an increase of  from as a result of our cost control efforts  noninterest expense increased less rapidly at in compared to in our successful expansion into the new york new jersey market in the previous years has paved the groundwork for our further expansion into the east coast in and beyond 
although management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow  we remain committed to cost control and operational efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we had an income tax benefit million on pretax net loss of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate decreased from to  due primarily to an increase in low income housing tax credit funds  and lower taxable income 
our lower effective tax rates and higher income tax benefit rates compared to statutory rates were mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of boli and low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december    and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million  and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carry forwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date is not considered necessary  because it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
on january   we adopted the provisions of asc formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of applying the provisions of asc  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and no related interest 
as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  the adjustment was solely related to the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions 
we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 

table of contents as of the december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes 
accrued interest was included as part of our net deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements 
we file united states federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statues of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
examinations for the and tax years under the california franchise tax board were completed as of december   but we are still under examination by the new york state department of taxation and finance for the same period 
examinations for the and tax years under the california franchise tax board are ongoing as well 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect the examination results will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement as of december  financial condition investment portfolio investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a comprehensively written investment policy addressing strategies  categories  and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and is maintained a level management believes is appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested

we did not have any interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions as of december    or investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing a balanced interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risks 
as of december   our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of united states government agency securities  accounting for of the entire investment portfolio 
our us government agency securities holdings are all prime conforming mortgage backed securities  or mbs  and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc  or gnma 
gnmas are considered equivalent to us treasury securities  as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
currently  there are no subprime mortgages in our investment portfolio 
besides the us government agency securities  we also have a investment in corporate debt and in municipal debt securities

our investment portfolio does not contain any government sponsored enterprises  or gse  preferred securities or any distressed corporate securities that had required other than temporary impairment charges as of december  in accordance with asc recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  an other than temporary impairment otti is recognized if the fair value of a debt security is lower than the amortized cost and the debt security will be sold  it is more likely than not  that it will be required to sell the security before recovering the amortized cost  or if it is expected that not all of the amortized cost will be recovered 
credit related declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines related to factors aside from credit issues are reflected in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we classified our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale pursuant to asc sfas no 

we adopted asc sfas no

the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains and losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
credit related declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses  and there were no such other than temporary impairment in the fair market values of our held to maturity and available for sale securities were respectively  and million as of december

the million decrease in represented million net purchases and million unrealized gain 
meanwhile  the million increase in represented million net purchases  which includes million received as a result of the acquisition of mirae bank  and million unrealized gain 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our levels of liquidity using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds which are maintained mainly in the form of overnight investments 
the large decrease in was a result of increased liquidity that resulted from the inflow of core deposits

in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we performed detailed evaluation of the investment portfolio in assessing individual positions that have market values that have declined below cost 
in assessing whether there was other than temporary impairment  we considered in a disciplined manner whether or not all contractual cash flows due on a security will be collected  and our positive intent and ability to hold the debt security until recovery in fair value or maturity a number of factors are considered in the analysis  including but not limited to issuer credit rating  likelihood of the issuer default or bankruptcy  collateral underlying the security  industry in which the issuer operates  nature of the investment  severity and duration of the decline in fair value  and analysis of the average life and effective maturity of the security 
we do not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of december  represented an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our gse bonds  gse cmos  and gse mbs were attributable to both changes in interest rate us treasury curve and a repricing of risk spreads widening against risk fee rate in the market 
we do not own any non agency mbs or cmo 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities  or abs  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  that had previously been rated aaa aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing of risk in the market 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature

the exception was with sba loans  and it was our practice to resell these loans in the secondary market for the guaranteed portion with day recourse 
however  beginning march  the recourse provision for sba guaranteed portions sold was removed and no longer a standard for these transactions 
accordingly  we do not retain a significant amount of the credit risk exposure on the loans sold

real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses 
the properties may either be user owned or for investment purposes

restructured loans are loans of which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal 
other npas consist of properties  mainly other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed vehicles  acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
the treatment of nonperforming status for held for sale loans is the same for as other loans and are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 
our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of npls prior to however  the general economic condition of the us as well as the local economies in which we do business have shown a gradual decline as the housing sector and gdp growth continued to show weakness in and the effect of the unfavorable economy environment on the strength of our borrowers credit and financial status combined with deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to loan originations caused  and our npls  net of sba guaranteed portion  increased to million at the end of  as compared with million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
at december   the npls as a percentage of total loans was  increased from    and  in    and  respectively 
as of december   we had million as other npas  which comprised of eighteen oreos  with fifteen of those foreclosed in we have listed these properties for sale or are directly selling these properties as of december  among these eighteen oreos  we have recorded million in provisions for twelve of properties 
of the seven oreo sold in year  the bank recorded a loss of million 
at december   we had million as other npas  which was comprised of fifteen oreos  with nine of those foreclosed in we have listed the properties for sale as of december  among those fifteen oreos  we have recorded  provision for five of them 
of the seven oreo sold in year  bank recorded a gain of  at december   we had million as other npas  which was comprised of eight oreos  with seven of those foreclosed in we have listed the properties for sale as of december  among those eight oreos  we have recorded  provision for one of them  with a total value of  the oreo was subsequently sold in february for a small gain of  at the end of  the majority of our oreo was attributable to a single oreo valued at  which was foreclosed in the fourth quarter of at the end of  we had a different oreo  which was subsequently sold in january at a small loss 
together with oreo and repossessed vehicles  our ratio of npas as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets equaled     and as of december      and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for npas  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below for further discussion

additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded during the year ended december   if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  or  if not outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december   since origination 
during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to this loan was included in net income 
additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents allowance for loan losses and loan commitments based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for losses on loans and loan commitments is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments above 
the allowance for loan losses is made up of components  specific valuation allowance or sva allowance on impaired loans that are individually evaluated and general valuation allowance or gva loans that are evaluated as pools based on historical experience and also qualitative adjustments which are used to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
historical loss experience used to calculate gva may not accurately capture true credit losses and trends and therefore management performed a review of the historical loss rates used in gva as well as the qualitative adjustment qa methodology due to the increased significance of qa when estimating losses in the current economic environment 
to establish an adequate allowance  we must be able to recognize when loans have become a problem 
a risk grade of either pass  special mention  substandard  or doubtful  is assigned to every loan in the loan portfolio  with the exception of home mortgage loans and automobile loans  ie homogeneous loan 
the following is a brief description of the loan classification or risk grade used in our allowance calculation pass loans loan is not past due more than days with no credit deterioration 
the financial condition of the borrower is sound as well as the status of any collateral 
loans secured by cash principal and interest also fall within this classification 
special mention loans where there is evidence to suggest there is credit weakness with the potential for deterioration or loans with the potential to deteriorate with market conditions 
substandard loans were credit weakness exists and past due at greater than days 
source of repayment has been compromised and the potential for future losses or charge offs exist 
doubtful loans in which the collection of debt is unlikely and the possibility of a loss is high but not remote 
we currently use a migration analysis to determine allowance for loan losses and use software program to produce historical loss rates used in gva estimations 
a qa matrix is also used to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
for impaired loans  or sva allowance  we evaluates loans on an individual basis to determine impairment in accordance with general accepted accounting principles or gaap 
all these components are added together for a final allowance for loan losses figure on a quarterly basis 
net charge offs in increased to million compared to million in nonetheless  the net charge offs in were much higher compared to the previous years due to the large amount of note sales transactions in and the discovery of a material weakness in our internal controls related to loan originations and underwriting  in addition to the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a number of our clients 
the net charge offs in were comprised of million of real estate secured net loan charge offs  million of commercial and industrial loans net charge offs  and  of consumer loan net charge offs 
the million in net charge offs represents of average total loans in  as compared with    and  in   and  respectively 

table of contents in order to keep pace with the increase of npls and the size of our loan portfolio  we increased our allowance for loan losses by  or million  to million at december   as compared with million at december  before that  allowances were million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
with the continued increase of the allowance for loan losses and loan commitments in recent years  we were able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at     and at the end of     and  respectively 
although management believes our allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in further increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
information on impaired loans is listed in the following table for december  and december  at december  dollars in thousands with specific reserves without charge offs with charge offs without specific reserves without charge offs with charge offs allowance on impaired loans impaired loans net of allowance average impaired loans impaired loans at december  and december  had sba guarantee portion and discount on acquired loans totaling million and million  respectively

table of contents deposits and other sources of funds deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
total deposits at december    and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  in  and an increase of billion  or  in from the previous year 
the average deposits for the years ended december    and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the average total deposit balances increased or million in and or million in the increase in deposits in and is a result of the acquisition of mirae bank  the inflow of deposits from peer institutions  and the due to our expansion in the east coast region of our operations 
deposits acquired from mirae bank totaled million at the time of the acquisition in june as a result of the acquisition  we experienced a large inflow of deposits due to customers perception of our financial strength 
however  during the third and fourth quarter of we used our liquidity to reduce higher costing non core deposits letting them mature and not renewing at high rates and focused on increasing non interest bearing demand deposits 
this reduced overall deposits  but the effect has not yet been fully realized in averaged deposits for after  our niche market depositor preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts and we increased our reliance on time deposits to fund our loan growth 
due to our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits divided by average total deposits decreased to in from in and for the slight increase from to is due to growth in time deposits less than  which are considered as core deposits 
this trend was evident again in with jumbo time deposits time deposits with balances of  or greater continuing to decrease while other time deposits increased 
we will continue to promote our core deposit campaign in order to achieve the assigned core deposit goals and to reduce our level of time deposit reliance going forward

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of  or greater at december  are  as follows maturities of time deposits of  or more  at december  dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total because our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts  individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer oriented banks 
a number of clients carry deposit balances that were more than of our total deposits  but at december    and  the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
in addition to our regular customer base  we also accept brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
during  the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks within the markets where we do business has slightly driven up interest rates on various deposit products 
as a result  broker deposits have been lower in cost  as compared with other time deposits 
with our continued strength in liquidity  we were able to decrease these deposits to million at december  from million and million  at december  and  respectively  in order to improve our net interest margin and to limit our reliance on high interest rate time deposits 
all of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
we have historically utilized borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility and comparatively low cost 
due to the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks in our market  we have occasionally used fhlb borrowings as an alternative to fund our growing loan portfolio

on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with the new required capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until march  an extension of the previous effective date of march  as a result of continued economic pressures to come into compliance with the final rule capital restrictions due to the transition period 
therefore all bank holding companies may include cumulative  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities in tier capital up to the of total core capital 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp categorized all million trust preferred securities as tier capital 
asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
liquidity management liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee 
table of contents and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  and issuance of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as fdic tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary use of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash outflows from operating activities of million and net cash inflows of  and million  respectively 
in  net cash used by operating activities was primarily attributable to the subtraction of million origination of loan held for sale  and the addition of million proceeds from sale of loans held for sale and million provision for losses on loans and loan commitments 
other assets were also increased million and the company recorded a net loss of million  both factors contributing to outflow of cash for operating activities 
similarly in and  the net cash provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to the net income earned during the immediately preceding years and also to the originations and proceeds of loans held for sale 
net cash inflows from investing activities totaled million in  while and experienced net cash outflows of million and million  respectively 
during and net cash out flows were primarily related to the net increases in loans receivables and the purchase of investment securities available for sale for those years 
however  in  proceeds from investment pay downs  maturities  calls  and sales along with proceeds from the sale of other loans were the largest contributors to the cash provided by investing activities 
largest cash in flows for and were attributed to securities  cash from matured and sold securities 
net cash outflows from financing activities totaled million in and cash inflows from financing activities were million and million and  respectively 
the net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the decrease in deposits  which totaled million 
in however  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the increase in deposits totaling million 
cash provided by financing activities is attributable to the increase in fhlb borrowings  issuance of preferred stock  and also an increase in deposits 
net cash outflows from financing activities totaled million in and cash inflows from financing activities were million and million and  respectively 
the net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the decrease in deposits  which totaled million

for purpose of having liquid cash available for emergencies  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december    and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was   and at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in liquid assets in is a result of management planned reduction of high cost deposits in the third and fourth quarter funded by the proceeds from cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from investment securities pay downs  maturities  calls  and sales 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with 
table of contents various corresponding banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
among all these sources  we prefer advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution net worth or on the fhlb assessment of the institution creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we limit our use to of our borrowing capacity  as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to a combined million in federal funds through lines with three correspondent banks 
borrowing capacity at the frb discount window stood at million  with million in securities pledged at december  it is management belief that our liquidity is sufficient to meet the company short term and long term cash flow needs as they arise 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
when the us treasury made tarp funds available to financial institutions in october  our board of directors decided to take advantage of this opportunity and increased our capital by participating in the program 
in december  we received a tarp investment from the us treasury in the amount of million 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 

table of contents as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

at december   as the result of issuance of the series a preferred stock in december  the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million million tarp preferred stock and million trust preferred securities  decreasing the portion for tier capital to million 
for the bank level  only the million debenture issued by the bank in is treated as tier capital

recent accounting pronouncements in january  fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu will require reporting entities to make new disclosures about a amounts and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  b input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level and c information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measures 
the new and revised disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll 
table of contents forward of activity in level fair value measures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu effective for reporting periods after december  did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statement 
in april  fasb issued asu effect of a loan modification when the loan is part of a pool that is accounted for as a single asset  which is effective for modifications of loans accounted for within pools under subtopic occurring in the first interim or annual period ending after july  under the amendments  modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool do not result in the removal of those loans from the pool even if the modification of those loans would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring 
an entity will continue to be required to consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statement 
in july  fasb issued asu disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses to improve disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
companies will be required to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements  such as aging information and credit quality indicators 
both new and existing disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment or class 
the disaggregation of information is based on how a company develops its allowance for credit losses and how it manages its credit exposure 
required disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for periods ending on or after december   while required disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for periods beginning on or after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statement 
fasb asu  receivable topic  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses asu requires new and enhanced disclosures about the credit quality of an entity financing receivables and its allowance for credit losses 
the new and amended disclosure requirements focus on such areas as nonaccrual and past due financing receivables  allowance for credit losses related to financing receivables  impaired loans  credit quality information and modifications 
the asu requires an entity to disaggregate new and existing disclosures based on how it develops its allowance for credit losses and how it manages credit exposures 
for public entities  the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  see note in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu affects all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
asu modifies step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning 
table of contents after december  adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us through its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management alm committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  our alm committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
because these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alm committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet 
table of contents instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alm policy prescribes that for the worst possible rate decreasing scenario the possible reduction of net interest income and npv should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv  respectively 
in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans and investments  decrease in interest rates would result the increase of net interest margin and npv 
increase in interest rates would be expected to have opposite effect 
however  given in the record low interest rate environment  further decrease in interest rate will result in net interest margin as shown in our simulation measures below 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns
