a reading of each section is important to understand fully the nature of our financial performance and prospects 
executive overview financial performance review in  we reported net income of million  or per common share see table 
the current year included a nonrecurring reduction of per common share for the deemed dividend resulting from the repurchase of billion in tarp capital 
this compared with a net loss of  million  or per common share  for the loss primarily reflected two items  million in noncash goodwill impairment charges and  million in provision for credit losses 
most of the  million in goodwill impairment charges related to the acquisitions of sky financial and unizan 
while this impairment charge reduced reported net income  equity  and total assets  it had no impact on key regulatory capital ratios 
as a noncash charge  it had no affect on our liquidity 
the provision for credit losses reflected higher net charge offs as we addressed issues in our loan portfolio 
we also strengthened our allowance for credit losses because of higher levels of nonperforming assets 
fully taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in  up billion  or  from the increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of the increase in net interest margin to from and  to a lesser degree  a increase in average total earning assets 
a significant portion of the increase in the net interest margin reflected a shift in our deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost transaction based accounts 
additionally  we grew our average core deposits billion  or  from although average total earning assets increased only slightly compared with  this change reflected a billion  or  increase in average total investment securities  partially offset by a billion  or  decline in average total loans and leases 
the change in average loan balances from the prior year reflected our strategy to reduce our cre exposure as average cre loans declined billion  or  from average c i loans declined billion  or  for the full year 
average automobile loans and leases increased billion  or  from  reflecting the consolidation of a billion automobile loan securitization on january  these changes in loan and investment securities balances from the prior year reflected the execution of our balance sheet management strategy  and not a change in standards for making loans or for investing in securities 
noninterest income was billion in  a slight increase compared with the increase in noninterest income was primarily a result of an increase in mortgage banking income  reflecting an increase in origination and secondary marketing income as loan originations and loan sales were substantially higher  and msr hedging 
this was partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts  which was due to a decline in personal nsf od service charges 
the decline reflected our implementation of changes to regulation e and the introduction of our fair play banking philosophy 
as part of this philosophy  we voluntarily reduced certain nsf od fees and implemented our hour grace tm overdraft policy 
the goal of our fair play banking philosophy is to introduce more customer friendly fee structures with the objective of accelerating the acquisition and retention of customers 
noninterest expense was billion in  a decrease of billion  or  compared with the decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to goodwill impairment in the year ago period 
the decline also reflected a decrease in oreo and foreclosure expense from lower oreo losses 
further  there was a decline in deposit and other insurance expense  primarily due to a million fdic insurance special assessment in  partially offset by continued growth in total deposits and higher fdic insurance costs in the current period as premium rates increased 
the decline was partially offset by a benefit from a gain on the early extinguishment of debt  and increases in personnel costs  reflecting a combination of factors 
table of contents including higher salaries due to a increase in full time equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives  higher sales commissions  and retirement fund and k plan expenses 
credit quality performance continued to show strong improvement as our npas and ncos declined and reserve coverage increased 
this improvement reflected the benefits of our focused actions taken in to address credit related issues 
compared with the prior year  npas declined 
ncos were million  or an annualized of average total loans and leases  down from  million  or  in while the acl as a percentage of loans and leases was  down from at december   the acl as a percentage of total nals increased to from 
in december  we successfully completed multiple capital actions  particularly improving our then relatively low level of common equity 
we sold million of common stock in a public offering and issued million of subordinated debt 
on december   these proceeds  along with other available funds  were used to complete the repurchase of our billion of tarp capital we issued to the treasury under its tarp cpp 
subsequently  on january   we exited our tarp related relationship with the treasury by repurchasing the warrant we had issued to the treasury as part of the tarp cpp for million 
the warrant had entitled the treasury to purchase million common shares of stock 
at december   our regulatory tier and total risk based capital were billion and billion  respectively  above the well capitalized regulatory thresholds 
our tangible common equity ratio improved basis points to and our tier common risk based capital ratio improved basis points to from december  business overview general our general business objectives are grow revenue and profitability  grow key fee businesses existing and new  improve credit quality  including lower ncos and npas  improve cross sell and share of wallet across all business segments  reduce cre noncore exposure  and continue to improve our overall management of risk 
as further described below  our main challenge to accomplishing our primary objectives results from an economy  that while more stable than a year ago  remains fragile 
this impairs our ability to grow loans as customers continue to reduce their debt and or remain cautious about increasing debt until they have a higher degree of confidence in a meaningful sustainable economic recovery 
however  growth in our automobile loan portfolio continued with originations of billion  an increase of billion compared to strong growth in originations reflected increases in all of our markets  as well as the recent expansion of our automobile lending business into eastern pennsylvania and five new england states 
we expect our growth in the newly entered markets to become more evident over time as we further develop our dealership base 
although our residential real estate portfolio declined slightly from  our mortgage originations increased million  or  from the prior year 
our cre portfolio declined throughout the year as a result of our on going strategy to reduce our cre exposure 
the decline was primarily a result of continuing paydowns in the noncore cre portfolio 
we face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets 
as such  we have placed strategic emphasis on  and continue to develop and expand resources devoted to  improving cross sell performance with our core customer base 
one example of this emphasis was our recent agreement with giant eagle supermarkets to be its exclusive in store bank in ohio 
during the fourth quarter  we opened four such in store branches 
when fully implemented  the partnership will give us an additional branches  which in the aggregate will be nearly branches in ohio  providing us with the largest branch presence among ohio banks  based on current data 
in store branches have a strong record for checking account acquisition and are expected to increase the number of households served and drive revenue 
additionally  it will give customers the convenience of operating seven days per week and extended hours banking 

table of contents economy the weak residential real estate market and us economy has had a significant adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole  and specifically on our financial results 
in addition  the us recession during and and continued high midwest unemployment have hindered any significant economic recovery 
however  some indications of recovery are beginning to take hold 
following is a discussion of certain economic trends in our market area  particularly ohio and michigan 
the median home prices in the midwest market have been directionally consistent with the nationwide averages 
in the years preceding the economic crisis  home prices in michigan and ohio did not increase as rapidly as the national trend and became more in line with the national averages during the crisis 
therefore  when real estate prices began to decline in  the impact in our midwest markets was reduced because pre crisis originations were not based on values that were as inflated as in other parts of the country 
home prices in the midwest are generally expected to follow the national growth rates over the next two years 
residential real estate sales in the midwest have been consistent with national averages 
single family home building permits are expected to increase both nationally and in the midwest through year over year changes in median household income in the midwest have been consistent with national averages and directionally similar with national trends 
both the us and midwest are expected to have slight  but positive  income growth over the next two years 
unemployment in the midwest has been consistently higher than the national average for most of the past decade 
however  the relative difference is expected to narrow over the next two years  with the midwest unemployment rate converging to the us average 
the exception is michigan  which has the second highest unemployment level in the country 
from october through october  indiana s employment growth of was among the strongest in the country 
over this same time period  ohio s manufacturing employment grew  which was significantly higher than the national average 
cleveland s overall employment growth of exceeded the national growth rate of 
according to the frb cleveland beige book in december  manufacturers in our footprint indicated that new orders and production were stable or rose slightly during the last two months of inventory levels were balanced with incoming order demand and capacity utilization trending up for some manufacturers and steel producers 
overall  manufacturers were cautiously optimistic and expect at least modest growth during partially resulting from these economic conditions in our footprint  we experienced higher than historical levels of loan delinquencies and ncos during and the pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early resulted in lower residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and ncos  not only in consumer mortgage loans but also in commercial loans to builders and developers of residential real estate 
the value of our investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate was also negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses 
commercial real estate loans for retail businesses were also challenged by the difficult consumer economic conditions over this period 
however  as further discussed in the credit risk section  we experienced significant improvement in credit performance during legislative and regulatory legislative and regulatory reforms continue to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on current business practices 
recent actions affecting us included an amendment to regulation e relating to certain overdraft fees for consumer deposit accounts and the passage of the dodd frank act 
effective july   the federal reserve board amended regulation e to prohibit charging overdraft fees for atm or point of sale debit card transactions that overdraw the customer s account unless the customer opts in to the discretionary overdraft service 
for us  such fees were approximately million per year prior to the amendment 
this change in regulation e requires us to alert our consumer customers we can no longer allow an overdraft unless they opt in to our discretionary overdraft service 
to date  the number of customers choosing to opt in has been higher than our expectations 
also  during the second half of  we voluntarily 
table of contents reduced certain overdraft fees and introduced hour grace tm on overdrafts as part of our fair play banking philosophy designed to build on our foundation of service excellence 
we expect our hour grace tm service to accelerate acquisition of new checking customers  while improving retention of existing customers 
the recently passed dodd frank act is complex and we continue to assess how this legislation and subsequent rule making will affect us 
as hundreds of regulations are promulgated  we will continue to evaluate impacts such as changes in regulatory costs and fees  modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb  and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions  among others 
two areas where we are focusing on the financial impact are interchange fees and the exclusion of trust preferred securities from our tier i regulatory capital 
currently  interchange fees are approximately million per year 
in the future  the dodd frank act gives the federal reserve  and no longer the banks or system owners  the ability to set the interchange rate charged to merchants for the use of debit cards 
the ultimate impact to us will depend on rules yet to be issued by the federal reserve 
proposed rules were issued on december   and the dodd frank act requires final interchange rules to be issued by april   and effective no later than july  based on the federal reserve s proposed rules  a maximum interchange rate of would reduce our annual interchange fees by approximately 
a maximum interchange rate of would reduce our annual interchange fees by approximately at december   we had million of outstanding trust preferred securities that  if disallowed  would reduce our regulatory tier risk based capital ratio by approximately basis points 
even with this reduction  our capital ratios would remain above well capitalized levels 
there is a three year phase in period beginning on january   that we believe will provide sufficient time to evaluate and address the impacts of this new legislation on our capital structure 
accordingly  we do not anticipate this potential change will have a significant impact to our business 
during the third quarter  the basel committee on banking supervision revised the capital accord basel iii  which narrows the definition of capital and increases capital requirements for specific exposures 
the new capital requirements will be phased in over six years beginning in if these revisions were adopted currently  we estimate they would have a negligible impact on our regulatory capital ratios based on our current understanding of the revisions to capital qualification 
we await clarification from our banking regulators on their interpretation of basel iii and any additional requirements to the stated thresholds 
the fdic has approved issuance of an interagency proposed rulemaking to implement certain provisions of section of the dodd frank act section 
section provides that the capital requirements generally applicable to insured banks shall serve as a floor for other capital requirements the agencies establish 
the fdic noted that the advanced approaches of basel iii allow for reductions in risk based capital requirements below those generally applicable to insured banks and  accordingly  need to be modified to be consistent with section recent industry developments foreclosure documentation we evaluated our foreclosure documentation procedures given the recent announcements made by other financial institutions regarding problems associated with their foreclosure activities 
as a result of our review  we have determined that we do not have any significant issues relating to so called robo signing  foreclosure affidavits were completed and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the contents of the affidavits  and there is no reason to conclude that foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed 
additionally  we have identified and are implementing process and control enhancements to ensure that affidavits continue to be prepared in compliance with applicable state law 
we are consulting with local foreclosure counsel as necessary with respect to additional requirements imposed by the courts in which foreclosure proceedings are pending  which could impact our foreclosure actions 
representation and warranty reserve we primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with fannie mae and freddie mac 
in connection with these and other sale and securitization transactions  we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria  such as collateral type and underwriting standards 
in the future  we may be required to repurchase individual loans and or indemnify 
table of contents these organizations against losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties 
at december   we have a reserve for such losses of million  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
expectations borrower and consumer confidence remains a major factor impacting growth opportunities for we continue to believe that the economy will remain relatively stable throughout  with the potential for improvement in the latter half 
challenges to earnings growth include revenue headwinds as a result of regulatory and legislative actions  anticipated higher interest rates as we enter  which is expected to reduce mortgage banking income  and continued investments in growing our businesses 
reflecting these factors  pre tax  pre provision income levels are expected to remain in line with second half performance 
nevertheless  net income growth from the fourth quarter level is anticipated throughout the year 
this will primarily reflect on going reductions in credit costs 
we expect the absolute levels of ncos  npas  and criticized loans will continue to decline  resulting in lower levels of provision expense 
given the significant credit related improvements in  coupled with our expectation for continued improvement  our return to more normalized levels of credit costs could occur earlier than previously expected 
the net interest margin is expected to be flat or increase slightly from the fourth quarter 
we anticipate continued benefit from lower deposit pricing 
in addition  the absolute growth in loans compared with deposits is anticipated to be more comparable  thus reducing the absolute growth in lower yield investment securities 
the automobile loan portfolio is expected to continue its strong growth  and we anticipate continued growth in c i loans 
home equity and residential mortgages are likely to show only modest growth 
cre loans are expected to continue to decline  but at a slower rate 
core deposits are expected to show continued growth 
further  we expect the shift toward lower cost demand deposit accounts will continue 
fee income  compared with the fourth quarter  will be negatively impacted by lower interchange fees due to regulatory fee change and a decline in mortgage banking revenues due to a higher interest rate environment as we enter with regard to interchange fees  if enacted as recently outlined  the federal reserve s proposed interchange fee structure will significantly lower interchange revenue 
other fee categories are expected to grow  reflecting the impact of our cross sell initiatives throughout the company  as well as the positive impact from strategic initiatives 
over time  we anticipate more than offsetting revenue challenges with revenue we expect to generate by accelerating customer growth and cross sell results 
expense levels early in the year should be up modestly from fourth quarter performance  with increases later in the year due to continued investments to grow the business

for additional insight on financial performance  please read this section in conjunction with the item business segment discussion 
significant items definition of significant items from time to time  revenue  expenses  or taxes  are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and or by items that  while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities  are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature 
we refer to such items as significant items 
most often  these significant items result from factors originating outside the company  eg  regulatory actions assessments  windfall gains  changes in accounting principles  one time tax assessments refunds  etc 
in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  eg  merger restructuring charges  recapitalization actions  goodwill impairment  etc 
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions  as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item 
for example  changes in the provision for credit losses  gains losses from investment activities  asset valuation writedowns  etc  reflect ordinary banking activities and are  therefore  typically excluded from consideration as a significant item 
we believe the disclosure of significant items in results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items  if any  to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance  ie  within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations  as well as how  if at all  to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly 
to this end  we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg  earnings press releases  investor presentations  forms q and k 
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance 
significant items influencing financial performance comparisons earnings comparisons among the three years ended december    and were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below 
tarp capital purchase program repurchase 
during the fourth quarter  we issued million of our common stock and million of subordinated debt 
the net proceeds  along with other available funds  were used to repurchase all billion of tarp capital that we issued to the treasury under its tarp capital purchase program in as part of this transaction  there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income  but resulted in a negative impact of per common share for 
table of contents goodwill impairment 
the impacts of goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows during the first quarter  bank stock prices  including ours  experienced a steep decline 
our stock price declined from per share at december   to per share at march  given this significant decline  we conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment 
as a result  we recorded a noncash  million per common share pretax charge 
see goodwill discussion located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section for additional information 
during the second quarter  a pretax goodwill impairment of million per common share was recorded relating to the sale of a small payments related business in july franklin relationship 
our relationship with franklin was acquired in the sky financial acquisition in significant events relating to this relationship  and the impacts of those events on our reported results  were as follows on march   we restructured our relationship with franklin 
as a result of this restructuring  a nonrecurring net tax benefit of million per common share was recorded in the first quarter 
also  and although earnings were not significantly impacted  commercial ncos increased million as the previously established million franklin specific alll was utilized to writedown the acquired mortgages and oreo collateral to fair value 
during the first quarter  a million per common share net tax benefit was recognized  primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march  restructuring 
during the second quarter  the portfolio of franklin related loans million of residential mortgages and million of home equity loans was transferred to loans held for sale 
at the time of the transfer  the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell of million  resulting in million of charge offs  and the provision for credit losses commensurately increased million per common share 
during the third quarter  the remaining franklin related residential mortgage and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value 
early extinguishment of debt 
the positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results were million per common share in and million per common share in these amounts were recorded to noninterest expense 
preferred stock conversion 
during the first and second quarters  we converted  and  shares  respectively  of series a non cumulative perpetual preferred series a preferred stock stock into common stock 
as part of these transactions  there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income  but resulted in a negative impact of per common share for see capital discussion located within the risk management and capital section for additional information 
visa 
prior to the visa ipo occurring in march  visa was owned by its member banks  which included the bank 
as a result of this ownership  we received class b shares of visa stock at the time of the visa ipo

pretax  pre provision income trends one non gaap performance measurement that we believe is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends  particularly in times of economic stress  is pretax  pre provision income

other companies may calculate this financial measure differently 
as discussed in more detail in the sections that follow  the increase from primarily reflected improved revenue  including higher net interest income  partially offset by higher noninterest expense  including personnel costs and marketing 
net interest income average balance sheet our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans  securities  and direct financing leases  and interest expense of funding sources primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
earning asset balances and related funding sources  as well as changes in the levels of interest rates  impact net interest income 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread 
noninterest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets 
the impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds  often referred to as free funds  is captured in the net interest margin  which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income  assuming a tax rate

both the irs and state tax officials  including ohio and kentucky  have proposed adjustments to our previously filed tax returns 
we believe that our tax positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes  regulations  and judicial authority  and intend to vigorously defend them 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs 
however  although no assurance can be given  we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
versus the provision for income taxes was a benefit of million for compared with a benefit of million in the tax benefit for both years included the benefits from tax exempt income  tax advantaged investments  and general business credits

risk management and capital risk awareness  identification  reporting  and active management are key elements in overall risk management 
we manage risk to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile strategy through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks 
controls include  among others  effective segregation of duties  access  authorization and reconciliation procedures  as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process 
as a strategy  we have identified sources of risks and primary risks in coordination with each business unit 
we utilize risk and control self assessments rcsa to identify exposure risks 
through this rcsa process  we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks  regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses  and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed 
our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the company 
potential risk concerns are shared with the risk management committee and the board of directors  as appropriate 
our internal audit department performs on going independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents we believe our primary risk exposures are credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in our borrowers ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future obligations resulting from external macro market issues  investor perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
operational risk arises from our inherent day to day operations that could result in losses due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  and external events 
compliance risk exposes us to money penalties  enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws  rules  and regulations that apply to the financial services industry 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation 
the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities  as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending 
we also have significant credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolio see investment securities portfolio discussion 
while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity  we believe this exposure is minimal 
the significant change in the economic conditions and the resulting changes in borrower behavior over the past several years resulted in our focusing significant resources to the identification  monitoring  and managing of our credit risk 
in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes  market risk management activities  and portfolio diversification  we added more quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources  enhanced use of modeling technology  and internal stress testing processes 
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers 
all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 
concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type  geography  industry  and loan quality factors 
we continue to focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets  although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 
we continue to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and profitability profile 
although we offer a broad set of products  we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities 
each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk portfolio profile 
the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of credit risk being accepted  facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur  and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution 
for example  we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position 
asset quality metrics improved significantly in  reflecting our proactive portfolio management initiatives as well as some stabilization in a still relatively weak economy 
the improvements in the asset quality metrics  including lower levels of npas  criticized and classified assets  and delinquencies have all been achieved through these policies and commitments 
our portfolio management policies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
to that end  we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas 
the weak residential real estate market and us economy continued to have significant impact on the financial services industry as a whole  and specifically on our financial results 
a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early has resulted in significantly lower residential real estate 
table of contents values and higher delinquencies and ncos  including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate 
in addition  continued high unemployment  among other factors  throughout  has slowed any significant recovery from the us recession during and as a result  we experienced higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our loan portfolios during and the value of our investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate was also negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses 
loan and lease credit exposure mix at december   our loans and leases totaled billion  representing a increase from december  the composition of the portfolio has changed significantly over the past months 
from december   to december   the consumer loan portfolio increased billion  or  primarily driven by the automobile loan portfolio 
in  our indirect automobile finance business generated significant levels of high credit quality loan originations  and we also adopted a new accounting standard resulting in the consolidation of a billion automobile loan securitization 
at december   these securitized loans had a remaining balance of million 
these increases were partially offset by a billion  or  decline in the commercial loan portfolio  primarily as a result of a planned strategy to reduce the concentration of our noncore cre portfolio 
at december   commercial loans totaled billion  and represented of our total credit exposure 
our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type  size  and geography within our footprint  and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion c i loans c i loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases  or other projects 
the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions 
c i loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral 
this treatment is a function of the credit decision process  which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt 
the operation  sale  rental  or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans 
as we look to expand c i loan growth  we have further developed our abl capabilities by adding experienced abl professionals to take advantage of market opportunities resulting in better leveraging of the manufacturing base in our primary markets 
we have also added a national banking group with sufficient resources to ensure we appropriately recognize and manage the risks associated with this type of lending 
cre loans cre loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties  real estate investment trusts  and real estate developers 
we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement 
these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers  and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation  sale  or refinance of the property 
construction cre loans construction cre loans are loans to individuals  companies  or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property 
our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail  residential land  single family  and condominiums  office  and warehouse product types 
generally  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold  preleased  or have secured permanent financing  as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project 
these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule 

table of contents total consumer loans were billion at december   and represented of our total credit exposure 
the consumer portfolio was diversified among home equity loans  residential mortgages  and automobile loans and leases see consumer credit discussion 
automobile loans leases automobile loans leases are primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships and includes exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets 
in  we exited several states  including florida  arizona  and nevada 
in  we expanded into eastern pennsylvania and five new england states 
the recent expansions included hiring experienced colleagues with existing dealer relationships in those markets 
no state outside of our primary banking market represented more than of our total automobile loan and lease portfolio at december  our automobile lease portfolio represents an immaterial portion of the total portfolio as we exited the automobile leasing business during the fourth quarter 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second lien on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
given the current low interest rate environment  many borrowers have utilized the line of credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home 
as a result  the proportion of first lien loans has increased significantly in our portfolio over the past months 
real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in the event of default  subsequent changes in these values may impact the severity of losses 
we actively manage the amount of credit extended through debt to income policies and ltv policy limits 
residential mortgages residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence 
these loans are generally financed over a to year term  and in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
generally  our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
as such  the majority of the loans in our portfolio are arms 
these arms primarily consist of a fixed rate of interest for the first to years  and then adjust annually 
these loans comprised approximately of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio at december  other consumer loans leases primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate or automobiles  including personal unsecured loans

commercial credit the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower  assessment of the borrower s management capabilities  cash flows from operations  industry sector trends  type 
table of contents and sufficiency of collateral  type of exposure  transaction structure  and the general economic outlook 
while these are the primary factors considered  there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process 
for all loans exceeding million  we utilize a centralized senior loan committee  led by our chief credit officer 
for loans less than million  with the exception of small business loans  credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority 
for small business loans less than million  we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures 
in this centralized decision environment  certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in 
in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors  a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process 
in commercial lending  on going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan 
we monitor all significant exposures on an on going basis 
all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower s probability of default and loss given default severity of loss 
this two dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process 
the probability of default is rated and applied at the borrower level 
the loss given default is rated and applied based on the type of credit extension and the underlying collateral 
the internal risk ratings are assessed and updated with each periodic monitoring event 
there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on going basis 
as an example  the retail properties class of the cre portfolio has received more frequent evaluation at the individual loan level given the weak environment  portfolio concentration  and stressed performance trends see retail properties discussion 
we continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience  which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate acl amount for this portfolio 
in addition to the initial credit analysis initiated during the approval process  the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and or risk of the new loan production 
this group is part of our risk management area  and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk based cycle to evaluate individual loans  validate risk ratings  as well as test the consistency of credit processes 
similarly  to provide consistent oversight  a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of small business banking loans 
the commercial loan ratings described above are categorized as follows pass commercial loans categorized as pass are higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below 
olem commercial loans categorized as olem are potentially weak 
the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances 
if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated  the asset may weaken or inadequately protect our position in the future 
substandard commercial loans categorized as substandard are inadequately protected by the borrower s ability to repay  equity  and or the collateral pledged to secure the loan 
these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt 
it is likely that we will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated 
doubtful commercial loans categorized as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard  with the added elements that the full collection of the loan is improbable and the possibility of loss is high 
commercial loans rated as olem  substandard  or doubtful are considered criticized 
commercial loans rated as substandard or doubtful are considered classified 
commercial loans may be designated as criticized when warranted by individual borrower performance or by industry and environmental factors 
commercial criticized loans are subjected to additional monthly reviews to adequately assess the borrower s credit status and develop appropriate action plans 
we re evaluate the risk rating of these criticized commercial loans as conditions change  potentially resulting in a further rating adjustment 
changes in the rating can be impacted by borrower performance  external factors such as industry and economic changes  as well as structural 
table of contents changes to the loan arrangements including  but not limited to  amortization  collateral  guarantees  and covenants 
all classified commercial loans are managed by our sad 
the sad is a specialized credit group that handles the day to day management of workouts  commercial recoveries  and problem loan sales 
its responsibilities include developing action plans  assessing risk ratings  and determining the adequacy of the reserve  the accrual status  and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio 
our commercial loan portfolio  including cre loans  is diversified by customer size  as well as geographically throughout our footprint 
during  we engaged in a large number of enhanced portfolio management initiatives  including a review to ensure the appropriate classification of cre loans 
the results of this initiative included reclassifications in totaling billion that increased c i loan balances  and correspondingly decreased cre loan balances  primarily representing owner occupied properties 
we believe the changes provide improved visibility and clarity to us and our investors 
we have continued this active portfolio management process throughout  primarily focusing on improving our ability to identify changing conditions at the borrower level  which in most cases  significantly improved the outcome 
this process allows us to provide clarity regarding the credit trends in our portfolios 
certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed in further detail below c i portfolio the c i portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on going operations of the business 
generally  the loans are secured with the financing of the borrower s assets  such as equipment  accounts receivable  or inventory 
in many cases  the loans are secured by real estate  although the operation  sale  or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan 
for loans secured by real estate  appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements 
there were no outstanding commercial loans considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending 
currently  higher risk segments of the c i portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry  contractors  and automotive suppliers 
we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies  concentration limits  on going loan level reviews  recourse requirements  and continuous portfolio risk management activities 
our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios  as applicable 
c i borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy  and some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress 
as a result  these borrowers may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements 
we continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions 
the impact of the economic environment is further evidenced by the level of line of credit activity  as borrowers continued to maintain relatively low utilization percentages over the past months 
as shown in the following table  c i loans totaled billion at december  table commercial and industrial loans and leases by class at december  commitments loans outstanding amount percent amount percent dollar amounts in millions class owner occupied other commercial and industrial total 
table of contents the differences in the composition between the commitments and loans outstanding results from the owner occupied class consisting almost entirely of term loans  while the remainder of the c i portfolio contains a significant amount of working capital lines of credit 
the funding percentage associated with the lines of credit has been a significant indicator of credit quality  as businesses have reduced their borrowings 
generally  borrowers that fully utilize their line of credit consistently  over time  have a higher risk profile 
this represents one of many credit risk factors we utilize in assessing the credit risk portfolio of individual borrowers and the overall portfolio 
cre portfolio we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio the same as the c i portfolio  with the addition of preleasing requirements  as applicable 
generally  we limit our loans to of the appraised value of the commercial real estate  require net operating cash flows to be of required interest and principal payments  and if the commercial real estate is non owner occupied  require that at least of the space of the project be pre leased 
dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio  with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions 
appraisals are obtained from approved vendors  and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process 
the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size  and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio 
subsequent to the origination of the loan  the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and or risk of the new loan production 
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals  and on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
given the stressed environment for some loan types  we perform on going portfolio level reviews of certain loan classes such as the retail properties class within the cre portfolio see retail properties discussion 
these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed 
the results of these reviews indicate that some additional stress is likely due to the continued weak economic conditions 
property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions 
this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers  as well as an in depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment 
we actively monitor the concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types  with a focus on higher risk classes 
macro level stress test scenarios based on retail sales and home price depreciation trends for the classes are embedded in our performance expectations  and lease up and absorption scenarios are assessed 
each cre loan is classified as either core or noncore 
we separated the cre portfolio into these categories in order to provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies and to provide additional clarity for us and our investors 
we believe segregating the noncore cre from core cre improves our ability to understand the nature  performance prospects  and problem resolution opportunities of these segments  thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues 
a cre loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced  well capitalized developer in our midwest footprint  and has either an established meaningful relationship with the borrower generating an acceptable return on capital or demonstrates the prospect of becoming one 
the core cre portfolio was billion at december   representing of total cre loans 
the performance of the core portfolio met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio 
based on our extensive project level assessment process  including forward looking collateral valuations  we continue to believe the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable 
a cre loan is generally considered noncore based on the lack of a substantive relationship outside of the loan product  with no immediate prospects for meeting the core relationship criteria

of the loans in the noncore portfolio at december   were classified as pass  had guarantors  were secured  and were located within our geographic footprint 
however  it is within the noncore portfolio where most of the credit quality challenges exist 
for example  billion  or  of related outstanding balances  are classified as nals 
sad administered billion  or  of total noncore cre loans at december  we expect to exit the majority of noncore cre relationships over time through normal repayments  possible sales should economically attractive opportunities arise  or the reclassification to a core cre relationship if it expands to meet the core criteria

table of contents as shown in the above table  the ending balance of the cre portfolio at december   declined billion compared with december  this decline was entirely centered in the noncore segment of the portfolio and was a result of payoffs and ncos as we actively focus on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall cre exposure 
this reduction occurred in a very difficult market  and demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a moderate to low risk profile 
we anticipate further noncore cre declines in future periods based on our overall strategy to reduce our overall cre exposure 
also as shown above  substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established 
at december   the acl related to the noncore portfolio was 
the combination of the existing acl and prior ncos represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio 
from this data  we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment 
we believe the combined credit activity is appropriate for each of the cre segments 
within the cre portfolio  the retail properties and single family home builder classes continue to be stressed as a result of the continued decline in the housing markets and general economic conditions and are discussed below 
retail properties our portfolio of cre loans secured by retail properties totaled billion  or approximately of total loans and leases  at december  loans within this portfolio segment declined billion  or  from billion at december  credit approval in this portfolio segment is generally dependent on preleasing requirements  and net operating income from the project must cover debt service by specified percentages when the loan is fully funded 
the weakness of the economic environment in our geographic regions continued to impact the projects that secure the loans in this portfolio segment 
lower occupancy rates  reduced rental rates  and the expectation these levels will remain stressed for the foreseeable future may adversely affect some of our borrowers ability to repay these loans 
we have increased the level of credit risk management activity on this portfolio segment  and we analyze our retail property loans in detail by combining property type  geographic location  and other data  to assess and manage our credit concentration risks 
we review the majority of this portfolio segment on a monthly basis 
single family home builders at december   we had billion of cre loans to single family home builders 
such loans represented of total loans and leases 
the billion represented a billion  or  decrease compared with billion at december  the decrease primarily reflected runoff activity as few new loans have been originated since  property sale activity  and ncos 
based on portfolio management processes over the past three years  including nco activity  we believe we have substantially addressed the credit issues in this portfolio 
we do not anticipate any future significant credit impact from this portfolio segment 
franklin relationship in  we sold our portfolio of franklin related loans to unrelated third parties 
also  we recorded million of franklin related ncos  of which million related to the loan sales 
the provision for credit losses included million related to franklin  with million related to the loan sales 
at december   the only franklin related nonperforming assets remaining were million of oreo properties  which were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on  among other factors  the financial strength and payment history of the borrower  type of exposure  and the transaction structure 
consumer credit decisions are generally made 
table of contents in a centralized environment utilizing decision models 
importantly  certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in 
each credit extension is assigned a specific probability of default and loss given default 
the probability of default is generally based on the borrower s most recent credit bureau score fico  which we update quarterly  while the loss given default is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension 
in consumer lending  credit risk is managed from a loan type and vintage performance analysis 
all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators 
we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio  which may result in changes to future origination strategies 
the on going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio 
the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes 
collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function 
the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency 
in addition to the consumer loan portfolio  the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases 
automobile loans and leases portfolio the performance of the automobile loan and lease portfolio improved in  despite the continued economic conditions that have adversely affected the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios discussed below 
our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores  combined with appropriate ltv s  terms  and a reasonable level of profitability 
this strategy resulted in a significant improvement in performance metrics in compared to  and provides us with substantial confidence for future performance of this portfolio 
in  we continued to consistently execute our value proposition and took advantage of market opportunities that allowed us to grow our automobile loan portfolio 
the significant growth in the portfolio was accomplished while maintaining high credit quality metrics 
as we further execute our strategies and take advantage of these opportunities  we are developing alternative plans to address any growth in excess of our established portfolio concentration limits  including both securitizations and loan sales 
the automobile sales market expanded in and by entering into eastern pennsylvania and five new england states  we are positioned to take advantage of a continued expansion in our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio  including our newer markets 
although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels  we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks 
residential secured portfolios the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located throughout our footprint 
the continued slowdown in the housing market negatively impacted the performance of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 
while the degree of price depreciation varied across our markets  all regions throughout our footprint were affected

ltv ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination 
portfolio weighted average fico scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average fico scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination 
represents only owned portfolio originations 
home equity portfolio our home equity portfolio loans and lines of credit consists of both first and second mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores  debt to income ratios  and ltv ratios 
we offer closed end home equity loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments  and variable rate interest only home equity lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the year revolving period of the line of credit 
at december   approximately of our home equity portfolio was secured by first mortgage liens 
the credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first mortgage lien position 
during  more than of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first mortgage lien 
we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint 
the majority of our home equity line of credit borrowers consistently pay more than the required interest only amount 
additionally  since we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers  many of our home equity borrowers are utilizing other products and services 
we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio 
we have not originated stated income home equity loans or lines of credit that allow negative amortization 
also  we have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an ltv at origination greater than  except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers 
however  continued declines in housing prices have likely decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and it is likely some loans with an original ltv ratio of less than currently have an ltv ratio greater than 
for certain home equity loans and lines of credit  we may utilize an automated valuation model avm or other model driven value estimate during the credit underwriting process 
we utilize a series of credit parameters to determine the appropriate valuation methodology 
while we believe an avm estimate is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities  we continue to re evaluate all of our policies on an on going basis 
regardless of the estimate methodology  we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping  and outright fraudulent 
table of contents transactions 
we update values as we believe appropriate  and in compliance with applicable regulations  for loans identified as higher risk 
loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile  as well as industry actions 
in addition to origination policy adjustments  we take actions  as necessary  to manage the risk profile of this portfolio 
residential mortgages portfolio we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally  often through the use of an automated underwriting system 
we do not originate residential mortgage loans that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options 
all residential mortgage loans are originated based on a completed appraisal during the credit underwriting process 
additionally  we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping and outright fraudulent transactions 
we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
also  it is important to note the recent issuance of new regulatory guidelines regarding real estate valuations  the intent of which is to ensure there is complete independence in the requesting and review of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions 
we have been committed to appropriate valuations for all of our real estate lending  and do not anticipate significant impacts to our loan decision process as a result of these new guidelines 
several government actions were enacted that impacted the residential mortgage portfolio  including various refinance programs which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry 
we are utilizing these programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely with our customers 
credit quality we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance for is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios 
this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals  tdrs  acl  and ncos 
in addition  we utilize delinquency rates  risk distribution and migration patterns  and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance 
credit quality performance in improved significantly compared with while ncos remain elevated compared with long term expectations  continued to show improvement across the portfolio  and delinquency trends improved as well 
oreo also declined significantly in we do not believe there will be a meaningful improvement in property values in the near term  and believe it prudent to dispose of the oreo properties instead of incurring the on going expenses associated with maintaining the properties 
as such  the decrease in the oreo balances resulted from an active selling strategy  as well as a lower level of inflows associated with residential properties due to our active loss mitigation and short sale strategies 
the economic environment remained challenging 
yet  reflecting the benefit of our focused credit actions of and  we experienced declines in total npas  new npas  and commercial criticized loans 
our acl declined million to  million  or of period end loans and leases from  million  or at importantly  our acl as a percent of period end nals increased to from  and coverage ratios associated with npas and criticized assets also increased 
these improved coverage ratios indicated a strengthening of our reserve position relative to troubled assets from the prior year end 
these coverage ratios are a key component of our internal adequacy assessment process and provide an important consideration in the determination of the adequacy of the acl 

table of contents npas  nals  and tdrs this section should be read in conjunction with significant item npas and nals npas consist of nals  which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest  impaired loans held for sale  oreo properties  and other npas 
a c i or cre loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is days past due 
residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due  and a charge off recorded if it is determined that insufficient equity exists in the collateral property to support the entire outstanding loan amount 
a home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status at days past due  and a charge off recorded if it is determined there is not sufficient equity in the collateral property to cover our position 
for loans secured by residential real estate  the collateral equity position is determined by a current property valuation based on an expected marketing time period consistent with the market 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
when  in our judgment  the borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt  the loan or lease is returned to accrual status

tdr loans tdrs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties 
loan modifications are considered tdrs when the concession provided is not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources 
however  not all loan modifications are tdrs 
our standards relating to loan modifications consider  among other factors  minimum verified income requirements  cash flow analysis  and collateral valuations 
however  each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrower s specific circumstances at a point in time 
all loan modifications  including those classified as tdrs  are reviewed and approved 
our alll is largely driven by updated risk ratings to commercial loans  updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans  and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
as such  the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the tdr classification 
tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded because the borrower remains contractually current 
the table below provides a summary of our tdrs both accrual and nonaccrual by loan type at december  and table accruing and nonaccruing troubled debt restructured loans december  dollar amounts in thousands restructured loans and leases accruing mortgage loans other consumer loans commercial loans total restructured loans and leases accruing restructured loans and leases nonaccruing mortgage loans other consumer loans commercial loans total restructured loans and leases nonaccruing total restructured loans and leases in the workout of a problem loan  there are many factors considered when determining the most favorable resolution 
for consumer loans  we evaluate the ability and willingness of the borrower to make contractual or reduced payments  the value of the underlying collateral  and the costs associated with the foreclosure or repossession  and remarketing of the collateral 
for commercial loans  we consider similar criteria and also evaluate the borrower s business prospects 
residential mortgage loan tdrs residential mortgage tdrs represent loan modifications associated with traditional first lien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower 
residential mortgages identified as tdrs involve borrowers who are unable to refinance their mortgages through our normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources 
some  but not all  of the loans may be delinquent 
modifications can include adjustments to rates and or principal 
modified loans identified as tdrs are aggregated into pools for analysis 
cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooled loan level 
once the loans are aggregated into the pool  they continue to be 
table of contents classified as tdrs until contractually repaid or charged off 
no consideration is given to removing individual loans from the pools 
residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a us government agency such as the fha  va  and the usda  including restructured loans  are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status 
nals are those that are greater than days contractually past due 
loans guaranteed by us government organizations continue to accrue interest upon delinquency 
residential mortgage loan tdr classifications resulted in an impairment adjustment of million in prior to the tdr classification  residential mortgage loans individually had minimal alll associated with them because the alll is calculated on a total portfolio pooled basis 
other consumer loan tdrs generally  these are tdrs associated with home equity borrowings and automobile loans 
we make similar interest rate  term  and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan tdrs 
the tdr classification for these other consumer loans resulted in an impairment adjustment of million in commercial loan tdrs commercial accruing tdrs represent loans in which a loan rated as classified is current on contractual principal and interest but undergoes a loan modification 
accruing tdrs often result from loans rated as classified receiving an extension on the maturity of their loan  for example  to allow additional time for the sale or lease of underlying cre collateral 
often  it is prudent to extend the maturity rather than foreclose on a commercial loan  particularly for borrowers who are generating cash flows to support contractual interest payments 
these borrowers cannot obtain the modified loan through other independent sources because of their current financial circumstances  therefore a concession is provided and the modification is classified as a tdr 
the tdr remains in accruing status as long as the customer is current on payments and no loss is probable 
commercial nonaccrual tdrs result from either workouts where an existing commercial nal is restructured into multiple new loans  or from an accruing commercial tdr being placed on nonaccrual status 
at december   approximately million of our commercial nonaccrual tdrs resulted from such workouts 
the remaining million represented the reclassifications of accruing tdrs to nals 
for certain loan workouts  we create two or more new notes 
the senior note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards at current market rates and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest 
the terms on the subordinate note s vary by situation  but often defer interest payments until after the senior note is repaid 
creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project or weather a temporary economic downturn and allows us to right size a loan based upon the current expectations for a project performance 
the senior note is considered for return to accrual status if the borrower has sustained sufficient cash flows for a six month period of time and we believe no loss is probable 
this six month period could extend before or after the restructure date 
subordinated notes created in the workout are charged off immediately 
any interest or principal payments received on the subordinated notes are applied to the principal of the senior note first until the senior note is repaid 
further payments are recorded as recoveries on the subordinated note 
as the loans are already considered classified  an adequate alll has been recorded when appropriate 
consequently  a tdr classification on commercial loans does not usually result in significant additional reserves 
we consider removing the tdr status on commercial loans if the loan is at a market rate of interest and after the loan has performed in accordance with the restructured terms for a sustained period of time  generally one year

the over day delinquency ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a us government agency was at december   representing a basis point decline compared with december  this decrease primarily reflected continued improvement in our core performance  as well as the impact of the sale of certain underperforming loans in the increase in accruing tdrs primarily reflects our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers having difficulty making their payments 

table of contents acl this section should be read in conjunction with significant item  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain two reserves  both of which in our judgment are adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc 
combined  these reserves comprise the total acl 
our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation  as well as determining the adequacy of the acl 
the alll represents the estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date 
additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating downgrades  while reductions reflect charge offs  recoveries  decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating upgrades  or the sale of loans 
the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation 
a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the provision for credit losses in was million  compared with  million in  primarily reflecting significantly lower ncos in compared with  and improved credit quality metrics 
while credit quality metrics have significantly improved during  provision expense since has been higher than historical levels  reflecting the pronounced downturn in the us economy  as well as significant deterioration in the residential real estate market that began in early declining real estate valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and ncos have negatively affected the quality of our loans secured by real estate 
portions of the residential portfolio  as well as the single family home builder and developer loans in the commercial portfolio  experienced the majority of the credit issues related to the residential real estate market 
we regularly assess the adequacy of the acl by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the financial condition of specific borrowers  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or other documented support 
we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of our acl at each reporting date 
in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above  we also consider the impact of declining residential real estate values and the diversification of cre loans  particularly loans secured by retail properties 
our acl assessment process includes the on going assessment of credit quality metrics  and a comparison of certain acl adequacy benchmarks to current performance 
while the total acl balance declined in compared with  all of the relevant benchmarks improved as a result of the asset quality improvement 
the coverage ratios of nals  criticized and classified loans all showed significant improvement in despite the decline in the acl level

a concerted effort was made to reduce potential exposure associated with unfunded lines and to generate an appropriate level of return on those that remain in place 
in addition  borrowers continued to reassess their borrowing needs and reduced their desired funding capacity 
the acl coverage ratio associated with nals was at december   representing a significant improvement compared with at december  this improvement reflected substantial reductions in c i and cre nals 
although credit quality asset metrics and trends  including those mentioned above  improved during  the economic environment in our markets remained weak and uncertain as reflected by continued stressed residential values  continued weakness in industrial employment in northern ohio and southeast michigan  and the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with limited sale or refinance activities 
residential real estate values continued to be negatively impacted by high unemployment  increased foreclosure activity  and the elimination of home buyer tax credits 
in the near term  we believe these factors will result in continued stress in our portfolios secured by residential real estate and an elevated level of ncos compared to historic levels 
during  the inflows of both new commercial criticized loans and new npas declined significantly compared with levels  however both have shown volatility during in the third quarter  inflows of both new commercial criticized loans and npas increased compared to the prior quarter 
although both of these levels declined in the fourth quarter from the third quarter  we believe this volatility evidences a fragile economic environment 
further  concerns continue to exist regarding the economic conditions in both national and international markets  the state of financial and credit markets  the unemployment rate  the impact of the federal reserve monetary policy  and continued uncertainty regarding federal  state  and local government budget deficits 
we do not anticipate any meaningful change in the overall economy in the near term 
all of these factors are impacting consumer confidence  as well as business investments and acquisitions 
given the combination of these factors  we believe that our acl coverage levels are appropriate

if the quality of a loan subsequently deteriorates  it migrates to a lower quality risk rating through our on going portfolio management process  and a higher reserve amount is assigned 
as a part of our on going portfolio management process for commercial loans  the loan is reviewed and reserves are increased or decreased as warranted 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
if the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan  a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher ncos as previously established reserves are utilized 
additionally  increases in reserves either precede or are in conjunction with increases in nals 
when a loan is classified as nal  it is evaluated for specific reserves or charge off 
as a result  an increase in nals may not necessarily result in an increase in reserves or an expectation of higher future ncos 
the significant million decline in total ncos reflected a combination of some economic stabilization  as well as the proactive credit management practices begun in these practices continued in  and remain on going 
the million decrease in non franklin related c i ncos reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio compared with the million decrease in cre ncos primarily reflected our proactive credit management practices begun in these practices continued in  and remain on going 
the million decline in automobile loans and leases reflected our consistent high quality of originations since the beginning of the focus on origination quality has been the primary driver for the improvement in this portfolio compared with the we believe the quality of the loans originated in will result in industry standard levels of ncos going forward as well 
non franklin related home equity ncos increased million reflecting the continuing stress to our borrowers associated with the fragile economy and the significant reduction of collateral equity since delinquencies continued to be driven by lower income resulting from job loss or reduced revenues for borrowers that are self employed 
frequently  first lien loans can be refinanced  however  there are limited financing options for second lien loans  particularly in situations when the collateral equity has lost value 
while we charge off loans in these situations  we generally do not forgive the debt  resulting in longer term opportunities for recoveries 
although ncos were higher compared with  early stage delinquency levels in the home equity line of credit portfolio declined  supporting our longer term positive view for the performance of the home equity portfolio 
we have been successful in originating new loans to higher quality borrowers  as evidenced by our home equity line of credit originations were current as of december  non franklin related residential mortgage ncos declined million 
this decline reflected a million sale of certain underperforming residential mortgage loans in that resulted in million of ncos  compared with a sale of million of similar loans resulting in million of ncos 
the remaining decrease in the non franklin related residential mortgage ncos compared with the prior year primarily reflected a combination of a general stabilization of home prices  as well as an increase in active loss mitigation activity 
the loan sale resulted in the elimination of loans with potential future credit losses and foreclosure expenses 
as we believe there will be no meaningful improvement in home prices in the foreseeable future  the selective reduction of underperforming loans is consistent with our moderate to low risk profile strategy 
available for sale and other securities portfolio this section should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates discussion  and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our available for sale and other securities portfolio is evaluated under established asset liability management objectives 
changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio  as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure 

table of contents our available for sale and other securities portfolio is comprised of various financial instruments 
at december   our available for sale and other securities portfolio totaled billion  an increase of billion from the duration of the portfolio increased by years as a result of the purchase of additional structured mortgage  municipal and corporate debt securities 
municipal securities comprise of the portfolio and consist primarily of general obligation and revenue bonds for essential services from different states 
the composition and maturity of the portfolio is presented on the following two tables

declines in the fair value of available for sale and other securities are recorded as temporary impairment  noncredit otti  or credit otti adjustments 
temporary impairment adjustments are recorded when the fair value of a security declines below its historical cost 
temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in oci  and reduce equity 
temporary impairment adjustments do not impact net income or risk based capital 
a recovery of available for sale security prices also is recorded as an adjustment to oci for securities that were previously temporarily impaired and results in an increase to equity 
because the available for sale and other securities portfolio is recorded at fair value  the determination that a security s decline in value is other than temporary does not significantly impact equity  as the amount of any of temporary adjustment has already been reflected in oci 
a recovery in the value of an other than temporarily impaired security is recorded as additional interest income over the remaining life of the security 
during  we recorded million of credit otti losses 
this amount was comprised of million related to pooled trust preferred securities  million related to cmo securities  and million related to alt a securities 
given the continued disruption in the housing and financial markets  we may be required to recognize additional credit otti losses in future periods with respect to our available for sale and other securities portfolio 
the amount and timing of any additional credit otti will depend on the decline in the 
table of contents underlying cash flows of the securities 
if our intent to hold temporarily impaired securities changes in future periods  we may be required to recognize noncredit otti through income  which will negatively impact earnings 
alt a  pooled trust preferred  and private label cmo securities our three highest risk segments of our investment portfolio are the alt a mortgage backed  pooled trust preferred  and private label cmo portfolios 
the alt a mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities are located within the asset backed securities portfolio 
the performance of the underlying securities in each of these segments continued to reflect the stressed economic environment 
each of these securities in these three segments is subjected to a rigorous review of their projected cash flows 
these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties 
see the investment securities section located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section for additional information

excess subordination percentage represents the additional defaults in excess of both current and projected defaults that the cdo can absorb before the bond experiences credit impairment 
excess subordinated percentage is calculated by a determining what percentage of defaults a deal can experience before the bond has credit impairment  and b subtracting from this default breakage percentage both total current and expected future default percentages 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities 
we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads  and expected lease residual values 
we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk 
interest rate risk overview interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reprice risk  changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from 
table of contents embedded options  such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity option risk  changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a non parallel fashion yield curve risk  and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves  such as us treasuries and libor basis risk 
our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk 
alco establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors policies 
in general  we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities 
our alco regularly monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors approved risk limits 
interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities 
effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business segment forecasts  management objectives  market expectations  and policy constraints 
an asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income  as rates earned on our interest earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  thus expanding our net interest margin 
conversely  a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income  as rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest earning assets  thus compressing our net interest margin 
income simulation and economic value analysis interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly 
two broad approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed income simulation and economic value analysis 
an income simulation analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net interest income to changes in market rates over a one year time period 
although bank owned life insurance  automobile operating lease assets  and excess cash balances held at the federal reserve bank are classified as noninterest earning assets  and the net revenue from these assets is recorded in noninterest income and noninterest expense  these portfolios are included in the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes similar to interest earning assets 
eve analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values of period end assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
eve analysis serves as a complement to income simulation modeling as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the one year simulation period 
the models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  and consumer installment loans  as well as cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the income simulation model 
the models include the effects of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors  and other types of interest rate options 
the baseline scenario for income simulation analysis  with which all other scenarios are compared  is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period end 
alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with the baseline scenario 
these alternative interest rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and an immediate basis  movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the yield curve eg  flatter or steeper yield curve  and no changes in current interest rates remaining unchanged for the entire measurement period 
scenarios are also developed to measure short term repricing risks  such as the impact of libor based interest rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate 
the simulations for evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure are scenarios that model gradual and basis points parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one year period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve 
we assumed market interest rates would not fall below over the next one year period for the scenarios that used the and basis points parallel shift in 
table of contents market interest rates 
the table below shows the results of the scenarios as of december   and december  all of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits 
table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  december  the net interest income at risk reported as of december  for the basis points scenario shows a change to a neutral near term interest rate risk position compared with december  the primary factors contributing to this change are the decline in market interest rates over the course of along with growth in deposits and net free funds  offset by increases in fixed rate loans and securities and updated model assumptions 
the following table shows the income sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates 
a portfolio with sensitivity would indicate that interest income and expense will change with the same magnitude and direction as interest rates 
a portfolio with sensitivity is insensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the basis points scenario  total interest sensitive income is sensitive to changes in market interest rates  while total interest sensitive expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
however  net interest income at risk for the basis points scenario has a neutral near term interest rate risk position because of the larger base of total interest sensitive income relative to total interest sensitive expense

the following table shows the economic value sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates 
the change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio 
for the basis points scenario  total net tangible assets decreased in value to changes in market interest rates  while total net tangible liabilities increased in value to changes in market interest rates 
eve at risk for the basis points scenario is liability sensitive because of the decrease in economic value of total net tangible assets  which reduces the eve  and the increase in economic value of total net tangible liabilities  which also reduces the eve

msr this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans 
of this million  million was recorded using the fair value method  and million was recorded using the amortization method 
if we actively engage in hedging  the msr asset is carried at fair value 
msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans  which can be greatly reduced by prepayments 
prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise 
we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or 
table of contents impairment 
in addition  we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes 
however  volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges 
we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income 
changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income 
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates  resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and  ultimately  impairment 
msr assets are included in other assets and presented in table price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting 
we have price risk from trading securities  securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries  foreign exchange positions  equity investments  investments in mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries 
we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio  the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained  and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us  such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company 
the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  and can maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances 
the alco was appointed by our board risk oversight committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish policies and limits based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  liquid asset coverage ratios  the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding  net cash capital  liquid assets  and emergency borrowing capacity 
in addition  operating guidelines are established to ensure that bank loans included in the business segments are funded with core deposits 
these operating guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by type  source  and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to cover of wholesale funds maturing within a six month period 
a contingency funding plan is in place  which includes forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages  including the implications of any credit rating changes and or other trigger events related to financial ratios  deposit fluctuations  debt issuance capacity  stock performance  or negative news related to us or the banking industry 
liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company  as well as its subsidiaries 
in addition  liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions  provide policy guidance  review funding strategies  and oversee the adherence to  and maintenance of  the contingency funding plans 
a contingency funding working group monitors daily cash flow trends  branch activity  unfunded commitments  significant transactions  and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of funds in order to identify areas of concern and establish specific funding strategies 
this group works closely with the alco and our communication team in order to identify issues that may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders  employees  and customers regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on our liquidity position 
in the normal course of business  in order to better manage liquidity risk  we perform stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods 
these credit ratings have a direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal  as well as adverse  circumstances 
the results of these stress tests indicate that at december   sufficient sources of funds were available to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations for the stress test scenarios include testing to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the national markets for funding  a significant run off in core deposits and liquidity triggers inherent 
table of contents in other financial agreements 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
the specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits  securitizing or selling loans  selling or maturing of securities  and extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings 
most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted in mid through with an improving trend during throughout and  we strengthened our liquidity position by significantly reducing noncore funds and wholesale borrowings  increasing liquid assets  and shifting from a net purchaser of overnight federal funds to holding an excess reserve position at the federal reserve bank 
the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding declined to by the end of from at year end 
during  the economy continued to stabilize and financial credit spreads tightened  resulting in a more liquid secondary market for our debt 
in addition  all three major rating agencies upgraded both the bank s and the parent company s credit ratings and or outlook resulting in a significantly lower rate on the million of subordinated debt issued in december of bank liquidity and sources of liquidity our primary sources of funding for the bank are retail and commercial core deposits 
as of december   these core deposits funded of total assets 
at december   total core deposits represented of total deposits  an increase from at the prior year end 
core deposits are comprised of interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits  money market deposits  savings and other domestic deposits  consumer certificates of deposit both over and under  and nonconsumer certificates of deposit less than  noncore deposits consist of brokered money market deposits and certificates of deposit  foreign time deposits  and other domestic deposits of  or more comprised primarily of public fund certificates of deposit more than  core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits  such as checking and savings account balances  are withdrawn 
we voluntarily began participating in the fdic s tagp in october of under this program  all noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction accounts with a rate of less than were fully guaranteed by the fdic for a customer s entire account balance 
in april of  the fdic adopted an interim rule extending the tagp through december   for financial institutions that desired to continue participating in the tagp

table of contents of subordinated notes due we used the net proceeds from these transactions to repurchase our tarp capital see capital section 
on january   we repurchased the warrant the company had issued to the treasury at an agreed upon purchase price of million 
the warrant had entitled the treasury to purchase million shares of common stock 
during  the parent company contributed billion of capital to the bank  which increased the bank s regulatory capital levels above its already well capitalized levels 
at december   the parent company had billion in cash and cash equivalents  compared with billion at december  the decrease primarily reflected the net impact of the equity and debt public offerings  the repurchase of our tarp capital  additional capital contributions made by the parent company to the bank  and dividend payments on our common and preferred stock 
appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses and other commitments during without relying on subsidiaries or capital markets for funding 
based on the current dividend of per common share  cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
based on the current dividend  cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
based on a regulatory dividend limitation  the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at december   without regulatory approval 
we do not anticipate that the bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build bank regulatory capital above its already well capitalized level 
to help meet any additional liquidity needs  we have an open ended  automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec  which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities 
with the exception of the common and preferred dividends previously discussed  the parent company does not have any significant cash demands 
there are no maturities of parent company obligations until  when a debt maturity of million is payable 
considering the factors discussed above  and other analyses that we have performed  we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold 
through our credit process  we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit 
when it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full  losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses 
at december   we had billion of standby letters of credit outstanding  of which were collateralized 
included in this billion total are letters of credit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company  our broker dealer subsidiary 
we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale 
at december   and december   we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of million and million  respectively 
these contracts mature in less than one year

operational risk as with all companies  we are subject to operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  and external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  and security risks 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws  rules  and regulations  and to improve the oversight of our operational risk 
to mitigate operational risks  we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal  regulatory  and compliance committee 
the responsibilities of these committees  among other duties  include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns  risks  or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues 
both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee 
additionally  potential concerns may be escalated to our board risk oversight committee  as appropriate 
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies  minimize operational and fraud losses  and enhance our overall performance 
representation and warranty reserve we primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with fannie mae and freddie mac 
in connection with these and other securitization transactions  we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria  such as collateral type and underwriting standards 
we may be required to repurchase individual loans and or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria 
we have a reserve for such losses  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the reserves were estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity  average loss rates  and current economic trends  including an increase in the amount of repurchase losses in recent quarters 

table of contents the table below reflects activity in the representations and warranties reserve for each of the last three years table summary of reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans serviced for others year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands reserve for representations and warranties  beginning of year acquired reserve for representations and warranties reserve charges provision for representations and warranties reserve for representations and warranties  end of year foreclosure documentation in light of recent announcements regarding alleged irregularities in the mortgage loan foreclosure processes of certain high volume loan servicers  state law enforcement authorities  the united states department of justice  and other federal agencies have stated they are investigating mortgage servicers foreclosure practices  and private litigation over such practices has begun to appear in the courts 
those investigations  as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of foreclosure processes and private litigation  could result in fines  penalties  damages  or other equitable remedies and result in significant legal costs in responding to possible governmental investigations and litigation 
compared to the high volume servicers  we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures  with approximately  foreclosure cases as of december   in states that require foreclosures to proceed through the courts 
in response to industry wide issues involving mortgage loan foreclosure irregularities  we conducted a review in october of our residential foreclosure process  focusing on the accuracy of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending foreclosure proceedings and the steps taken by us to ensure this documentation was properly reviewed and validated prior to filing the affidavit in the foreclosure proceeding 
as a result of our review  we have determined that we do not have any significant issues relating to so called robo signing  and that foreclosure affidavits were completed and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the contents of the affidavits 
there is no reason to conclude that foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed 
additionally  we have identified and are strengthening processes and controls to ensure that affidavits are prepared in compliance with applicable state law 
we consult with local foreclosure counsel  as necessary  with respect to additional requirements imposed by the courts in which foreclosure proceedings are pending 
compliance risk financial institutions are subject to a myriad of laws  rules and regulations emanating at both the federal and state levels 
these mandates cover a broad scope  including but not limited to  expectations on anti money laundering  lending limits  client privacy  fair lending  community reinvestment and other important areas 
recently  the volume and complexity of regulatory changes adds to the overall compliance risk 
at huntington  we take these mandates seriously and have invested in people  processes and systems to help ensure we meet expectations 
at the corporate level we have a team of compliance experts and lawyers dedicated to ensuring our conformance 
we provide  and require  training for our colleagues on a number of broad based laws and regulations 
for example  all of our employees are expected to take  and pass  courses on anti money laundering and customer privacy 
those who are engaged in lending activities must also take training related to flood disaster protection  equal credit opportunity  fair lending and or a variety of other courses related to the extension of credit 
we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance in this regard 

table of contents capital this section should be read in conjunction with significant items and  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
capital is managed both at the bank and on a consolidated basis 
capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit  market  liquidity  and operational risks inherent in our business  and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities 
shareholders equity totaled billion at december  this represented a billion decrease compared with december   primarily reflecting the repurchase of all million shares of tarp capital held by the treasury as part of our participation in the tarp cpp  offset by the million common stock issuance and earnings 
we believe our current level of capital is adequate 
tarp capital during  we received billion of equity capital by issuing to the treasury million shares of tarp capital and  a ten year warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price of per share 
upon receipt of the tarp capital in  the proceeds were allocated to the preferred stock and additional paid in capital 
during the period of time that we held the tarp capital  the resulting discount was amortized which resulted in additional dilution to our earnings per share 
the tarp capital was not a component of tier common equity 
in the fourth quarter  we issued million of common stock and million of subordinated notes due in the net proceeds of these issuances  along with other funds  were used to repurchase all billion of the tarp capital 
the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the tarp capital was accelerated  and a corresponding reduction to retained earnings of million was recorded 
subsequently  on january   we exited our tarp related relationship by repurchasing the ten year warrant we had issued to the treasury as part of the tarp cpp for million

these financial measures have been included as they are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength 
other companies may calculate these financial measures differently 
our consolidated tce ratio was at december   an increase from at december  the significant increase from december   primarily reflected the increased capital resulting from our million common stock issuance during the fourth quarter  and to a lesser extent  earnings 

table of contents regulatory capital regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks 
we intend to maintain both our and the bank s risk based capital ratios at levels at which both would be considered well capitalized by regulators 
the bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the occ  which establishes regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank holding companies by the federal reserve board 
regulatory capital primarily consists of tier capital and tier capital 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital equals our total risk based capital

the change in tier capital primarily reflected our billion subordinated debt issuance

no shares were repurchased during business segment discussion overview for detail on each segment s objectives  strategies  and priorities  please read this section in conjunction with the item business section 
this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective and should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance 
during the fourth quarter  we reorganized our business segments to better align certain business unit reporting with segment executives in order to accelerate cross sell results and provide greater focus on the execution of strategic plans 
we have four major business segments retail and business banking  commercial banking  automobile finance and commercial real estate  and wealth advisors  government finance  and home lending 
a treasury other function includes our insurance business  and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense 
all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification 

table of contents business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system  which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
funds transfer pricing we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments 
the intent of the ftp methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities 
the result is to centralize the financial impact  management  and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed 
the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment 
the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity liquidity premium 
deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an ftp credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates 
other assets  liabilities  and capital are charged credited with a four year moving average ftp rate 
the denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented 
revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service 
fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to  or providing service to  customers 
the most significant revenues for which fee sharing is allocated relate to customer derivatives and brokerage services  which are recorded by wgh and shared primarily with retail and business banking and commercial banking 
results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations 
expense allocation the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments 
expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach 
the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activity based costs to activities related to product origination and servicing 
these activity based costs are then extended  based on volumes  with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products 
the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other 
we utilize a full allocation methodology  where all treasury other expenses  except those related to our insurance business  servicing franklin related assets  reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment  and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses  are allocated to the four business segments 
treasury other the treasury other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business  and assets  liabilities  and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments 
assets include investment securities  bank owned life insurance  and the loans and oreo properties acquired through the first quarter franklin restructuring 
the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology  as described above  is also included 
net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity 
noninterest income includes insurance income  miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments  such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses 
noninterest expense includes any insurance related expenses  as well as certain corporate administrative  merger  and other miscellaneous expenses not 
table of contents allocated to other business segments 
the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory tax rate  though our overall effective tax rate is lower 
as a result  treasury other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments

net interest income increased million  or  primarily reflecting a basis point increase in the net interest margin  partially offset by a billion  or  decline in average total loans 
this increase in the net interest margin was almost entirely reflective of the basis point improvement in our commercial loan spread as a result of strategic pricing decisions 
average total loans declined billion  or  primarily reflecting paydowns  lower line of credit utilization 
we have experienced higher runoff in our commercial loan portfolio as many customers have actively reduced their leverage position

this decline in the cre portfolio was partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage ncos  partially reflecting ncos associated with loans sold during the current quarter 
other key credit quality measurements also showed improvement  including significant declines in npas and in the level of criticized commercial loans 
these declines reflected the positive impact of significant levels of loan restructures  upgrades  and payment activity

delinquency trends across the entire loan and lease portfolio continued to improve  with a significant opportunity for further improvement in the residential and home equity portfolios 
automobile loan delinquency rates continued to decline 
given the significant increase in new automobile origination volume  we use a lagged delinquency measure to ensure that the underlying portfolio performance is consistent with our expectations 
based on the lagged analysis and the origination quality  we remain comfortable with the on going performance of our automobile loan portfolio

current quarter cre ncos were million  or an annualized  down from million  or an annualized in the year ago quarter 
the decline was consistent with the improving asset quality metrics 
nals and criticized loans at december   were at their lowest levels since  and early stage delinquency continued to improve 
the fourth quarter cre ncos continued to be centered in retail projects 
the retail property portfolio remains the most susceptible to a continued decline in market conditions  but we believe that the combination of prior ncos and existing reserves positions us well to make effective credit decisions in the future 
while the office portfolio has experienced stress  we remain comfortable with this exposure 
total consumer ncos in the current quarter were million  or an annualized  down from million  or an annualized of average total consumer loans in the year ago quarter 
the fourth quarter results represented a continuation of our loss mitigation programs and active loss recognition processes 
this included accounts in all stages of performance  including bankruptcy 

table of contents residential mortgage ncos were million  or an annualized of related average balances  an increase compared with million  or an annualized in the year ago quarter 
during the current quarter  we continued to see positive trends in early stage delinquencies  indicating that even with the economic stress on our customers  losses are expected to remain manageable 
home equity ncos in the fourth quarter were million  or an annualized 
this was down from million  or an annualized  in the year ago quarter 
we continued to manage the default rate through focused delinquency monitoring as virtually all defaults for second lien home equity loans incur substantial losses given the reduced collateral equity 
our strategies focus on loss mitigation activity through early intervention and restructuring loan terms 
automobile loan and lease ncos were million  or an annualized  down from million  or an annualized  in the year ago quarter 
performance of this portfolio on both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent with our views regarding the underlying quality of the portfolio 
during the fourth quarter  we originated million of loans with an average fico score of with a continued emphasis on lower ltv ratios 
npas and nals total nals were million at december   and represented of total loans and leases 
this was down  million  or  from  million  or  of total loans and leases at the end of the year ago period 
this decrease primarily reflected problem loan resolution activity and ncos 
this substantial decline is a direct result of our commitment to the on going proactive management of these loans by our sad 
also key to this improvement was the lower level of inflows 
the level of inflows  or migration  is an important indicator of the future trend for the portfolio 
npas  which include nals  were million at december   and represented of total loans and leases 
this was significantly lower than  million  or of related assets at the end of the year ago period 
the  million decrease in npas from the end of the year ago period reflected a  million decrease in nals 
the over day delinquent  but still accruing  ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a us government agency  was at december   representing a basis point decline compared with december  this decrease primarily reflected continued improvement in our core performance  as well as the impact of the sale of certain underperforming loans in the fourth quarter 
acl this section should be in read in conjunction with note and note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the alll was  million  down million  or  from  million at december  expressed as a percent of period end loans and leases  the alll ratio at december   was  a decline from at december  the alll as a percent of nals was at december   a substantial improvement from at at december   the aulc was million  down million  or  compared with december  on a combined basis  the acl as a percent of total loans and leases at december   was  down from at december  this reduction was centered in the cre portfolio as a result of the reduction in the level of problem loans 
the acl as a percent of nals was at december   up from at december   indicating additional strength in the reserve level relative to the level of problem loans

critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference into this md a  describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time  and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 
total allowance for credit losses our acl of billion at december   represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we periodically review our acl for adequacy 
in doing so  we consider economic conditions and trends  collateral values  and credit quality indicators  such as past nco experience  levels of past due loans  and npas 
there is no certainty that our acl will be adequate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy  market conditions  or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries  or markets 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates  the risk profile of a market  industry  or group of customers changes materially  or if the acl is not adequate  our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which  in turn  could have a material negative adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs 
any increase in our acl or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
we estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods 
where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices  quoted market prices are used for fair value 
we characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing 
table of contents information  with reasonably narrow bid ask spreads  and where received quoted prices do not vary widely 
when the financial instruments are not actively traded  other observable market inputs  such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics  may be used  if available  to determine fair value 
inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes  price quotations that vary substantially among market participants  or in which minimal information is released publicly 
when observable market prices do not exist  we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods 
our valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and  for the derivatives portfolio  counterparty credit risk 
other factors such as model assumptions  market dislocations  and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value 
changes in these underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale  available for sale and other certain securities  certain securitized automobile loans  derivatives  certain msrs  trading account securities  and certain securitization trust notes payable 
at december   approximately billion of our assets and billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value 
in addition to the above mentioned on going fair value measurements  fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements  establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date 
the three levels are defined as follows level quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
financial instruments are considered level when values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
at the end of each quarter  we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured 
as necessary  assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date 

table of contents the table below provides a description and the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy  as well as additional discussion regarding fair value measurements  can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financial instrument hierarchy valuation methodology mortgage loans held for sale level huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale 
mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using security prices for similar product types 
at december   mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate fair value of million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
interest income on these loans is recorded in interest and fee income loans and leases 
included in mortgage banking income were net gains resulting from origination and sale of these loans  including net realized gains of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
of such gains  the change in fair value while held as loans were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
available for sale securities trading account securities level consist primarily of us treasury and money market mutual funds  which generally have quoted prices 
level consist of us government and agency mortgage backed and other federal agency securities  municipal securities  and other securities for which an active market is not available 
third party pricing services provide a fair value estimate based upon trades of similar financial instruments 
level consist of certain asset backed securities  pooled trust preferred securities  private label cmos  and municipal securities for which fair value is estimated 
assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market transactions 
generally  there are only limited trades of similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used to determine fair value 
automobile loans level consists of automobile loan receivables measured at fair value 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads 
the net gains and losses  before tax  from fair value changes reflected in earnings for the year ended december  was a net loss of million which is net of a million net gain associated with instrument specific credit risk 
instrument specific credit risk was determined based on estimated credit losses inherent in the january  fair value calculation as compared to actual credit losses incurred in plus estimated credit losses inherent in the december  fair value calculation 

table of contents financial instrument hierarchy valuation methodology msrs level msrs do not trade in an active  open market with readily observable prices 
although sales of msrs do occur  the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available 
fair value is determined on an income approach model based upon month end interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions 
derivatives level consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgage backed securities which are valued using quoted prices 
level consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and options  and interest rate caps 
these derivative positions are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates 
level consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments 
the determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan  which is a significant unobservable assumption 
securitization trust notes payable level consists of certain securitization trust notes payable related to the automobile loans measured at fair value 
the notes payable are valued based on interest rates for similar financial instruments 
the change in fair value for the year ended december  was million

investment securities this section should be read in conjunction with the investment securities portfolio discussion and note and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
level analysis on certain securities portfolios our alt a  private label cmo  and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as level  and as such  the significant estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity 
the alt a and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows  while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly 
these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties  and are used as a basis for impairment analysis 
these three portfolios  and the results of our impairment analysis for each portfolio  are discussed in further detail below alt a mortgage backed private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities represent securities collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans 
as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a level input  we classified all securities within these portfolios as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the securities were priced with the assistance of an outside third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and the independent third party s proprietary pricing model 
the model used inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds  losses  recoveries  and default rates that were implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures  discount rates that were implied by market prices for similar securities  collateral structure types  and housing price depreciation appreciation rates that were based upon macroeconomic forecasts 

table of contents we analyzed both our alt a mortgage backed and private label cmo securities portfolios to determine if the securities in these portfolios were other than temporarily impaired 
we used the analysis to determine whether we believed it was probable that all contractual cash flows would not be collected 
all securities in these portfolios remained current with respect to interest and principal  except for one security which experienced a minor interest shortfall at december  our analysis indicated that  as of december   one alt a mortgage backed security and seven private label cmo securities could experience a loss of principal in the future 
the future expected losses of principal on these other than temporarily impaired securities ranged from to of their par value 
these losses were projected to occur anywhere from eight months to as many as years in the future 
we measured the amount of credit impairment on these securities using the cash flows discounted at each security s effective rate 
in  a total of million of credit otti was recorded in our alt a mortgage backed securities portfolio  and million of credit otti was recorded in our private label cmo securities portfolio 
these otti adjustments negatively impacted our earnings 
pooled trust preferred securities represent cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions 
as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a level input  we classified all securities within this portfolio as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the collateral generally consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks  bank holding companies  and insurance companies 
a full cash flow analysis was used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio 
impairment was calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the amount of cash flows discounted at each security s effective rate 
we engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio 
relying on cash flows was necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities were no longer able to provide a fair value 
the analysis was completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooled trust preferred security in the portfolio  including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in each security and terms of each security s structure 
the credit review included analysis of profitability  credit quality  operating efficiency  leverage  and liquidity using the most recently available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer 
we also reviewed historical industry default data and current near term operating conditions 
using the results of our analysis  we estimated appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral and then estimated the expected cash flows for each security 
no recoveries were assumed on issuers who are in default 
the recovery assumptions on issuers who were deferring interest ranged from to with a cure assumed after the maximum deferral period 
as a result of this testing  we believe we will likely experience a loss of principal or interest on nine securities and  as such  recorded credit otti of million for one newly impaired and eight previously impaired pooled trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter 
in  million of total otti was recorded for impairment of the pooled trust preferred securities 
these otti adjustments negatively impacted our earnings 
please refer to the securities discussion and note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding otti 
certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial instruments also involve fair value measurements 
a description of these assets and liabilities  and the methodologies utilized to determine fair value are discussed below goodwill goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire the assets of another company 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  as of october  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying 
table of contents value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis  using the same two step process as the annual testing  if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in  we performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at march and june  as well as our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of october the annual assessment was based on our reporting units at that time 
no impairment was recorded in the interim and annual assessments were performed in a manner consistent with the process as described in the next section 
all assumptions were updated to reflect correct market conditions 
due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties  it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future 
if our market capitalization decreases or the liquidity discount on our loan portfolio improves significantly without a concurrent increase in market capitalization  we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time  if any changes constitute a triggering event 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
first quarter impairment testing during the first quarter  our stock price declined  from per common share at december   to per common share at march  many peer banks also experienced similar significant declines in market capitalization during this same period 
this decline primarily reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions  as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention 
we determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts 
therefore  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the first quarter 
an independent third party was engaged to assist with the impairment assessment 
the first step step of impairment testing required a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to carrying value to identify potential impairment 
for our impairment testing conducted during the first quarter  we identified four reporting units regional banking  private financial group pfg  insurance  and automobile finance and dealer services afds 
although insurance was included within pfg for business segment reporting at that time  it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions 
the fair value of pfg determined using the market approach as described below  excluding insurance  exceeded its carrying value  and goodwill was determined to not be impaired for this reporting unit 
there was no goodwill associated with afds and  therefore  it was not subject to impairment testing 
for regional banking  we utilized both the income and market approaches to determine fair value 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity 
an internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at 
the discount rate of was estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considered the risk free interest rate year treasury bonds  market risk premium  equity risk premium  and a company specific risk factor 
the company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management 
for the market approach  revenue  earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to the regional banking unit s applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values 
a control premium was used in the market approach 
the results of the income and market approaches were weighted and 
table of contents  respectively  to arrive at the final calculation of fair value 
as market capitalization declined across the banking industry  we believed that a heavier weighting on the income approach was more representative of a market participant s view 
for the insurance reporting unit  management utilized a market approach to determine fair value 
the aggregate fair market values were compared with market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements 
as our stock price fluctuated greatly during the valuation period  we used our average stock price for the days preceding the valuation date to determine market capitalization 
the aggregate fair market values of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 
a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place 
neither the regional banking nor insurance reporting units passed step the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
to determine the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of regional banking and insurance as determined in step was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the reporting units including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets 
the allocation was done as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
this allocation process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities other than goodwill  as appropriate were not adjusted nor were any new intangible assets recorded 
key valuations were the assessment of core deposit intangibles  the mark to fair value of outstanding debt and deposits  and mark to fair value on the loan portfolio 
core deposits were valued using a discount rate 
the marks on our outstanding debt and deposits were based upon observable trades or modeled prices using then current yield curves and market spreads 
the valuation of the loan portfolio indicated discounts in the ranges of  depending upon the loan type 
the estimated fair value of these loan portfolios was based on an exit price  and the assumptions used were intended to approximate those that a market participant would have used in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction  including a market liquidity discount 
the significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the current distressed market conditions was a significant contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these loans 
we believed these discounts were consistent with transactions currently occurring in the marketplace 
upon completion of step  we determined that the regional banking and insurance reporting units goodwill carrying values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by  million and million  respectively 
as a result  we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of  million in the first quarter 
other interim and annual impairment testing we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter related to the sale of a small payments related business completed in july no other goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of franklin loans restructuring transaction this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in servicing performing  reperforming  and nonperforming residential mortgage loans 
prior to march   franklin owned a portfolio of loans secured by first lien and second lien loans secured by residential properties 
these loans generally fell outside the underwriting standards of fannie mae or freddie mac  and involved elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation  limited credit histories  higher levels of consumer debt  and or past credit difficulties nonprime loans 
at december   our total commercial loans outstanding to franklin were million  all of which were placed on nonaccrual status 
additionally  the 
table of contents specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the franklin portfolio was million  resulting in net exposure to franklin at december   of million 
on march   we entered into a transaction with franklin whereby a huntington wholly owned reit subsidiary reit indirectly acquired an ownership right in a trust which held all the underlying consumer loans and oreo properties that were formerly collateral for the franklin commercial loans 
the equity interests provided to franklin by the reit were pledged by franklin as collateral for the franklin commercial loans 
as a result of the restructuring  on a consolidated basis  the million nonaccrual commercial loan to franklin at december   was no longer reported 
instead  the loans were reported as secured by first lien and second lien mortgages on residential properties and oreo properties both of which had previously been assets of franklin or its subsidiaries and were pledged to secure our loan to franklin 
at the time of the restructuring  these loans had a fair value of million and the oreo properties had a fair value of million 
as a result of the restructuring  we reported million mortgage related nals outstanding related to franklin  representing first lien and second lien mortgages that were nonaccruing at december  also  our specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the franklin portfolio of million was eliminated 
however  no initial increase to the alll relating to the acquired mortgages was recorded as these assets were recorded at fair value 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million related to the difference between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets 
because the acquisition price  represented by the equity interests in our wholly owned subsidiary  was equal to the fair value of the acquired ownership right  no goodwill was created from the transaction 
the recording of the net deferred tax asset was a bargain purchase under asc  and was recorded as a tax benefit in the first quarter 
during the second quarter  million of franklin related loans million of residential mortgages and million of home equity loans at a value of million were transferred to loans held for sale 
at the time of the transfer to loans held for sale  the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less anticipated selling costs 
during the third quarter  the franklin related residential mortgages and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value 
at december   the only franklin related assets remaining were million of oreo properties  which have been marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
additionally  the equity interests in the reit held by franklin remain outstanding and pledged as collateral for the franklin commercial loans at december  pension pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and our common stock 
investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value 
mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value 
our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both assumptions 
actual results may be materially different 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other real estate owned oreo property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the property s appraised value at the date of transfer  with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the alll 
subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are charged to noninterest expense 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of oreo are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale 
at december   oreo totaled million  representing a decrease compared with million at december  
table of contents income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
we have two accruals for income taxes our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal  state  and local taxing jurisdictions  net of any reserve for potential audit issues  and is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  our deferred federal income tax asset  reported as a component of accrued income and other assets  represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap  and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code 
in the ordinary course of business  we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes 
the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws 
we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions 
in addition  we rely on various tax opinions  recent tax audits  and historical experience
