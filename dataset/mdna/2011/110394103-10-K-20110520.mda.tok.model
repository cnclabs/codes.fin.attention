executive overview this executive overview only includes what management considers to be the most important information and analysis for evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
it provides the context for the discussion and analysis of the financial statements which follow and does not disclose every item impacting our financial condition and operating performance 
see discussion of our business and the operations within our helicopter services segment under part i 
item business overview included elsewhere in this annual report 
our strategy our goal is to strengthen our position as a leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following well defined business commercial and capital allocation strategies to achieve this goal business commercial strategy be the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our business to be the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our clients and providing safe and high quality service 
in order to create further differentiation and add value to our clients  we are expanding our well established and successful global target zero safety program to also focus on additional areas related to maximizing uptime and service levels 
the new expanded program called target zero accidents  target zero downtime and target zero complaints is designed to deliver continuous improvement in all these important areas and demonstrate bristow s commitment to providing higher hours of zero accident flight time with on time and up time helicopter transportation service 
we maintain relationships with our clients field operations and corporate management which we believe helps us better anticipate client needs and provide our clients with 
table of contents the right aircraft in the right place at the right time 
this in turn allows us to better manage our fleet utilization and capital investment program 
we also leverage our close relationships with our clients to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standardized first rate operating and safety practices across our global operations  we seek to provide our clients with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding and delivering on our clients needs with our global operations and safety standards  we believe we successfully compete against other helicopter service providers based on aircraft availability  client service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
grow our business while managing our assets 
we plan to continue to grow our business globally and increase our revenue and profitability over time  while managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
we conduct flight operations in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  and through our strong relationships with our existing clients  we are aware of future business opportunities in the markets we currently serve that would allow us to grow through new contracts 
we anticipate these new opportunities will result in the deployment of new or existing aircraft into markets where we expect they will earn desirable rates of return 
additionally  new opportunities may result in growth through acquisitions and investments in existing or new markets  which may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates  investing in new companies  or creating partnerships and alliances with existing industry participants 
we believe the combination of growth in existing and new markets will deliver improved shareholder returns 
capital allocation strategy our capital allocation strategy is based on three principles as follows logo prudent balance sheet management 
throughout our corporate and business unit management  we proactively manage our capital allocation plan with a concentration on achieving business growth and improving rates of return  within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management 
we have funded our successful growth plan and maintained adequate liquidity by raising approximately billion of debt and equity by means of both public and private financings since fiscal year  and we intend to continue managing our capital structure and liquidity position relative to our commitments with external financings when necessary 
in november  we increased our liquidity by million with our credit facilities 
our debt to total capitalization ratio and total liquidity were and million  respectively  and and million  respectively  as of march  and highest return of bva 
we have implemented a new internal financial management framework we call bristow value added bva to enhance our focus on the returns we deliver across our organization 
bva is computed by subtracting a capital charge for the use of gross invested capital from after tax operating cash flow 
our goal is to achieve strong improvements in bva over time by improving the returns we earn throughout our organization via cost and capital efficiency improvements as well as through better pricing based on the differentiated value we deliver to customers via aircraft safety  availability  client service and reliability  deploying more capital into commercial opportunities where management believes we can deliver strong returns  and withdrawing capital from areas where returns are deemed inadequate and unable to be sufficiently improved 
in addition to internal investment  we will  when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders  make strategic acquisitions or make strategic equity investments 
when appropriate  we may divest parts of the company 
improvements in bva will also be the primary financial measure in our management incentive plan to align the interests of management with shareholders 

table of contents balanced shareholder return 
we have invested billion on capital expenditures to grow our business since fiscal year while we plan to continue to invest in new aircraft  we do not expect capital expenditures to continue at this level over the near term 
we believe our liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be more than adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures  so we have considered our capital deployment alternatives for the future to deliver a more balanced return to our shareholders 
on may   our board of directors approved a dividend 
we also explore other options on an ongoing basis such as buying back our common stock or paying special dividends from time to time when we have excess cash 
market outlook our core business is providing helicopter services to the worldwide oil and gas industry 
our clients operating expenditures in the production sector are the principal source of our revenue  while their exploration and development capital expenditures provide a lesser portion of our revenue 
our clients typically base their capital expenditure budgets on their long term commodity price expectations and not exclusively on the current spot price 
in  the credit  equity and commodity markets were quite volatile causing many of our oil and gas company clients to reduce capital spending plans and defer projects 
during and thus far in  oil prices ranged from approximately to per barrel and access to capital improved significantly 
growing confidence among our clients has led to increased capital expenditure budgets resulting in some larger projects moving ahead that were previously on hold 
this has led to the recovery in our fiscal year financial performance 
while we are cautiously optimistic that the economic conditions will continue to recover in fiscal year  we continue to seek ways to reduce costs and work with our clients to improve the efficiency of their operations 
our global operations and critical mass of helicopters provide us with geographic and client diversity which helps mitigate risks associated with a single market or client 
this economic recovery should lead to an accelerated expansion in fiscal year and beyond and increased demand in many of our core markets 
the limited availability of some new aircraft models and the need throughout the industry to retire many of the older aircraft in the worldwide fleet is a driver for our industry 
currently manufacturers have some available aircraft  however  there are some constraints on supply of new large aircraft 
the aftermarket for sales of our aircraft is recovering and sale prices have improved  reflecting buyers with available capital 
brazil continues to represent a significant part of our positive growth outlook 
the recent discovery of pre salt deepwater fields in brazil along with the national mandate to significantly increase its production over the next five years will necessitate investment in infrastructure and associated services 
as a result  we anticipate and have begun to enjoy growth in both international oil companies and petrobras activity as they ramp up their procurement of helicopters services 
during and  petrobras procured large aircraft as they renewed their fleet and added incremental capacity in this category 
since then  they have issued a requirement for a further five large aircraft 
further  petrobras has recently issued a tender for over medium sized aircraft of which a significant portion could be incremental capacity 
aircraft being procured in this market tend to be newer and more sophisticated which fits with both bristow and l der s market positioning and fleet plans 
we believe this growth trend will continue over the next five years to keep pace with brazil s national production policies 
as discussed in item a 
risk factors in this annual report  we are subject to competition and the political environment in the countries where we operate 
in one of these markets  nigeria  we have seen a recent increase in competitive pressure and new regulation that could impact our ability to win future work at levels previously anticipated 
during fiscal year  in both nigeria and australia we had major clients re bid contracts that we were incumbents on and award these contracts to competitors 
the contract in nigeria provided us with annualized revenue of approximately million and ended in fiscal year the contract in australia provided us with annualized revenue of approximately million and ends in fiscal year despite the current competitive environments in these markets as well as the regulatory environment in nigeria  we expect the lost revenue to eventually be offset by new contract awards with other clients and increased ad hoc flying in these regions 

table of contents we conduct business in various foreign countries  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations and related risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
throughout fiscal year  our primary foreign currency exposure was related to the euro  the british pound sterling and the australian dollar 
for details on this exposure and the related impact on our results of operations  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 
the management of our global aircraft fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for helicopter services across global oil and gas markets  including the type of aircraft needed to meet this demand 
as offshore oil and gas drilling and production globally moves to deeper water  more medium and large aircraft and newer technology aircraft may be required 
as older aircraft models come off of current contracts and are replaced by new aircraft  our management evaluates our future needs for these aircraft models and ultimately the ability to recover our remaining investments in these aircraft through sales into the aftermarket 
we depreciate our aircraft over their expected useful life to the expected salvage value to be received for the aircraft at the end of that life  however  depending on the market for aircraft we may record gains or losses on aircraft sales 
in certain instances where a cash return can be made on newer aircraft in excess of the expected return available through the provision of helicopter services  we may sell newer aircraft 
the number of aircraft sales and the amount of gains and losses recorded on these sales is unpredictable 
while aircraft sales are common in our business and are reflected in our operating results  gains and losses on aircraft sales may result in our operating results not reflecting the ordinary operating performance of our primary business  which is providing helicopter services to our clients

fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in gross revenue is due to increased revenue across all of our primary business units largely as a result of the addition of new contracts  increases in rates on existing contracts and a favorable impact of exchange rate changes in australia and an increase in reimbursable revenue  which was partially offset by the impact of reduced activity for certain clients  an unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes in europe and a decrease in revenue from bristow academy due to a delay in military training

europe fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net operating margin flight hours gross revenue for europe increased  despite a slight decrease in flight hours  as a result of new contracts and an increase in reimbursable revenue 
two new contracts were added since the prior fiscal year contributing to a shift toward larger aircraft in this market 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by an unfavorable change in exchange rates and short term work provided in the prior fiscal year to a client in the north sea that resulted in increased flight hours in that period 
operating expense for europe increased due to an increase in salaries  fuel and travel expenses as a result of the new contracts added in this market 
additionally  depreciation expense increased in fiscal year as fiscal year included a correction of prior period errors of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in maintenance expense due to fewer heavy maintenance charges and the impact of changes in exchange rates 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses includes earnings from our equity investment in fbs limited  fb heliservices limited and fb leasing limited  and increased primarily due to a favorable change in exchange rates 
operating margin improved primarily due to the addition of new contracts and increased equity earnings

table of contents gross revenue for west africa increased primarily due to new contracts  rate escalations under existing contracts and a reduction in aircraft maintenance delays partially offset by reduced activity on some contracts and loss of a major contract during fiscal year additionally  reimbursable revenue decreased due to a decrease in training and duty recharges that were rebilled to a client during the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating expense was primarily a result of an increase in maintenance expense and an increase in freight charges due to the mobilization of two aircraft to this market 
additionally  we incurred million more in employee severance costs in fiscal year versus fiscal year as a result of the loss of a major contract during fiscal year these increases were offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits due to headcount reductions and a decrease in reimbursable expense 
also in fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of obsolete inventory 
operating margin decreased primarily due to the loss of a major contract  increase in maintenance expense and freight charges partially offset by decreases in other expenses  including salaries and benefits 
we have seen recent changes in this market as a result of increased competition

north america fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours gross revenue for north america increased primarily due to additional work from bp in support of the deepwater horizon spill control and monitoring effort and rate increases on certain existing contracts partially offset by reduced activity from the ongoing impact of the oil spill and the subsequent drilling moratoria in the us gulf of mexico 
the increase in operating expense was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and benefits  fuel and maintenance costs due to the change in aircraft type utilized 
the increase in operating margin from fiscal year is primarily due to an increase in rates driven by the change in the mix of aircraft flying in this market 

table of contents australia fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours gross revenue for australia increased primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates and an increase in flight hours as a result of changes in aircraft on contract from fiscal year we have introduced new aircraft since the prior year resulting in a change of revenue mix 
additionally  reimbursable revenue increased as a result of fixed wing recharges billed to a client in fiscal year operating expense increased primarily due to the impact of changes in exchange rates and an increase in salaries and benefits due to the increase in activity  annual salary increases and subsequent increases in the annual leave and long service leave provisions 
during fiscal year  we reversed costs previously accrued in fiscal year for tax items as favorable rulings were obtained from the tax authorities 
excluding the reversal of these tax items  operating margin would have been in fiscal year operating margin declined from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the increase in salaries and benefits in fiscal year and reversal of tax items in fiscal year during fiscal year  a major client re bid a contract we were the incumbent on and awarded this contract to a competitor

operating expense increased primarily due to an increase in costs in russia  brazil and mexico increased maintenance costs and the baltic sea and suriname new contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expense as we no longer operate in kazakhstan and administrative costs decreased 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses primarily increased due to an increase in earnings from our investment in l der of million from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses along with increased activity in brazil resulted in the increase in operating margin from fiscal year on january   we entered into an equity interest purchase and sale agreement the equity agreement with controladora de servicios aeronauticos  sa de sa cicsa and rotorwing financial services  inc rfs  the owner of the other of heliservicio and the owner of the other of rlr  respectively 
through this agreement  we and our partners agreed that cicsa would purchase our remaining interest in heliservicio 
additionally  concurrent with the sale of our interest in heliservicio  we would execute our option to purchase the interest in rlr owned by rfs 
we anticipate this transaction will close by june  this transaction will result in us having no ownership interest in heliservicio and full ownership of rlr 
our ownership interest in heliservicio will transfer to cicsa for no proceeds  resulting in the impairment of our investment of million  which we have recognized as of march  we will acquire the remaining interest in rlr for million 

table of contents the equity agreement included provisions for the settlement of past due amounts including past due accounts receivable due from heliservicio to us and settlement of other matters 
as part of this agreement  on january   we received a net payment from heliservicio of million that was applied to outstanding accounts receivable and wrote off million of previously reserved accounts receivable due from heliservicio 
we previously provided an indemnity agreement to afianzadora sofimex  sa to support the issuance of surety bonds on behalf of heliservicio from time to time 
the equity agreement also provided for our release from these guarantees and we were fully released from these guarantees on march  we will continue to lease aircraft from rlr and other consolidated subsidiaries to heliservicio under revised lease agreements 
as of april  we no longer provide maintenance and support to heliservicio 
these arrangements returned a low operating margin and we expect our operating margins to improve without these arrangements in fiscal year we currently have approximately million of inventory supporting the fleet of aircraft operated by heliservicio in mexico  of which approximately million is in mexico with the remainder in transit to mexico or at our maintenance facilities in the us we expect to recover the value of this inventory either through use in heliservicio s operations  consumption elsewhere in the bristow group fleet  in support of other operator s fleets or through sale of the inventory to third parties 
however  if certain events do not occur as expected  it is possible that a partial impairment of the inventory may be necessary 
we estimate the range of potential loss to be million to million

taxes fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages effective tax rate net foreign tax on non us earnings benefit of foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad expense from change in tax contingency release of deferred tax liability due to restructure percentage change not meaningful the effective income tax rate for fiscal year reflects the tax implications of the implementation of a restructuring that more closely aligns our legal structure with our global operational structure 
as a result of this restructuring  which was effective november   most us tax on offshore profits will be deferred until the profits are repatriated 

table of contents during fiscal year  we recorded a net reduction of our provision for income taxes of million  primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax balances recorded in prior fiscal years 
because offshore profits will be deferred until the profits are repatriated  deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior fiscal years are no longer required 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year included the impact of an increase in tax expense resulting from tax contingency items and changes in our expected foreign tax credit utilization 
excluding these items  our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year as a result of the corporate restructuring  which increased the earnings reported as permanently reinvested outside the us for further discussion of income taxes  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense is primarily due to a decline in the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage as we acquired an additional interest in rlr in january see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under results of operations above 
europe fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net operating margin flight hours gross revenue and flight hours for europe increased primarily as a result of a full year of results from bristow norway which we began consolidating effective october   which resulted in an increase of million and  hours  respectively  ad hoc flying in the north sea and an increase in out of pocket costs rebilled to our clients reimbursable revenue 
the impact of these improvements was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates and a lower level of contractual escalation billings in fiscal year operating expense for europe increased primarily due to the consolidation of bristow norway million 
the increase in operating expense was partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates 
additionally  operating expense decreased in fiscal year as a result of correcting prior period errors million relating to depreciation expense 
operating margin decreased due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates as well as the inclusion of bristow norway for a full year as bristow norway had a lower operating margin than the rest of the europe business unit 
west africa fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours flight hours for west africa decreased as a result of a decrease in demand for aircraft in this market by certain existing clients  partially offset by the addition of new contracts and ad hoc work 
despite the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue increased due to rate escalations under existing contracts and higher rates earned on new contracts and on ad hoc flying 

table of contents the increase in operating expense was primarily a result of increases in salaries and benefits  maintenance and insurance expense 
also  during fiscal year we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of obsolete inventory 
the increase in operating expense was partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates 
excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates  the operating margin for west africa was in fiscal year  which was slightly improved over fiscal year due to rate escalations under existing contracts and higher rates earned on new contracts and ad hoc work 
north america fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue and operating expense is primarily due to the gom asset sale as well as an overall decline in the demand for aircraft in this market resulting from decreased drilling activity 
the gom asset sale resulted in a decrease in revenue and flight hours of million and  respectively 
additionally  both revenue and operating expense decreased as a result of a decrease in fuel costs  which are generally recovered from our clients  due to a combination of a decrease in fuel price and lower flight hours 
operating margin deteriorated due to the decline in demand in this market 
australia fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense operating margin flight hours flight hours for australia decreased due to a decrease in activity in this market since fiscal year despite the decrease in flight hours  gross revenue increased due to a shift to larger aircraft on contract  some of which were new aircraft earning higher rates  a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates and an increase in reimbursable revenue 
operating expense decreased primarily due to decreased activity and cost reduction initiatives including decreases in maintenance  fuel and travel expenses 
operating expense also decreased as a result of the reversal of costs previously accrued in fiscal year for tax items as favorable rulings were obtained from the tax authorities on these matters during fiscal year during fiscal year  we incurred salary  maintenance and other costs on aircraft that were not fully operational as a result of delays in planned contracts  unscheduled maintenance and re positioning of aircraft 
operating margin improved due to both an increase in aircraft on contract  some of which were new aircraft earning higher rates  and the decrease in costs discussed above 
other international fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages and flight hours gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net operating margin flight hours 
table of contents gross revenue and flight hours decreased primarily due to our exit from mauritania  kazakhstan  peru and colombia and decreased activity in trinidad  partially offset by an increase in activity in libya due to a new contract  mexico due to an increase in rates and activity and brazil due to aircraft maintenance support provided on aircraft in brazil 
operating expense increased due an increase to the bad debt allowance of million in mexico and the inclusion in fiscal year of million in escalation charges to a client in russia  partially offset by increases in brazil due to million of earnings generated from our investment in l der in fiscal year  kazakhstan due to a reversal of million of bad debt expense and libya due to a new contract 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses  decreased as fiscal year included earnings of million from our investment in l der on may  while fiscal year included million in equity earnings due to collection of past due receivables by rlr see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in mexico and egypt were not substantially changed from fiscal year to fiscal year equity in earnings from our investment in l der included million attributable to foreign currency transaction gains 
as a result of the expiration of our partner s aircraft operating certificate in kazakhstan in mid october  we removed our two aircraft from this market 
neither we nor our partner in kazakhstan are operating in this market  which resulted in a reduction in revenue 
during fiscal year  we had revenue from our operations in kazakhstan totaling million and operating income totaling million including million of reversal of bad debt allowance versus million of revenue and million of operating income in fiscal year corporate and other fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages gross revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses operating loss percentage change not meaningful gross revenue increased due to increased revenue at bristow academy as a result of increased military training and the acquisition of additional training aircraft  partially offset by a decrease in technical services revenue due to timing of part sales 
operating expense increased due to increases in corporate and bristow academy 
corporate operating expense increased from fiscal year due to million of compensation costs from the departure of three officers during fiscal year and higher expense recorded for incentive compensation during fiscal year operating expense increased at bristow academy primarily due to increased business volume as well as costs of operating additional aircraft 
the operating margin improved for bristow academy from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due to the fact that the military training contracts yield a higher margin of return 
interest expense  net fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages interest income interest expense amortization of debt discount amortization of debt fees capitalized interest interest expense  net 
table of contents interest income decreased as a result of lower interest rates generally  a decrease in cash invested during fiscal year and our shift from higher yielding investments to lower yielding investments in response to financial market conditions

taxes fiscal year ended march  favorable unfavorable in thousands  except percentages effective tax rate for continuing operations net foreign tax on non us earnings benefit of foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad expense from change in tax contingency tax expense on gom asset sale percentage change not meaningful our effective tax rate for fiscal year and fiscal year was reduced by the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided  and by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in noncontrolling interest expense is primarily due to decreases in income from rlr of million and a russian subsidiary of million during fiscal year see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

in addition to the gom asset sale  we received proceeds of million primarily from the disposal of aircraft and certain other equipment  which together resulted in a net gain of million  and recorded a million loss related to non recoverable deductibles under our insurance policies for hurricane damage 

table of contents on october   our then equity method investee  norsk helikopter as norsk  distributed of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary  lufttransport as  to its controlling shareholder 
concurrently  we acquired from the controlling shareholder the remaining interest in norsk not already owned by us 
as a result of these transactions  we now own of norsk  which as discussed previously we subsequently renamed bristow norway  and consolidate this entity effective october  the purchase consideration related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in norsk was million  representing the fair value of the interest in norsk 
we also recorded in additional paid in capital a change of interest gain of million in connection with the disposition of our indirect interest in lufttransport as 
also  on october   we made a capital contribution of million to owned norsk 
we allocated million  comprised of million paid to the controlling shareholder plus million of the net liabilities of norsk  on the date of acquisition  to aircraft  property  identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  effective april   we sold a interest in heliservicio in return for a small aircraft with a value of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of million 
we also acquired an additional interest in rlr through contribution of a note receivable of million owed by rlr to us and the contribution of the million small aircraft to rlr 
this increased our interest in this entity to from 
the contribution of the note receivable and aircraft to rlr and the receipt of the aircraft for a portion of our interest in heliservicio are included in non cash investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal year in december  we acquired severn  a multi engine instrument flight training provider located in gloucestershire  england  in exchange for our assumption of million in debt  which we repaid prior to december  financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and cash flows generated from financing activities was million for fiscal year during fiscal year  cash was primarily used for the repayment of debt totaling million primarily million for early retirement of our senior notes 
we borrowed million primarily including million on our amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement and incurred debt issuance costs of million  and our fully consolidated subsidiary  aviashelf aviation co  received million in borrowings 
during fiscal year  cash was used for the payment of preferred stock dividends of million and repayment of debt totaling million

see further discussion of outstanding debt as of march  and our debt issuances and our debt redemptions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents pension obligations as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow helicopters group limited a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation  bristow international aviation guernsey limited and bristow norway pension plans 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require the employer to agree to a funding plan with the trustee for securing that the pension plan has sufficient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions liabilities 
in addition  where there is a shortfall in assets against this measure  we are required to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as quickly as can be reasonably afforded 
in order to meet our funding requirements  we increased the contributions to the defined benefit plans to million million per year beginning in fiscal year and continuing in fiscal year we pre funded fiscal years  and employer deficit recovery contributions for the main uk pension plan in the last quarter of fiscal years  and for million million  million million  and million million  respectively 
the employers deficit contribution obligations to the main uk plan have remained unchanged at million per year following completion of the formal actuarial valuation as of april  under uk legislation  an actuarial valuation must be carried out at least once every three years with interim reports for intervening years 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments  interest payments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the table below 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of march  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents represents minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
represents expected funding for pension benefits in future periods 
these amounts are undiscounted and are based on the expectation that both the uk and norway pensions will be fully funded in approximately six and ten years  respectively 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability associated with these obligations 
the timing of the funding is dependent on actuarial valuations and resulting negotiations with the plan trustees 
for further details on our aircraft purchase obligations  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other purchase obligations primarily represent unfilled purchase orders for aircraft parts  commitments associated with upgrading facilities at our bases 
represents gross unrecognized tax benefits see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report that may result in cash payments being made to certain tax authorities 
we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods this amount will ultimately be settled and paid 
we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs limited  an unconsolidated affiliate 
the l der purchase agreement includes incremental and cumulative earn out payments based upon the achievement of growth targets over the three year periods ending december  based on l der s audited results for the years ended december  and  million in earn out payments was not earned  leaving maximum total earn out payments of million 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
in connection with the bristow norway acquisition see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we granted the former partner in this joint venture an option that if exercised would require us to acquire up to five aircraft from them at fair value upon the expiration of the lease terms for such aircraft 
one of the options was exercised in december and one option expired 
the remaining aircraft leases expire in august and june we do not expect the guarantees shown in the table above to become obligations that we will have to fund 
financial condition and sources of liquidity the following table summarizes our capital structure and sources of liquidity as of march  and in thousands march  capital structure senior notes due million term loan revolving credit facility senior notes due convertible senior notes due other debt total debt stockholders investment total capital liquidity cash undrawn borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility debt to capitalization letters of credit in the amount of  were outstanding at march  debt to capitalization is calculated as debt divided by total capital 

table of contents we actively manage our liquidity through generation of cash from operations while assessing our funding needs on an ongoing basis 
while we have generated significant cash from operations  our principal source of liquidity over the past several years has been financing cash flows 
accordingly  since the beginning of fiscal year  we raised billion of debt and equity capital by means of both public and private financings 
during this same period  we invested billion on capital expenditures to grow our business 
the significant factors that affect our overall liquidity include capital expenditure commitments  pension funding  operating leases  adequacy of bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million  cash flow from operations and proceeds from aircraft sales  as well as available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our capital commitments  including our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  while we plan to continue being disciplined concerning future capital commitments  we also intend to continue managing our capital structure and liquidity position with external financings as needed 
our strategy will involve funding our short term liquidity requirements with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funding our long term financing needs  while maintaining a prudent capital structure  among the following alternatives a export credit agency supported financings  b operating and capital leases  c bank debt and d private and public debt and or equity placements 
in november  we increased our liquidity by million with our credit facilities 
exposure to currency fluctuations see our discussion of the impact of market risk  including our exposure to currency fluctuations  on our financial position and results of operations discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  tax treaties and foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oil service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market conditions in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each 
table of contents statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal years  and we had net accruals of reserves for estimated tax exposures of million  million and million  respectively 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate  if recognized 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   we had a valuation allowance of million 
in fiscal year  we removed the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits because we currently do not expect to utilize foreign tax credits 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of establishing and then realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are indefinitely reinvested abroad of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 

table of contents useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our management periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenue and cost related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
the recognition of these obligations through the income statement is also affected by assumptions about expected returns on plan assets 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a british pound sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment and  where available  individual plan experience data 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a fair value valuation of assets and an amortization approach for assessed gains and losses that reduces year to year volatility 
this approach recognizes investment and other actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these allowances  we consider a number of factors  including our historical experience  changes in our client s financial position and restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with clients regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to major integrated oil and gas companies and government owned or government controlled oil and gas companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory allowance we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change and affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known or circumstances that change after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
the assessments are based in part on assumptions regarding the demand for helicopter services  the necessity for training of new pilots bristow academy only and current market values for similar businesses and involve the use of a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future earnings and cash flows and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expense from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies  such as australian dollars  euros  norwegian kroner  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in certain foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 
throughout fiscal years  and  our primary foreign currency exposure has been to the euro  the british pound sterling  the australian dollar and the nigerian naira 
the value of these currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar as indicated in the following table fiscal years ended march  one british pound sterling into us dollars high average low at period end one euro into us dollars high average low at period end one australian dollar into us dollars high average low at period end one nigerian naira into us dollars high average low at period end source bank of england and oanda 
com we estimate that the fluctuation of these currencies versus the prior fiscal year had the following effect on our financial condition and results of operations  net of the effect of the derivative contracts discussed below in thousands fiscal year ended march  revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses non operating expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations cumulative translation adjustment total stockholders investment 
table of contents our earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are also affected by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the reported results of our unconsolidated affiliates 
during fiscal years and  earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the results of our unconsolidated affiliates  primarily in brazil 
a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the average us dollar relative to other currencies would have affected our revenue  operating income and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year as follows euro british pound sterling nigerian naira australian dollar revenue operating expenses income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables  including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  all currencies may not uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
in addition  certain of our contractual commitments  including aircraft purchase commitments  are payable in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to cash flow risk during periods when the us dollar weakens against those currencies 
we entered into forward contracts during fiscal years  and to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
we had no open forward contracts relating to euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments as of march  we had six open forward contracts as of march   which had rates ranging from us dollars per euro to us dollars per euro 
these contracts had an underlying nominal value of between  and  for a total of  with the first contract expiring in may and the last in june as of march   the fair value of these contracts was an asset of million 
as of march   an unrecognized gain of million  net of tax  on these contracts is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the derivative asset is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
no gains or losses relating to forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal year  however  we recognized gains of million for fiscal year in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other income expense  net relating to hedges as a result of early termination of forward contracts on euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments 
in the past three fiscal years  our stockholders investment has decreased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates  we recorded foreign currency losses of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  and foreign currency gains of approximately million during fiscal year  primarily related to the british pound sterling 
see fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net and fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of transaction gains and losses 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars

we maintain allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments is minimal 
we also manage our credit risk by not entering into complex financial transactions or those with a perceived high level of credit risk
