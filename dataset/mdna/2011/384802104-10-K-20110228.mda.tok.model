item a risk factors the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 
weakness in the economy could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
economic and industry trends affect grainger s business environments 
economic downturns can cause customers  both commercial and government  to idle or close facilities  delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase grainger s products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments 
thus  a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth and results of operations 
the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented  and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger s products and services 
there are several large competitors in the industry  although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors 
grainger faces competition in all markets it serves  from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market  wholesale distributors  catalog houses  retail enterprises and internet based businesses 
competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger s sales and profitability 
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins 
some of grainger s products contain significant amounts of commodity priced materials  such as steel  copper  or oil  and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 
increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs 
grainger s ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions 
the inability to pass along costs increases could result in lower operating margins 
in addition  higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 
unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships  resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations 
grainger s competitive strengths include product selection and availability 
products are purchased from more than  key suppliers  no one of which accounted for more than of total purchases 
historically  no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply  however  economic downturns can adversely affect a supplier s ability to manufacture or deliver products 
if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products  there could be a short term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer term adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger s reputation 
in addition  grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors 
in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations  there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could  in turn  adversely affect results of operations 
the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth 
grainger  from time to time  expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes 
in  grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program 
the continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
its success will depend on grainger s ability to accurately forecast market demand  obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain 
as such  there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 
interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or breaches of information systems security could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and or decreases in revenues 
the proper functioning of grainger s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business 
although grainger s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems  including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities  information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  power losses  unauthorized access  telecommunication failures and other problems 
if critical information systems fail  are breac hed or are otherwise unavailable  grainger s ability to process orders  maintain proper levels of inventories  collect accounts receivable  pay expenses and maintain the security of company  customer and employee data could be adversely affected 
in order to compete  grainger must attract  retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 
in order to compete and have continued growth  grainger must attract  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales  marketing and support positions 
grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
grainger s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 
fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales  costs and cash flows from international operations  and could affect reported financial performance 
acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks  any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and have an adverse effect on results of operations 
acquisitions  both foreign and domestic  involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies 
there is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and an ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition 
additionally  p roblems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry  or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition 
any one or more of these factors could cause grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units 
accordingly  goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
grainger derives a growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations 
compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to grainger s international operations  including without limitation import and export requirements  the foreign corrupt practices act  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions  data privacy requirements  labor laws  and anti competition regulations  increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions  and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation 
furthermore  grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations  but there can be no assurance that employees  contractors  or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or grainger s policies 
any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect grainger s financial condition or operating results

item legal proceedings grainger has been named  along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies  as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and or silica

as of january   grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos and or silica 
grainger has denied  or intends to deny  the allegations in all of the above described lawsuits 
if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits  grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer 
in addition  grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance 
grainger has entered into agreements with its major insurance carriers relating to the scope  coverage and costs of defense of lawsuits involving claims of exposure to asbestos

united states net sales were  million for  a decrease of million  or  when compared with net sales of  million for daily sales in the united states were down 
all customer sectors were negatively impacted by economic conditions 
the overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and in the reseller customer sector 
the contractor and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the mid teens and high single digits  respectively  while the government customer sector performed the strongest with flat sales for beginning in  grainger has added approximately  new products to supplement the plumbing  fastener  material handling and security product lines as part of the business ongoing product line expansion initiative 
the catalog issued in february offered a total of  products  an increase of  products over the catalog 
the segment gross profit margin increased percentage points in over the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases  partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers 
operating expenses in this segment were down for operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount  lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation  partially offset by an increase in severance costs 
non payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts 
for the segment  operating earnings of million for decreased over million for this decrease in operating earnings for was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales  partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin 
canada net sales were million for  a decrease of million  or  when compared with million for daily sales were down and in local currency  daily sales decreased for the decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions 
partially offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector driven by special projects  and to higher sales to the government 
the gross profit margin decreased percentage points in over the decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower margin sales  particularly to large customers 
operating expenses decreased in in local currency  operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation accruals  and non payroll related expenses including lower travel and advertising costs 
in addition  included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services 
operating earnings of million for were down million  or  versus in local currency  operating earnings decreased primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross profit margin 
other businesses net sales for other businesses  which include japan  mexico  india  puerto rico  china and panama  were up for daily sales increased 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in india and japan  along with a positive contribution from china 
operating losses for other businesses were million for  a improvement compared to operating losses of million for other income and expense other income and expense was million of income in  an increase of million as compared with million of expense in the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense in thousands of dollars for the years ended december  other income and expense interest income expense net equity in net income of unconsolidated entities gain write off of investment in unconsolidated entities other non operating income other non operating expense the change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the one time non cash gain of million from the step up of the investment in monotaro after grainger became a majority owner in september in addition  included the write off of a joint venture investment in india as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains versus income taxes income taxes of million in decreased as compared with million in grainger s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
the increase in the tax rate in was primarily driven by increased us state tax rates 
financial condition grainger expects its strong working capital position  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue  allowing it to fund its operations  including growth initiatives  capital expenditures  acquisitions and repurchase of shares  as well as to pay cash dividends 
cash flow fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash from operating activities continues to serve as grainger s primary source of liquidity 
net cash flows from operations of million in decreased million from million in excluding business acquisitions  the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million  driven by the higher sales volumes 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings 
net cash used in investing activities of million in decreased million versus million in net cash expended for property  buildings  equipment and software of million decreased million from million in additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below 
in addition  net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased million versus net cash used in financing activities of million in increased million from million in grainger repaid million of long term debt in and issued million of commercial paper  resulting in a net use of cash 
cash paid for treasury share purchases of million was million higher than million in grainger repurchased million shares in compared to million shares in in  treasury share repurchases are expected to be million to million 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year net cash provided by operations of million increased million in versus million in the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in inventories due to lower purchases in response to the slowdown in the economy and lower sales volumes 
partially offsetting the increase were lower net earnings of million in versus net cash used in investing activities of million in increased million versus the increase was primarily due to million paid for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  million higher than in net cash expended for property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software was million  million lower than million in net cash used in financing activities of million in was million higher than million in proceeds from a four year bank term loan of million were included in and used to pay off million in commercial paper 
cash paid for treasury stock purchases of million was million lower than million in grainger repurchased million shares in compared to million shares in working capital internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion  supplemented by debt 
in addition  funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives  as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 
working capital was  million at december   compared with  million at december  and  million at december  at these dates  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  and working capital and the current ratio were essentially flat over this three year period 
capital expenditures in each of the past three years  a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars for the years ended december  land  buildings  structures and improvements furniture  fixtures  machinery and equipment subtotal capitalized software total in and  significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the us and canada 
additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment 
in  grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion program in the united states that realigned branches in the top major metropolitan areas 
in addition  there was continued international investment  including branch expansion in mexico  as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million in projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers  information technology  and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 
grainger expects to fund capital investments from operating cash flows 
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  grainger has various sources of financing available  including bank borrowings under lines of credit 
a four year bank term loan of million obtained in may was partially prepaid by proceeds from million of commercial paper issued in grainger s available lines of credit were million at december  and million at december  and  respectively 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was  and as of the same dates 
the reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of the reduction in long term debt 
grainger believes a ny circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
commitments and other contractual obligations at december   grainger s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows in thousands of dollars payments due by period total amounts committed less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations uncompleted additions to property  buildings and equipment commitments to purchase inventory other purchase obligations other liabilities total purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs 
while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 
other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections  and other employee benefit plans 
other employment related benefits costs of million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on long term debt and operating lease obligations  respectively 
grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of million for tax uncertainties and interest at december  this amount is excluded from the table above  as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made  which would have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivables 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
based on analysis of actual historical write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable  grainger s estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  write offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends  and grainger s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes 
for years  and  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
for fiscal years  and  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
as grainger s inventory consists of approximately  stocked products  it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a sku level and no individual sku is material 
there were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write offs historically 
grainger s methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on curren t experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date 
actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations based on significant changes in product demand  market conditions or liquidation value 
if business or economic conditions change  grainger s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate 
for fiscal years  and  actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
grainger s business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write downs that grainger may incur in future periods 
grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
grainger tests for goodwill i mpairment at the reporting unit level 
grainger s tests indicated that the fair values were substantially in excess of carrying values and thus did not fail step one of the goodwill impairment test 
grainger s determination of fair value requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of acquired businesses and market conditions 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties associated with using these assumptions  impairment charges could occur in future periods 
stock incentive plans 
grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors 
grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants 
the model requires projections of the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants 
the fair value of options granted in  and used the following assumptions for the years ended december risk free interest rate expected life years years years expected volatility expected dividend yield the risk free interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued 
the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior 
expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant 
historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions 
because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures  usin g historical forfeiture experience 
the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions 
if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used  the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 
compensation expense for other stock based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 
for additional information concerning stock incentive plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates  and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality rates 
changes in these and other assumptions caused by conditions in eq uity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the decrease in market interest rates 
grainger estimates that this decrease in the discount rate will decrease pretax earnings by approximately million  although other changes in assumptions may increase  decrease or eliminate this effect 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index and  beginning in  the total international composite index  in developing its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
a percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december  results in thousands of dollars percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate 
changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and  therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 
in calculating the liability  historical trends  claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied 
there were no material adjustments based on grainger s historical experience in  and if actual trends  including the nature  severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates  or if business or economic conditions change  grainger s estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions 
future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies such as revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets  fair value measurements and valuations  and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authori tative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
some of grainger s products contain significant amounts of commodity priced materials  such as steel  copper or oil  and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 
grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this form k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans  strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
grainger has generally identified such forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  anticipated  assumed  assumes  assumption  assumptions  believe  believes  continue  continued  continues to believe it has complied  continuing  could  estimate  estimated  estimates  expectation  expected  expects  forecast  forecasts  intended  intends  may  might  plans  predict  predictable  presumption  project  projected  projecting  projection  projections  potential  potentially  reasonably likely  scheduled  should  tended  timing and outcome are uncertain  unanticipated  will  will be realized  and would or similar expressions 
grainger cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable 
achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause grainger s results to differ materially from those which are presented 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward looking statement include  without limitation higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  loss or disruption of source of supply  increased competitive pricing pressures  failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings  investigations  inquiries  audits and changes in laws and regulations  disruption of information technology or data security systems  general industry or market conditions  general global economic conditions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  market volatility  commodity price volatility  labor shortages  litigation involving appropriate payment for wages  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and the factors identified in item a  risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger s forward looking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
grainger may use financial instruments to hedge certain exposures as part of its overall risk management strategy 
in  grainger entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the foreign exchange rate effect on its net investment in its canadian subsidiary 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and therefore  the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income 
grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the net losses on grainger s net investment hedges reported in other comprehensive income were million  net of tax effects  in see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on grainger s derivative activities 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
comparatively  in a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in net earnings for  as compared with an increase in net earnings of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio 
during and  all of its long term debt was variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately million for and million for a percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately million for and million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in long term debt levels 
grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale  but does not purchase commodities directly
