table of contents engineered film 
sales of construction films particularly in the fourth quarter and industrial films rose as business activity rebounded from recessionary levels 
full year operating margins improved  reflecting improved capacity utilization and productivity gains 
aerostar fiscal sales of million grew million and operating income of million rose million 
the sales and operating income gains were driven by increased demand for tethered aerostat systems for persistent military surveillance 
full year operating margins were down slightly year over year as margin gains due to tethered aerostat sales and resulting profitability were offset by start up costs related to the t army airborne parachute contract and higher product development and selling expenses to support the tethered aerostats business 
electronic systems fiscal sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million 
full year results were positively impacted by avionics sales growth  despite supply chain disruptions  and increased sourcing of assemblies to applied technology partially offset by weaker deliveries of circuit boards for secure communication devices 
product mix had a favorable impact on full year operating margins 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal the decrease in net sales was the result of year over year sales declines in applied technology and engineered films 
electronic systems and aerostar sales were relatively flat year over year 
expectations of lower farm income and economic uncertainty caused growers and custom spray applicators to defer purchases  which negatively affected substantially all of applied technology s product categories 
the impact of the weak economy on engineered films largest markets resulted in year over year declines of energy market sales and construction market sales 
electronic systems sales were up year over year  reflecting increased deliveries of avionics and secure communication electronics to meet rising demand from government agencies and the aerospace market  which were partially offset by a smaller customer base 
aerostar sales were flat compared with last year  as increased deliveries of mc army parachutes  aerostats and research balloons were offset by decreased deliveries of protective wear 
applied technology operating margins contracted year over year  reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and operating leverage on profitability 
however  disciplined margin management  operational efficiencies and higher productivity brought improved operating margins for engineered films  electronic systems and aerostar 
consequently  the year over year decrease in operating income was less severe than the drop in sales 
cash flow and payments to shareholders the company continues to generate strong operating cash flows and maintain a strong capital base 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the quarterly dividend was raised from cents per share to cents per share  representing the th consecutive annual increase in the dividend excluding special dividends 
during fiscal  million was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends totaling million  or cents per share  and a special dividend of million  or per share 
the special dividend was paid on september  in response to the company s strong cash position and commitment to return excess cash to shareholders 
during fiscal  million was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends 
the quarterly cash dividend increased from cents per share to cents per share beginning in the second quarter 
performance measures the company continues to generate solid returns on net sales  average assets and beginning equity  which are important gauges of raven s ability to efficiently produce profits 
raven generated a record return on sales in fiscal as the company continues to capitalize on competitive advantages in niche markets

financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million was up million versus fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million grew million and operating income of million rose million 
several factors contributed to the strong full year and fourth quarter comparative results market conditions 
us farm fundamentals were strong as commodity prices corn  soybeans and other feed grains remained above historical levels 
in addition  global market conditions were healthy as population and income growth in emerging economies continued to spur increased demand for food 
sales volume and selling prices 
fiscal sales growth was driven by higher volume and modest selling price increases 
the growth in volume reflects solid year over year demand for slingshot  application controls and guidance and steering products 
new product sales 
year to date new product sales reflected the success of slingshot an information platform which improves data collection  transmission  storage and analysis and provides rtk correction of gps signals for high accuracy steering solutions 
international sales 
net sales outside the us accounted for of segment sales in fiscal versus in fiscal international sales of million rose million year over year led by strong slingshot demand in canada 
economic growth and strong farm fundamentals in argentina and brazil drove strong overall demand in south america 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in australian sales due to weak market conditions 
gross margins 
gross margins of in fiscal rose from in fiscal due to the positive effect of higher sales and strong operating leverage on profitability 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses decreased from of sales in fiscal to in fiscal strong sales and growth opportunities drove a million increase in selling expenses and research and development expenses increased million to support product development and strategic initiatives 
fiscal net sales of million decreased million and operating income of million was down million versus fiscal lower sales and operating income were due primarily to a decrease in sales volume partially offset by modest selling price increases 
a number of factors contributed to the drop in full year comparative results economic uncertainty 
the government s calendar farm income forecast was significantly lower than actual levels 
farm production costs declined from prior year levels  however  they were outpaced by the decline in crop prices 
expectations of lower farm income and economic uncertainty led growers and custom spray applicators to defer purchases 
these factors had a negative impact on substantially all of the segment s product categories 
new product sales 
fiscal new product sales decreased from one year earlier due to the highly successful fiscal launch of innovative field computers 
international sales 
international sales of million fell million year over year 
net sales outside the us accounted for of segment sales in fiscal versus in fiscal declines in some markets were partially offset by expansion into regions not previously served 
negative operating leverage 
gross margins of in fiscal fell from in fiscal reflecting the negative

fiscal net sales of million increased million while operating income of million was up million versus fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million grew million and operating income of million rose million 
several factors contributed to the strong full year and fourth quarter comparative results improved market conditions 
business activity and confidence rose as credit markets improved and asset values stabilized 
crude oil prices rose to levels adequate to support increased drilling activity and strengthened energy market demand for pit liners 
similarly  as credit began flowing and economic uncertainty diminished  the construction and agriculture markets rose from recessionary levels 
sales volume and selling prices 
input cost increases drove a increase in selling prices 
sales volume  as measured by pounds shipped  increased over  as engineered films largest markets energy and construction rebounded from prior year depressed levels 
recovery of crude oil prices from their lows in early calendar drove additional oil and gas drilling activity and increased demand for pit liners as sales to the energy market more than doubled 
sales of industrial and construction films rose double digits 
deliveries of agriculture films rose more than 
sales of feedfresh silage covers gained traction due to healthy farm conditions and broadened appreciation of the value added benefits of this highly engineered film 
grain cover sales improved year over year due to strong yields and a short harvest cycle 
capacity utilization 
full year operating margins expanded from to as a result of improved capacity utilization 
fourth quarter profit margins fell from to as a result of less favorable leverage and increased purchases of outside materials due to capacity constraints caused by planned maintenance 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses were of sales in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in selling expenses of million lagged the increase in sales 
research and development expenses were flat year over year 
fiscal net sales of million decreased million while operating income of million was off million versus fiscal lower sales and operating income reflected falling sales volume and selling prices 
the year over year change was driven primarily by the following factors depressed markets 
dysfunctional credit markets and plunging asset values resulted in weak economic activity 
energy prices plunged as a result of the reduction in economic activity  leading to the decline in the oil and gas exploration market 
similarly  as the flow of credit slowed and economic uncertainty rose  the commercial construction markets suffered 
agricultural commodity prices also fell sharply  resulting in a softening of the agricultural market 
the impact of the recession was felt across all of the division s markets  with sales to the two largest markets energy and construction decreasing approximately and  respectively 
sales volume and selling prices 
selling prices decreased approximately and sales volume as measured by pounds 
table of contents shipped fell year over year 
these negative trends reflected market disruptions  competitive pricing pressures stemming from excess industry capacity and lower resin costs due to relatively low natural gas prices 
cost containment 
management responded quickly and decisively to the freefall in business activity experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal the necessary steps were taken to align the division with the weak business environment  by tightly managing expenses and decreasing headcount 
margin preservation 
poor economic conditions  volatile material costs and competitive pricing pressures continued to squeeze margins 
however  the impact of these factors was more than offset by opportune purchases of prime grade resin and cost containments 
consequently  gross margins increased from to 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses increased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal research and development expenses were flat year over year 
selling expenses of million decreased year over year through reductions in personnel and promotional expenses 
however  this lagged the drop in sales 
aerostar aerostar manufactures military parachutes  protective wear  custom shaped inflatable products and high altitude and tethered aerostats for government and commercial research 
financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million over fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million increased million and operating income of million increased million versus fiscal fiscal full year and fourth quarter comparative results were primarily attributable to the following tethered aerostats 
aerostar capitalized on strong demand from the us military for persistent ground surveillance systems to be deployed in afghanistan 
this segment provides the helium filled blimp  along with the fiber optics and deployment system 
the blimp is then equipped with surveillance equipment and flown on a tether at over  feet above ground level to enable persistent surveillance of a wide area 
volatility in aerostat deliveries 
sequentially  fiscal quarterly sales of aerostats varied materially million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter as design changes and funding shifts have impacted the timing of deliveries 
military parachutes 
fiscal full year and fourth quarter parachute revenue increased over as the t parachutes ramped to full production and deliveries under the t spares contract began 
gross margins 
full year gross margins improved year over year 
the negative effect of t parachute start up costs in the first half of the year and increased overhead was partially offset by a more favorable product mix as the relative contribution of tethered aerostats to total sales grew 
operating expenses 
operating expenses of million or of sales increased million from million or of sales as a result of higher selling expenses and significant investments in research and development primarily to support aerostat development 
fiscal net sales of million were flat and operating income of million grew million over fiscal fiscal results were driven by the following sales volumes 
flat year over year sales reflected increased deliveries of mc army parachutes  aerostats and research balloons  offset by decreased deliveries of protective wear due to the completion of a large contract in january margin expansion 
the improvement in gross and operating margins came from increased parachute manufacturing efficiencies 
final production runs and deliveries were made at the end of fiscal on the mc parachute contract 
fiscal was the most profitable year for the program  primarily due to the higher efficiency level attained

financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million from fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million were flat and operating income of million decreased million from fourth quarter fiscal the following factors affected fiscal full year results sales volume 
fiscal revenue was positively impacted by avionics growth and increased sourcing of assemblies to applied technology partially offset by weaker deliveries of circuit boards for secure communication devices 
profit margins 
product mix had a favorable impact on full year operating margins 
fourth quarter operating margins of were down from in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to a less favorable mix and increased overhead costs to compensate for supply chain weakness on flat sales volume 
operating expenses 
fiscal operating expenses were relatively unchanged from fiscal levels 
fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million from fiscal fiscal full year comparative results reflected the following growth from existing customers 
the rise in sales was attributable to higher deliveries of avionics and secure communication electronics to meet increased demand from government agencies and the aerospace market  partially offset by a smaller customer base 
margin expansion 
gross margins expanded as a result of positive operating leverage produced through increased sales to existing customers  favorable product mix and cost controls such as headcount reduction and facility consolidation 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were relatively flat year over year 
corporate expenses administrative expenses  income taxes and interest income and other  net for the years ended january dollars in thousands administrative expenses administrative expenses as a of sales interest income and other  net effective tax rate administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  as a result of higher compensation expense due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation 
administrative expenses declined in fiscal compared with fiscal  driven by headcount reductions and lower incentive compensation and legal expenses 
interest income and other  net consists mainly of interest income  bank fees and foreign currency transaction gain or loss 
the 
table of contents year over year variability is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the fiscal effective tax rate was favorably affected by the us federal tax deduction from income attributable to manufacturing activities 
fourth quarter fiscal tax expense was favorably impacted by renewal of the us research and development tax credit in december the rate is expected to increase slightly in fiscal outlook management believes double digit sales and profit growth for fiscal is achievable  building on strong fiscal results 
fiscal cash preservation and cost containment strategies enabled management to reinvest across the company and return million to shareholders in fiscal while maintaining substantial liquidity and a strong capital base 
in fiscal  management plans to accelerate the rate of organic investment through increased research and development  and capital investments 
management also continues to look for complementary acquisitions to augment existing products and markets  while supporting growth in quarterly dividends 
in the near term  profit margins could be pressured but these investments are intended to position the company for long term growth 
applied technology management will continue to make significant investments in product development and global expansion and is committed to building on prior year investments in sst and ranchview 
the development of an industry leading decision support system helps position applied technology as a premier total precision solutions provider gps steering devices  planting and spraying controls  data collection  transmission  storage and analysis 
applied technology s strategy of integrate  inform and innovate along with strong brand recognition  ease of use  product localization and industry leading service creates strong growth opportunities 
worldwide agriculture conditions are expected to remain healthy for this segment  with rising global demand for food  heightened environmental concerns and broadening recognition of raven s suite of productivity tools as a cost effective investment supporting management s outlook for profit growth that could approach the range 
engineered films the addition of new extrusion equipment in the second half of fiscal is expected to increase annual capacity by approximately 
this equipment will improve sales opportunities by adding both new capacity and capabilities to this segment 
additional depreciation and new product introduction costs will partially offset the positive impact of the higher pounds produced until new extrusion capacity is fully utilized 
this ramp up period has typically taken years  depending on market conditions 
in addition  profit margins are highly dependent on the ratio of selling prices to input costs 
the selling price of blown films is largely driven by competitive pricing pressure  capacity utilization and market dynamics supply and demand 
plastic resin a derivative of natural gas and oil is the primary component of extruded films 
management anticipates continuing demand for pit liners for oil exploration  geomembrane products for lining and capping landfills  water canals and reservoirs and to build on its success with highly engineered films such as feedfresh silage covers and vaporblock plus radon barriers 
double digit growth is possible  if management is able to bring the new equipment on line and exploit its new capabilities in the second half of the year 
aerostar management projects strong sales growth for the first half of the coming year 
tethered aerostat systems deployed in afghanistan have promoted the safety of us troops by successfully providing continuous wide area surveillance of insurgents 
management is optimistic about new opportunities in tethered aerostats and anticipates follow on opportunities to provide cost effective persistent surveillance for the military 
as in this past year  deliveries could vary significantly by quarter as follow on orders are dependent on the government funding process 
management also sees opportunities for growth under existing government contracts for military parachutes and new contracts for protective wear 
the engineering knowledge and manufacturing technology gained from these relationships along with expertise in sewing and sealing specialty fabrics will help solidify aerostar s competitive advantage 
additional investment in product and market development is expected to partially offset the impact of sales growth  but profit growth in the range is possible 
electronic systems management looks at electronic systems as a complementary business to its growth divisions engineered films  aerostar and especially applied technology 
this business carries technical expertise that support the efforts of its sister divisions and provides electronic manufacturing services to low volume high mix customers that require high levels of service and engineering support 
management anticipates adding an additional customer in fiscal  but believes this growth will be more than offset by lower avionics sales 
the mid to long term growth strategy is predicated on the development of proprietary products  expansion of the customer base and continued in sourcing of assemblies for raven s other divisions 
electronic systems division results for fiscal 
table of contents are expected to be roughly flat or somewhat lower than in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base 
management focuses on the current cash balance and operating cash flows in considering liquidity  as operating cash flows have historically been raven s primary source of liquidity 
management expects that current cash  combined with the generation of positive operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
raven s cash needs are seasonal  with working capital demands strongest in the first quarter 
as a result  the discussion of trends in operating cash flows focuses on the primary drivers of year over year variability in working capital 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at january   a million decrease from million on the same date in in september  the company paid a special cash dividend of million 
raven has an uncollateralized credit agreement that provides an million line of credit  with a balance of zero at january  the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of january  the credit line  which matures on july   is expected to be renewed during fiscal operating activities operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from customers  which is offset by cash payments for inventories  services  employee compensation and income taxes 
management evaluates working capital levels through the computation of average days sales outstanding and inventory turnover 
average days sales outstanding is a measure of the company s efficiency in enforcing its credit policy 
the inventory turnover ratio is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of inventory management  with further consideration given to balancing the disadvantages of excess inventory with the risk of delayed customer deliveries 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flows is the result of increased working capital to support growth  partially offset by higher company earnings 
inventory consumed million of cash in fiscal versus cash generated of million in fiscal reflecting higher raw material costs  higher forecasted demand  delayed deliveries at electronic systems and purchases of plastic resins at engineered films in anticipation of price increases 
similarly  accounts receivable consumed cash of million in fiscal versus cash generated of million in fiscal  reflecting higher receivables associated with sales growth particularly sales of engineered films and tethered aerostats 
the company continues to focus on disciplined inventory management inventory turnover of x in fiscal versus x in fiscal and improved cash collections average days sales outstanding of days in fiscal versus days in fiscal 
year over year variability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated million in cash  as compared with cash inflows of million in fiscal this reflected an increase in accounts payable commensurate with the rise in inventory and higher incentive compensation accruals associated with strong profits 
bad debt expense was not material for both fiscal and in fiscal  reductions in inventory and accounts receivable generated million in cash versus cash consumed of million in fiscal lower business levels  disciplined inventory management inventory turnover of x in fiscal versus x in fiscal and improved cash collections average days sales outstanding of days in fiscal versus days in fiscal resulted in strong operating cash flows 
additionally  year over year variability in accounts payable generated million in cash  as compared with million in fiscal  due to more favorable payment terms 
this favorable cash impact was partially offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities  which reflected lower compensation accruals and the acceleration of a million cash contribution to the employee k plan  due to a change in the plan design 
fiscal bad debt recoveries of million compared favorably to prior year expense of million  reflecting lower sales and more stable economic conditions particularly related to the company s international exposure 
investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal decrease from the prior year reflects a million increase in capital expenditures offset by a million decrease in net purchases of short term investments  proceeds of million on the disposition of an engineered films warehouse and million of cash outlays in fiscal for the sst and ranchview investments 
the increase in cash invested between fiscal and was the result of a million increase in net purchases of short term investments and million of cash outlays for the sst and ranchview investments  partially offset by a million reduction in capital expenditures 

table of contents management anticipates record capital spending in fiscal in the million range as management sees opportunities to earn attractive returns on invested capital through organic investments 
in addition  management will evaluate strategic acquisitions that result in expanded capabilities and solidify competitive advantages 
financing activities cash used in financing activities is primarily for dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 
financing activities consumed cash of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company paid quarterly dividends totaling million  or cents per share  and paid a special dividend of million  or per share 
in fiscal  the company paid quarterly dividends totaling million  or cents per share 
in fiscal  the company paid quarterly dividends totaling million  or cents per share  paid a special dividend of million  or per share and repurchased million of stock 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of january   the company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its non cancelable operating leases for facilities and equipment and unconditional purchase obligations primarily for raw materials in the amounts listed below 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations other than the items noted in the following table 
in addition to the commitments noted there  standby letters of credit totaling million have been issued  primarily to support self insured workers compensation bonding requirements 
in the event the bank chooses not to renew the company s line of credit  the letters of credit would cease and alternative methods of support for the insurance obligations would be necessary  would be more expensive and would require additional cash outlays 
management believes the chances of this are remote 
a summary of the obligations and commitments at january  and for the next five years is shown below 
less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years contractual obligations line of credit a operating leases postretirement benefits unconditional purchase obligations uncertain tax positions b a million line bears interest at as of january  and expires july the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
b the total liability for uncertain tax positions at january   was million 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments relating to non current tax benefits 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those that require the application of judgment when valuing assets and liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
these policies are discussed below  because a fluctuation in actual results versus expected results could materially affect operating results and because the policies require significant judgments and estimates to be made 
accounting related to these policies is initially based on best estimates at the time of original entry in the accounting records 
adjustments are periodically recorded when the company s actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
these adjustments could be material if experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  raven has used derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions that are denominated in currency other than its functional currency  which is the us dollar 
the use of these financial instruments had no material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents inventories the company estimates inventory valuation each quarter 
typically  when a product reaches the end of its lifecycle  inventory value declines slowly or the product has alternative uses 
management uses its manufacturing resources planning data to help determine if inventory is slow moving or has become obsolete due to an engineering change 
the company closely reviews items that have balances in excess of the prior year s requirements  or that have been dropped from production requirements 
despite these reviews  technological or strategic decisions made by management or raven s customers may result in unexpected excess material 
electronic systems typically has recourse to customers for obsolete or excess material 
when electronic systems customers authorize inventory purchases especially with long lead time items they are required to take delivery of unused material or compensate the company accordingly 
in every raven operating unit  management must manage obsolete inventory risk 
the accounting judgment ultimately made is an evaluation of the success that management will have in controlling inventory risk and mitigating the impact of obsolescence when it does occur 
warranties estimated warranty liability costs are based on historical warranty costs and average time elapsed between purchases and returns for each business segment 
warranty issues that are unusual in nature are accrued for individually 
allowance for doubtful accounts determining the level of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses based on historical writeoff experience by segment and an estimate of the collectibility of any known problem accounts 
factors that are considered beyond historical experience include the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the current business climate and the customer s current financial condition 
revenue recognition estimated returns or sales allowances are recognized upon shipment of a product 
the company sells directly to customers or distributors that incur the expense and commitment for any post sale obligations beyond stated warranty terms 
goodwill and long lived assets management assesses goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired using fair value measurement techniques 
for goodwill  raven performs impairment reviews by reporting units which are the company s reportable segments 
in the first step of goodwill impairment testing  the corporate discount rate is calculated so that the discounted cash flows are equal to raven s net enterprise value 
the corporate discount rate is then increased when evaluating any individual reporting unit due to any additional risk factors inherent within the unit versus the corporation as a whole 
a discounted cash flow analysis is then completed for the reporting unit using the adjusted discount rate 
the discounted cash flow assumptions primarily include forecasted sales and costs and the discount rate 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is then compared with its net assets 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net assets of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is possible and a more refined measurement of the impairment loss would take place 
this is the second step of the goodwill impairment testing  in which management may use market comparisons and recent transactions to assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the valuation methodologies in both steps of goodwill impairment testing use significant estimates and assumptions  which include projected future cash flows including timing and the risks inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for long lived assets  including intangibles  investments in affiliates  and property  plant and equipment  management tests for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated lives of the assets using accelerated methods  which reduces the likelihood of an impairment loss 
management periodically discusses any significant changes in the utilization of long lived assets  which may result from but are not limited to an adverse change in the asset s physical condition or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining its fair value 
uncertain tax positions accounting for tax positions requires judgments  including estimating reserves for uncertainties associated with the interpretation 
table of contents of income tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax positions with tax authorities after discussions and negotiations 
the ultimate outcome of these matters could result in material favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
this guidance modifies the first step of the goodwill impairment test to include reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for these reporting units  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  when it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance on february   is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operation  financial condition or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the exposure to market risks pertains mainly to changes in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company has no debt 
the company does not expect operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
additionally  the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  the company does utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on those transactions that are denominated in currency other than its functional currency  which is the us dollar 
the use of these financial instruments had no material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s subsidiaries that operate outside the united states use their local currency as the functional currency 
the functional currency is translated into us dollars for balance sheet accounts using the period end exchange rates  and average exchange rates for the statement of income 
adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized in the period incurred and are included in interest income and other  net in the consolidated statements of income 
foreign currency fluctuations had no material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
