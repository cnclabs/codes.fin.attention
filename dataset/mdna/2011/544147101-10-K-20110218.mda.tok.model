introductory note for periods presented in this annual report on form k prior to june   lorillard  inc was a wholly owned subsidiary of loews corporation loews  a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange the nyse 
our results of operations and financial condition were included as a separate reporting segment in loews s financial statements and filings with the sec 
beginning in and through june   loews had also issued a separate class of its common stock  referred to as the carolina group stock  to track the economic performance of loews s interest in lorillard  inc and certain liabilities  costs and expenses of loews and lorillard arising out of or related to tobacco or tobacco related businesses 
on june   we began operating as an independent  publicly traded company pursuant to our separation from loews the separation 
in connection with the separation  we entered into a separation agreement with loews to provide for the separation of our business from loews as well as providing for indemnification and allocation of taxes between the parties 

table of contents part i item business overview lorillard is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the united states 
founded in  lorillard is the oldest continuously operating tobacco company in the united states 
newport  our flagship menthol flavored premium cigarette brand  is the top selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the united states based on gross units sold in the newport brand accounted for approximately of our sales revenue for the fiscal year ended december  in addition to the newport brand  our product line has four additional brand families marketed under the kent  true  maverick  and old gold brand names 
these five brands include different product offerings which vary in price  taste  flavor  length and packaging 
in  we shipped billion cigarettes  all of which were sold in the united states and certain us possessions and territories 
we sold our major trademarks outside of the united states in we maintain our headquarters and manufacture all of our products at our greensboro  north carolina facility 
we produce cigarettes for both the premium and discount segments of the domestic cigarette market 
we do not compete in a subcategory of the discount segment that we identify as the deep discount segment 
premium brands are well known  established brands marketed at higher retail prices 
discount brands are generally less well recognized brands marketed at lower retail prices 
we define the deep discount subcategory to include brands sold at the lowest retail prices 
deep discount cigarettes are typically manufactured by smaller companies  relative to us and other major us manufacturers  many of which have no  or significantly lower  payment obligations under the state settlement agreements  consisting of the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa and the settlements of similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota 
advertising and sales promotion the predominant form of promotion in the industry and for us consists of retail price reduction programs  such as discounting or lowering the price of a pack or carton of cigarettes in the retail store 
these programs are developed  implemented and executed by our sales force through merchandising or promotional agreements with retail chain accounts and independent retailers 
we focus our retail programs in markets and stores reflecting unique potential for increased menthol sales 
our direct buying wholesale customers provide us with information as to the quantities of cigarettes shipped to their retail accounts on a weekly basis 
this data covers approximately of wholesale units shipped by us and our major competitors  and enables us to analyze  plan and execute retail promotion programs in markets and stores that optimize the most efficient and effective return on our promotional investments 
we employ other promotion methods to communicate with our adult consumers as well as with adult smokers of our competitors products 
these promotional programs include the use of direct marketing communications  retail coupons  relationship marketing and promotional materials intended to be displayed at retail 
relationship marketing entails the use of various communication techniques to directly reach adult consumers in order to establish a relationship with them for the purpose of advertising and promoting a product or products 
we use our proprietary database of smokers of our brands and smokers of our competitors brands to reach adult consumers with targeted communications about a given brand through age restricted direct mail and internet programs 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  sales promotion costs in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
advertising plays a relatively lesser role in our overall marketing strategy 
we advertise newport in a limited number of magazines that meet certain requirements regarding the age and composition of their readership 
newport is our only brand that receives magazine advertising support 

table of contents advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities including  among other things prohibiting the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  banning the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limiting each tobacco manufacturer to one brand name event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  banning all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  banning tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibiting the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities  prohibiting payments for tobacco product placement in various media  and banning gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
on june  the federal family smoking prevention and tobacco control act the fsptca was signed into law granting authority over the regulation of tobacco products to the fda 
pursuant to the fsptca  the fda reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products 
the fsptca also contains other restrictions  some of which may be more stringent than those found in the original fda rule  affecting the advertising  marketing and sale of cigarette products 
see the section entitled legislation and regulation below for additional information concerning the marketing and sales provisions of the fsptca 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising  marketing and sales promotions  and others may do so in the future 
we cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on our marketing and sales efforts 
we fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in discussing the issue of smoking with their children 
we are also a founding member of the coalition for responsible tobacco retailing which through its we card program trains retailers in how to prevent the purchase of cigarettes by underage persons 
in addition  we have adopted guidelines established by the national association of attorneys general to restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under the age of customers and distribution our field sales personnel are based throughout the united states  and we maintain field sales offices in major cities throughout the united states 
our sales department is divided into regions based on geography and sales territories 
we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  we ship cigarettes to public distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
we retain a portion of our manufactured cigarettes at our greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   we had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts 
we do not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by us to the mclane company  inc comprised  and  respectively  of our revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or sales 
we do not have any written sales agreements with our customers  including the mclane company  inc we do not have any backlog orders 

table of contents most of our customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
customer orders are shipped from public distribution warehouses via third party carriers 
we do not ship products directly to retail stores 
in  approximately of our customers purchased cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to us 
raw materials and manufacturing in our production of cigarettes  we use domestic and foreign grown burley and flue cured leaf tobaccos  as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf of the type and quality we require at competitive prices from a combination of global sources  and that we are not dependent on any one geographic region or country for our requirements 
an affiliate of reynolds american inc rai manufactures all of our reconstituted tobacco pursuant to our specifications  as set forth in the agreement between us and rai 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
we purchase our tobacco leaf through tobacco dealers  which contract with leaf growers 
such purchases are made at prevailing market prices in the country of origin 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops  changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other foreign currencies and other economic factors  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
we direct these dealers in the purchase of tobacco according to our specifications for quality  grade  yield  particle size  moisture content  and other characteristics 
the dealers purchase and process the whole leaf and then dry and package it for shipment to and storage at our danville  virginia facility 
we have not experienced any difficulty in purchasing our requirement of leaf tobacco 
we purchase more than of our domestic leaf tobacco from one dealer  alliance one international  inc alliance one 
if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that we can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources 
however  we believe that such high quality leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one 
we store our tobacco in storage warehouses on our acre danville  virginia facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses 
certain types of tobacco used in our blends must be allowed to mature over time to allow natural chemical changes that enhance certain characteristics affecting taste 
because of these aging requirements  we maintain large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
we believe our current tobacco inventories are sufficient and adequately balanced for our present and expected production requirements 
if necessary  we can typically purchase aged tobacco in the open market to supplement existing inventories 
we produce cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  we actively monitor all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
research and development we have an experienced research and development team that continuously evaluates new products and line extensions and assesses new technologies and scientific advancements to be able to respond to marketplace demands and developing regulatory requirements 
our research and development efforts focus primarily on developing quality products that appeal to adult consumers  studying and developing consumer acceptable products with the potential for reduced exposure to smoke constituents or reduced health risk  
table of contents identifying and investigating  through the use of internal and external resources  suspect constituents of cigarette products or their components to determine the feasibility of reduction or elimination  maintaining state of the art knowledge about public health and scientific issues related to cigarette products  developing new  or modifying existing  products and processes to promote quality control and to comply with current and anticipated laws and regulations  and collaborating and cooperating with outside public and private scientific institutions and encouraging independent research relating to cigarette products 
tobacco related research activities include analysis of cigarette components  including cigarette paper  filters  tobacco and ingredients  including menthol  analysis of mainstream and sidestream smoke  and modification of cigarette design 
we employ advanced scientific equipment in our research efforts  including gas chromatographs  mass spectrographs and liquid chromatographs 
we use this equipment to structurally identify and measure the amount of chemical compounds found in cigarette smoke and various tobaccos 
these measurements allow us to better understand the relationship between the tobacco  cigarette construction  and the smoke yielded from cigarettes 
in addition  advanced biological techniques are developed and used to test the biological impact of tobacco smoke on cells and advance our understanding of potential biomarkers for disease risk 
information technology we are committed to the use of information technology throughout the organization to provide operating effectiveness  cost reduction and competitive advantages 
we believe our system platform provides the appropriate level of information in a timely fashion to effectively manage the business 
we utilize proven technologies while also continuously exploring new technologies consistent with our information technology architecture strategy 
our information technology environment is anchored by an sap enterprise resource planning erp system designed to meet the processing and analysis needs of our core business operations and financial control requirements 
the process control and production methods in our manufacturing operation utilize scanning  radio frequency identification  wireless technologies and software products to monitor and control the manufacturing process 
our primary data center is located at our corporate headquarters and is staffed by an in house team of experienced information technology professionals 
a satellite data center  located at our manufacturing facility  supports our manufacturing environment 
in addition  we have a comprehensive redundancy and disaster recovery plan in place 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
as of that date  approximately  of those employees were represented by labor unions covered by three collective bargaining agreements 
local union t greensboro of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc represents workers at our greensboro manufacturing plant 
the agreement covering this union expires in september workers at our danville  virginia tobacco storage facility are also represented by local union t danville of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc and local union of the national conference of firemen and oilers seiu afl cio clc 
the current agreements with local union t danville and local union will expire in april we have historically had an amicable relationship with the unions representing our employees 
we provide a retirement plan  a profit sharing plan and other benefits for our hourly paid employees who are represented by unions 
in addition  we provide to our salaried employees a retirement plan  group life  disability and health insurance program and a savings plan 
we also maintain an incentive compensation plan for certain salaried employees 

table of contents intellectual property we believe that our trademarks  including brand names  are important to our business 
we own the patents  trade secrets  know how and trademarks  including our brand names and the distinctive packaging and displays  used by us in our business 
all of our material trademarks are registered with the us patent and trademark office 
rights in these trademarks in the united states will continue indefinitely as long as we continue to use the trademarks 
we consider the blends of tobacco and the flavor formulas used to make our brands to be trade secrets 
these trade secrets are generally not the subject of patents  though various of our manufacturing processes are patented 
we sold the international rights to substantially all of our major brands  including newport  in competition the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s taste  quality  price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  and retail display 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris usa inc philip morris  a subsidiary of altria group  inc and rj reynolds tobacco company rjr tobacco  a subsidiary of rai 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris and rjr tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales 
please read the sections entitled item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and selected industry and market share data beginning on pages and  respectively  for additional information 
legislation and regulation our business operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the research  development and manufacture of cigarettes  the development of new tobacco products  the publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertising  the sale of tobacco products  restrictions on smoking in public places  and fire safety standards 
from time to time  new legislation and regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco products 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals  reports and recommendations 
if they are enacted or implemented  certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
federal regulation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 

table of contents this law also requires that each company that manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients 
in addition  bills have been introduced in congress  including those that would prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  direct the placement of advertising of tobacco products  provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores  by mail or over the internet  impose additional  or increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes and require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing 
in june  the us congress passed  and the president signed into law  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act that grants the food and drug administration fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
the legislation established a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to  among other things  evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the fda regarding menthol by march   grants the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes  requires larger and more severe health warnings  including graphic images  on packs  cartons  and advertising  bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products  such as low tar and light  requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers  requires pre market approval by the fda of all new products  including substantially equivalent products  requires pre market approval by the fda for all claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  allows the fda to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market  allows the fda to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allows the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes  allows the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation 

table of contents the legislation permits the fda to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes  including a ban  if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health 
any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
it is possible that such additional regulation  including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof  could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states including sales of our brands  increased costs to us  and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
environmental tobacco smoke various publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke ets presents health risks 
in addition  public health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects of ets  and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems associated with ets exposure 
various states  cities and municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years  and these restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated with ets exposure 
the governmental entities that have published these reports have included the surgeon general of the united states  first in and again in the report  for instance  concluded that there is no risk free level of exposure to ets 
in  the department of health and human services listed ets as a known human carcinogen 
in  the us environmental protection agency concluded that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children 
agencies of state governments also have issued publications regarding ets  including reports by california entities that were published in  and in the study  the california air resources board determined that ets is a toxic air contaminant 
based on these or other findings  public health concerns regarding ets have lead and could continue to lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking  including bans  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future 
state and local regulation many state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa s report regarding ets in two states  massachusetts and texas  have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands 
neither law allows for the public release of trade secret information 
a new york law which became effective in june requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard for ignition propensity 
we developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and were compliant by the effective date 
since the passage of the new york law  an additional states and the district of columbia have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards 
the effective dates of these laws range from may to january as of november   all of our cigarettes were manufactured using this technology 
other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments 
we cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on our business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future 

table of contents excise taxes and assessments cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes in the united states and  in general  such taxes have been increasing 
effective april   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased to per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes from per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes

increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during and ranged from per pack to per pack 
for the twelve months ended december   the combined state and municipal taxes ranged from to per pack of cigarettes 
a federal law enacted in october repealed the federal supply management program for tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers 
cigarette manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying of a billion payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten year period 
the law provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic consumption

item a 
risk factors fda regulation of menthol in cigarettes and concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect our business 
some plaintiffs in our litigation and constituencies  including the fda and other public health agencies  have claimed or expressed concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non mentholated cigarettes  including concerns that mentholated cigarettes may make it easier to start smoking and harder to quit and may seek restrictions or a ban on the production and sale of mentholated cigarettes 
any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
following the passage of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act in june  the fda established the tobacco products scientific advisory committee the tpsac to evaluate  among other things  the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health  including such use among children  african americans  hispanics  and other racial and ethnic minorities 
in addition  the fsptca permits the fda to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes  including a ban  if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health 
the tpsac held meetings on march   july   september   october   november  and january  to consider the issues surrounding the use of menthol in cigarettes 
tpsac has scheduled further meetings on the use of menthol in cigarettes  and tpsac s report and nonbinding recommendations on menthol are currently due to the fda by march  since we are the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the united states  we could face increased exposure to tobacco related litigation as a result of such allegations 
even if such claims are unsubstantiated  increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could materially adversely affect our sales  including sales of newport 
a ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes by the fda would materially adversely affect our business 
the regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration may materially adversely affect our business 
in june  the us congress passed  and the president signed into law  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act that grants the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
the legislation established a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to  among other things  evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the fda regarding menthol by march   grants the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes  requires larger and more severe health warnings  including graphic images  on packs  cartons and advertising  bans the use of descriptors on tobacco products  such as low tar and light  requires the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers  requires pre market approval by the fda of all new products  including substantially equivalent products  
table of contents requires pre market approval by the fda for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  allows the fda to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market  allows the fda to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allows the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes  allows the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminates the existing federal preemption of such regulation 
we believe that such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for example  under the fsptca  we must file a report with the fda substantiating that any cigarettes introduced or modified after february  are substantially equivalent to cigarettes on the market before that date to enable the agency to determine whether the new or modified products are substantially equivalent to specific predicate products already being sold 
for any products introduced or modified between february  and march   initial reports must be filed with the fda before march  the fda has announced that a product introduced or modified before march  may remain on the market pending the fda s review  provided a substantially equivalent report has been filed with the fda on or before march  we believe  based on the limited guidance issued by the fda to date  that we must file reports for all of our cigarettes by march  since modifications have been made to our products since while all of our cigarettes may remain on the market pending the fda s review  they are subject to removal should the fda determine any are not substantially equivalent 
the legislation also permits the fda to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes  including a ban  if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health 
any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
it is possible that such additional regulation  including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof  could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states including sales of our brands  increased costs to us and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as of february   lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  tobacco related lawsuits  including approximately cases in which lorillard  inc is a co defendant 
these cases  which are extremely costly to defend  could result in substantial judgments against lorillard tobacco and or lorillard  inc numerous legal actions  proceedings and claims arising out of the sale  distribution  manufacture  development  advertising  marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future 
in addition  several cases have been filed against lorillard tobacco and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the msa among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions  and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the msa 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that the outcome of these cases  individually or in the aggregate  could result in bankruptcy 
it is also possible that lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case 
even if lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc are successful in defending some or all of these actions  these types of cases are very expensive to defend 
a material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
further  adverse decisions in litigations against other tobacco companies could have an adverse impact on the industry  including us 

table of contents a jury has returned verdicts that award damages from lorillard tobacco in a conventional product liability case 
in december  a massachusetts jury awarded million in compensatory damages to the estate of a deceased smoker  million in damages to the deceased smoker s son  and million in punitive damages from lorillard tobacco in a conventional product liability case  evans v 
lorillard tobacco company superior court  suffolk county  massachusetts 
as of february   the case remained pending before the trial court because the judge has not issued a verdict as to a single claim that was not submitted for the jury s consideration 
it is possible the court will award additional damages to the plaintiffs in its verdict that addresses this final claim 
as of february   the court had not ruled on the motions filed by lorillard tobacco following the verdicts  which includes motions for new trial  for judgment notwithstanding the verdict  and for reduction or elimination of the jury s damages awards 
the court is not expected to issue a final judgment until it disposes of the final claim or it rules on lorillard tobacco s post trial motions 
lorillard tobacco may file additional post trial motions after a final judgment is entered 
should the final judgment award damages to the plaintiff  massachusetts statutes provide that the court may award prejudgment and post judgment interest 
the opportunity for lorillard tobacco to initiate an appeal from the verdicts in evans will not begin until the final judgment is entered 
plaintiff has asked the court to enter a preliminary injunction that directs lorillard tobacco to set aside million in cash or cash equivalents to secure the amounts awarded by the jury and the interest obligations plaintiff expects the court to order in a final judgment 
as of february   the court had not ruled on plaintiff s motion for preliminary injunction 
it is possible that the verdict in this case could lead to additional litigation 
a judgment has been rendered against lorillard tobacco in the scott litigation 
in july  the district court of orleans parish  louisiana  entered an amended final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in scott v 
the american tobacco company  et al 
district court  orleans parish  louisiana  filed may   a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the state of louisiana 
in april  the louisiana court of appeal  fourth circuit  issued a decision that modified the trial court s amended final judgment 
the court of appeal s decision reduced the judgment amount to approximately million to fund a ten year court supervised smoking cessation program 
the april decision ordered that an award of post judgment interest will accrue from july interest awarded by the amended final judgment will continue to accrue from july until the judgment either is paid or is reversed on appeal 
as of february   judicial interest totaled approximately million 
lorillard tobacco s share of any judgment  including an award of post judgment interest  has not been determined 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax provision of approximately million for this matter 
lorillard  inc  which was a party to the case in the past  is no longer a defendant 
the us supreme court has granted defendants application to stay execution of the amended final judgment until defendants petition for writ of certiorari to the us supreme court is resolved 
as of february   the us supreme court had not determined whether it will grant review of defendants certiorari petition 
it is not possible to predict the final outcome of this matter 
the florida supreme court s ruling in engle has resulted in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
the case of engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
circuit court  dade county  florida  filed may  was certified as a class action on behalf of florida residents  and survivors of florida residents  who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking 
the case was tried between and in a multi phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class 
in  the florida supreme court issued a ruling that  among other things  determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action 
in february  the trial court entered an order on remand from the florida supreme court that formally decertified the class 
the ruling by the florida supreme court in engle also permitted members of the engle class to file individual claims  including claims for punitive damages 
the florida supreme court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on a number of the jury s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of 
table of contents the engle trial 
these findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases  that cigarettes are addictive or dependence producing  and that the defendants  including lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  were negligent  breached express and implied warranties  placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking 
lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  cases pending in various state and federal courts in florida that were filed by members of the engle class the engle progeny cases  including cases in which lorillard  inc is a co defendant 
as of february   lorillard tobacco was a defendant in one engle progeny case in which trial was underway 
lorillard  inc is not a defendant in this trial 
neither lorillard tobacco nor lorillard  inc were defendants in three additional engle progeny cases in which trial was underway as of february  in addition  lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc are defendants in engle progeny cases that have been placed on courts trial calendars or in which specific trial dates have been set 
trial schedules are subject to change and it is not possible to predict how many of the engle progeny cases pending against lorillard tobacco or lorillard  inc will be tried during it also is not possible to predict whether some courts will implement procedures that consolidate multiple engle progeny cases for trial 
as of february   verdicts have been returned in engle progeny cases since the florida supreme court issued its ruling 
lorillard tobacco was a defendant in one of the trials 
as of february   lorillard  inc had not been a defendant in any of the trials in which verdicts were returned 
juries awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages in of these trials 
the punitive damages awards have totaled million and have ranged from  to million 
in six of the trials  juries awarded only compensatory damages 
in the twelve other trials  juries found in favor of the defendants 
in the single trial in which lorillard tobacco had been a defendant as of february   the jury returned a verdict for the defendants 
in some of the trials decided in the defendants favor  plaintiffs have filed motions challenging the verdicts 
it is not possible to predict the final outcome of this litigation 
the judgment entered in the federal government s reimbursement case  while not final in all respects  could restrict or limit our defenses in other litigation 
in august  a final judgment and remedial order was entered in united states of america v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
us district court  district of columbia  filed september  
the court based its final judgment and remedial order on the government s only remaining claims  which were based on the defendants alleged violations of the racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
lorillard  inc is not a party to this matter  but lorillard tobacco is one of the defendants in the case 
although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff  the final judgment and remedial order imposed a number of requirements on the defendants 
such requirements include  but are not limited to  corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking 
in  a three judge panel of the court of appeals upheld substantially all of the district court s final judgment and remedial order 
in june  the us supreme court denied the parties petitions seeking review of the case 
the case has been returned to the us district court  district of columbia for implementation of the court of appeals directions in its ruling and for entry of an amended final judgment 
as of february   the trial court had not entered the amended final judgment 
the final judgment and remedial order made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants 
it is possible that the final opinion  final judgment and remedial order entered by the court could form the basis of allegations by the plaintiffs in other matters  or of additional judicial findings by other courts against cigarette manufacturers 
it is possible that other courts could apply the findings in the united states of america case to restrict or otherwise limit our defenses in other litigation 

table of contents a ruling by the united states supreme court could limit the ability of cigarette manufacturers to contend that certain claims asserted against them in product liability litigation are barred 
the supreme court s decision also could encourage litigation involving cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar 
in december  the united states supreme court issued a decision that neither the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act nor the federal trade commission s regulation of cigarettes tar and nicotine disclosures preempts or bars some of plaintiffs claims 
the decision also more broadly addresses the scope of preemption based on the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act  and could significantly limit cigarette manufacturers arguments that certain of plaintiffs other claims in smoking and health litigation  including claims based on the alleged concealment of information with respect to the hazards of smoking  are preempted 
in addition  the supreme court s ruling could encourage litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us  regarding the sale of cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar  and it may limit cigarette manufacturers ability to defend such claims 
the supreme court issued this ruling in a purported lights class action  good v 
altria group  inc we were not a defendant in good 
the us surgeon general has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes  and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
in a report entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke a report of the surgeon general   the us surgeon general summarized conclusions from previous surgeon general s reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second hand smoke by non smokers 
according to this report  scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions second hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke 
children exposed to second hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome  acute respiratory infections and ear problems 
exposure of adults to second hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer 
the scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk free level of exposure to second hand smoke 
many millions of americans  both children and adults  are exposed to second hand smoke in their homes and workplaces 
eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non smokers from exposure to second hand smoke 
separating smokers from non smokers  cleaning the air  and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non smokers to second hand smoke 
this report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
the report could be used to support existing litigation against us or other cigarette manufacturers 
it also is possible that the surgeon general s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
it is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of our brands 
these developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future periods 
in  lorillard tobacco  philip morris incorporated  brown williamson tobacco corporation and rj reynolds tobacco company the original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota the initial state settlements and  together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 

table of contents under the state settlement agreements  we paid billion in and are obligated to pay between billion and billion in  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
annual payments under the state settlement agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based  among other things  on our domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding the year in which payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 
we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of certain material pending litigation 
we record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements and the provision relating to the scott case  as described in the risk factor a judgment has been rendered against lorillard tobacco in the scott litigation above  we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and  therefore  no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that our results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation 
we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of low priced products or innovative products  higher cigarette taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris and rjr tobacco 
we also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes 
if our major competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers  we could respond by increasing price discounts  which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we are subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm our competitive position 
television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  we generally cannot use billboard advertising  cartoon characters  sponsorship of concerts  non tobacco merchandise bearing lorillard s brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques 
in addition  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products 
accordingly  we have determined not to advertise our cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of on june  the federal family smoking prevention and tobacco control act was signed into law granting authority over the regulation of tobacco products to the fda 
pursuant to the fsptca  the fda reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products 
the fsptca contains other restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sale of cigarette products more stringent than those found in the original fda rule 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising  marketing and sales promotions  and others may do so in the future 
additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future 
these limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason 
moreover  these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers  including us  to launch new premium brands 

table of contents changes in laws  regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition to the regulation of our business by the fda  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by new or future legal requirements imposed by legislative or regulatory initiatives  including but not limited to those relating to health care reform  climate change and environmental matters 
for example  the health care reform legislation  which was signed into law in march  resulted in the repeal of million of future tax deductions for medicare part d subsidies for our retiree drug benefits and could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits  employer sponsored medical plans and related matters in future periods 
however  the extent of that impact  if any  cannot be determined until regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations of the health care law are available 
new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase the prices of goods and services because of increased costs or reduced availability 
we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations and or whether any changes in such laws or regulations will have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes 
on april   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased per pack to per pack to finance health insurance for children 
for the twelve months ended december   combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially in recent years 
in addition  increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in six states during and ranged from per pack to per pack 
it is our expectation that several states will propose further increases in and in subsequent years 
we believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes 
in addition  we believe that the increase in the federal excise tax  as well as possible future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  compounded by poor economic conditions  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
we are dependent on the domestic cigarette business  which we expect to continue to contract 
although we conduct business in puerto rico  guam and the us virgin islands  our cigarette business in the states of the united states the domestic cigarette market is currently our only significant business 
the domestic cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue to contract 
we do not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects  as we sold the international rights to substantially all of our brands  including newport  in as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  industry wide domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately during the period through industry wide domestic cigarette shipments decreased by an estimated for compared to  for compared to  for to and during  compared to we derive most of our revenue from one brand 
our largest selling brand  newport  accounted for approximately of our sales revenue for our principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of the newport brand 
we cannot ensure that we will continue to successfully implement our strategic plan with respect to newport or that implementation of our strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the newport brand 

table of contents the use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on our business 
since  the cigarette market has been increasingly price competitive due to the impact of  among other things  higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands 
in response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures  we have engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives 
the cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
we rely on a limited number of key executives and may continue to experience difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business 
as a tobacco company  we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in some areas of our business 
this difficulty is primarily attributable to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry 
the loss of services of any key personnel or our inability to attract and hire personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products  enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products or manage our business effectively 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to develop  produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences 
consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require us to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products 
for example  states and the district of columbia have passed legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products 
we believe that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette  an alternative cigarette or an alternative tobacco product that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects 
certain of the other major cigarette makers have already developed and marketed alternative cigarette products 
we may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers 
in addition  the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial 
increased restrictions on smoking in public places could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
in recent years  states and many local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict  or discourage smoking  smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  and smoking on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future 
although we have no empirical evidence of the effect of such restrictions  we believe that restrictions on smoking in public and other places may lead to a decrease in the number of people who smoke or a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers 
increased restrictions on smoking in public and other places may have caused a decrease  and may continue to cause a decrease in the volume of cigarettes that would otherwise be sold by us absent such restrictions  which may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
the availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states  including counterfeits of our newport brand  could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands 
additionally  smokers who mistake counterfeit cigarettes for our 
table of contents cigarettes may attribute quality and taste deficiencies in the counterfeit product to our brands and discontinue purchasing our brands 
although we do not believe that sales of counterfeit newport cigarettes have had a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits to date  the availability of counterfeit newport cigarettes together with substantial increases in excise taxes and other potential price increases could result in increased demand for counterfeit product that could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 
we rely on a single manufacturing facility for the production of our cigarettes 
we produce all of our cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing facility 
if our manufacturing plant is damaged  destroyed or incapacitated or we are otherwise unable to operate our manufacturing facility  we may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain of our domestic leaf tobacco and reconstituted tobacco 
we purchase approximately of our domestic leaf tobacco through one supplier  alliance one international  inc if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one  which could have a material adverse effect on our future profits 
in addition  we purchase all of our reconstituted tobacco from one supplier  which is an affiliate of rai  one of our major competitors 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
if rai becomes unwilling or unable to supply us and we are unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis  our operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of our trademarks  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logo and the unique features of our tobacco products 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are ineffective  thereby permitting a third party to misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from growing or maintaining market share 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  and of delaware law  may prevent or delay an acquisition of us  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms  elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent  rules regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors 

table of contents delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board with time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to prevent such takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and those of our shareholders 
the separation agreement between us and loews contains provisions that may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
the tax free nature of the separation may be affected by certain transactions undertaken by us 
in particular  under section e of the internal revenue code  the separation would become taxable to loews if it was determined that or more of the shares of our common stock were acquired  directly or indirectly  as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the separation 
if  as a result of acquisitions of our common stock subsequent to the separation  the separation becomes taxable pursuant to section e  loews would recognize a substantial gain for tax purposes as the separation would be treated as a sale of lorillard for federal income tax purposes 
the separation agreement requires us and any successor entity to indemnify loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction except if the failure to qualify is solely due to loews s fault 
this indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above  or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel 
these restrictions and potential indemnification obligations may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
we are required to indemnify loews against losses and other expenses incurred at any time including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation with respect to our assets  properties and businesses 
in the separation agreement  we have agreed to indemnify loews and its officers  directors  employees and agents against costs and expenses including  but not limited to  litigation matters and other claims based on  arising out of or resulting from  among other things  the ownership or the operation of us and our assets and properties  and the operation or conduct of us and our businesses at any time prior to or following the separation including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation 
if loews incurs legal or other fees or costs and expenses resulting from the operation of our businesses or otherwise with respect to us  we are required to reimburse loews for such losses and any legal or other fees related thereto  which could be substantial 
these indemnification obligations may discourage third parties from trying to acquire us because our indemnification obligations are binding on our successors and we are prohibited by the separation agreement from merging  consolidating or transferring all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity  transferee or successor agrees to be bound by these indemnification obligations 
in addition  we could face substantial charges for indemnification payments to loews  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe the separation has altered or will alter our legal exposure with respect to tobacco related claims

in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the forward looking statements  item a 
risk factors  business environment and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  applied on a consistent basis 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include accruals for tobacco settlement costs  legal expenses and litigation costs  sales incentive programs  income taxes and share based compensation  the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the valuation of pension assets 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  evaluation of current trends  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time 
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment  actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of sales incentives  is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured 
federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales 
sales incentives include retail price discounts  coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates 
tobacco settlement costs in  we and the other original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota which are referred to as the initial state settlements  and together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding that in which the payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 
we record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 
please read state settlement agreements beginning on page for additional information 

table of contents tobacco and other litigation we and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation 
plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages  although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars 
plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages  statutory damages  return of profits  equitable and injunctive relief  and medical monitoring  among other damages 
we believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us 
we also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us 
while we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably 
we may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so 
we record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements and the provision relating to the scott case  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page  our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and  therefore  no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that our results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation 
defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling  general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred 
defense costs may increase in future periods  in part  as a result of the engle progeny cases as described in note  legal proceedings  to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period 
the principal factors are as follows the number and types of cases filed and appealed  the number of cases tried and appealed  the development of the law  the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel  and litigation strategy and tactics 
please read note legal proceedings  to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilized current market information and liability information  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the discount rate was determined by projecting the plan s expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation 

table of contents the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  asset allocations and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our major assumptions are set forth in note to our consolidated audited financial statements beginning on page for  hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standard codification topic income taxes 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
the uncertain tax provisions of asc prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  asc provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
the inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although  due to the duration of the aging processes  a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year 
recent accounting pronouncements please read recently adopted accounting pronouncements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page business environment participants in the us tobacco industry  including us  face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so  including a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes  addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights  as well as other alleged damages 
substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity  and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements  including the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa that we entered into in along with philip 
table of contents morris incorporated  brown williamson tobacco corporation and rj reynolds tobacco company the other original participating manufacturers to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota the initial state settlements  and together with the msa  the state settlement agreements 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the domestic cigarette market  in which we currently conduct our only significant business  continues to contract 
as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising  promotions and smoking in public and private facilities  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately from through increases in cigarette prices since have led to an increase in the volume of discount and  specifically  deep discount cigarettes 
cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal  state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases 
price increases have led  and continue to lead  to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands 
deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in of less than to an estimated for the twelve months ended december   and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market 
we do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking  but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so 
the tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation 
in june  the us congress passed  and the president signed into law  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act granting the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
pursuant to the terms of the fsptca  the fda could promulgate regulations that could  among other things  result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes 
the law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed  require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging  permit restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured 
in august  we  along with rjr tobacco  other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer  filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the western district of kentucky against the fda challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the fsptca 
these restrictions on speech include  among others  bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising  limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products  a prohibition on making certain statements about the fda s regulation of tobacco products  restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising  a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products  a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise  and a ban on the distribution of product samples 
the suit also challenges the law s requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising 
the complaint seeks a judgment i declaring that such provisions of the law violate the first and or fifth amendments of the us constitution and ii enjoining the fda from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law 
on january   the district court issued an order a striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the fda s regulation of tobacco products and b upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions 
both sides have appealed the district court s ruling to the sixth circuit court of appeals  and the appeal has been fully briefed 
while we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our claims we cannot predict the outcome of any such appeal 
nor can we make any assurances that any such appeal will be successful 

table of contents the federal government and many state and local governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict or discourage smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by federal  state and local governments in the future 
substantial federal  state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes 
as of april   the federal excise tax was per pack and for the twelve months ended december  combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
for the twelve months ended december   excise tax increases ranging from to per pack were implemented in six states and the district of columbia 
congress enacted and the president signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by per pack to per pack  effective april   to finance health insurance for children 
it is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
in addition  we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers 
the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s taste  quality  price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  and retail display 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris and rjr tobacco 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes  including deep discount cigarette manufacturers 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris and rjr tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales

in april  lorillard tobacco issued billion of unsecured senior notes in two tranches pursuant to an indenture  dated june   and the second supplemental indenture  dated april  the second supplemental indenture 
the first tranche was million aggregate principal amount of notes due may  the notes  and the second tranche was million aggregate principal amount of notes due may  the notes 
lorillard tobacco is the principal  wholly owned operating subsidiary of the company and the notes and notes the notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the company 
the net proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things  the repurchase  redemption or retirement of securities including the company s common stock  acquisitions  additions to working capital and capital expenditures 
upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event  lorillard tobacco will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
a change of control triggering event occurs when there is both a change of control as defined in the second supplemental indenture and the notes cease to be rated investment grade by both moody s and s p within days of the occurrence of a change of control or public announcement of the 
table of contents intention to effect a change of control 
the notes are not entitled to any sinking fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity 
the notes contain covenants that restrict liens and sale and leaseback transactions  subject to a limited exception 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares at a cost of per share and totaling million under the billion repurchase program announced on august   the million repurchase program announced february  and the million repurchase program announced july  as of february   the maximum dollar value of shares that could yet be purchased under the billion program was million 
purchases by the company under these programs were made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block purchase techniques or otherwise  as determined by the company s management 
the purchases were funded from existing cash balances  including proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
these programs do not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock 
the timing  frequency and amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for investment in the company s business  current stock price  market conditions and other factors 
liquidity we believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the state settlement agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  if necessary  and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements 
the rate of return on our pension assets in was a positive 
our pension expense was approximately million in and we anticipate pension expense of approximately million in we contributed million to our pension plans in and anticipate a contribution of million in we believe that it is appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns 
accordingly  we raised billion and million of debt financing in and  respectively  and we expect that we will seek to raise additional debt financing in the future  although the structure  timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment  our cash requirements  and other business  financial and tax considerations 
the proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases  acquisitions  dividends or for other general corporate purposes 
we presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transactions and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or  if pursued  that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms 
in march  lorillard tobacco  the principal  wholly owned operating subsidiary of the company  entered into a million revolving credit facility revolver that expires march  and is guaranteed by the company 
proceeds from the revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes 
the interest rates on borrowings under the revolver will be based on prevailing interest rates and  in part  upon the credit rating applicable to the company s senior unsecured long term debt 
the revolver requires that the company maintain a ratio of debt to net income plus income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  any extraordinary losses  any non cash expenses or losses and any losses on sales of assets outside of the ordinary course of business ebitda of not more than to and a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of not less than to in addition  the revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on liens and sale and leaseback transactions subject to a limited exception 
the revolver contains customary events of default  including upon a change in control that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding  if any  under the revolver 

table of contents there were no borrowings under the revolver during state settlement agreements the state settlement agreements require us and the other original participating manufacturers philip morris incorporated  brown williamson tobacco corporation and rj reynolds tobacco company to make aggregate annual payments of billion in perpetuity  subject to adjustment for several factors described below 
in addition  the original participating manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees  subject to an aggregate annual cap of million 
these payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the original participating manufacturers 
our obligations under the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years 
both the aggregate payment obligations of the original participating manufacturers  and our payment obligations  individually  under the state settlement agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include inflation  aggregate volume of original participating manufacturers cigarette shipments  other original participating manufacturers and our market share  and aggregate original participating manufacturers operating income  allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases 
the inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year 
the inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for the volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the us states  the district of columbia and puerto rico by the original participating manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the base year shipments 
if volume has increased  the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the base number 
if volume has decreased  the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by of the percentage reduction in volume 
in addition  downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may  subject to specified conditions and exceptions  be reduced in the event of an increase in the original participating manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the state settlement agreements  adjusted for inflation 
any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those original participating manufacturers who have had increases 
during  we paid billion under the state settlement agreements  primarily based on volume 
included in the above number was million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the msa pending resolution of a claim by us and the other original participating manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their msa payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers 
most of the states that are parties to the msa are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings 
our million reduction is based upon the original participating manufacturers collective loss of market share in in april of   and  we had previously deposited million  million  million and million  respectively  in the same escrow account discussed above  which was based on a loss of market share in   and to non participating manufacturers 
in february  we directed the transfer of million from this account to the non disputed account  related to the loss of market share in  pursuant to an agreement concerning arbitration that we and other participating manufacturers entered into with certain msa states 
this amount was then paid to the msa states 
we and other original participating manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of msa payments in subsequent years under provisions of the msa

we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months 
as previously discussed  we have entered into the state settlement agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major us cigarette manufacturers 
our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments  including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys  are based on a number of factors which are described above 
our cash payment under the state settlement agreements in amounted to billion and we estimate our cash payments in under the state settlement agreements will be between billion and billion  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table

we believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
the market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk 
interest rate risk 
our investments  which are included in cash and cash equivalents  consist of money market funds with financial institutions 
those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis  based on a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates on our average investments  would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately million 
our debt is denominated in us dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate 
in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of million to hedge changes in fair value of the notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt 
a sensitivity analysis  based on a hypothetical change in libor  would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately million for liquidity risk 
we may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below ba by moody s or bb by s p 
this could have a negative impact on our cash position 
early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt 
our current moody s debt rating is baa  and our current s p debt rating is bbb  both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required
