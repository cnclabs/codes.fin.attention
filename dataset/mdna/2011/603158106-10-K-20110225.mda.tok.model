table of contents in  the company continued the execution of its growth strategies of geographic expansion and new product development 
during the year  we ramped up production of our first satellite in india  began construction of two additional satellite pcc plants  one in india and one in the us  expanded two of our pcc satellite plants in thailand and brazil  and launched fulfilltm  a new portfolio of pcc products 
in addition  in january  we announced the signing of contracts for the construction of two new satellite pcc plants in india 
the company balance sheet as of december  continues to be very strong 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were approximately million 
our cash flows from operations were in excess of million in in addition  we have available lines of credit of million  our debt to equity ratio was very low at  and our current ratio was we face some significant risks and challenges in the future the industries we serve  primarily paper  steel  construction and automotive  have been adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate 
our global business could be adversely affected by decreases in economic activity 
our refractories segment primarily serves the steel industry 
north american and european steel production improved in from  but was approximately below pre recession levels 
in the paper industry  which is served by our paper pcc product line  production levels for printing and writing papers within north america and europe  our two largest markets improved in but were approximately below pre recession levels

some of our customers may experience shutdowns due to further consolidations  or  may face liquidity issues  which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable  increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses 
consolidations and rationalizations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line 
we continue to rely on china for a significant portion of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment  which may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost 
fluctuations in energy costs have an impact on all of our businesses 
changes in the fair market value of our pension assets  rates of return on assets  and discount rates could have a significant impact on our net periodic pension costs as well as our funding status 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
the company s operations  particularly in the mining and environmental areas discharges  emissions and greenhouse gases  are subject to regulation by federal  state and foreign authorities and may be subject to  and presumably will be required to comply with  additional laws  regulations and guidelines which may be adopted in the future 
the company will continue to focus on innovation and new product development and other opportunities for continued growth as follows develop multiple high filler technologies  such as filler fiber  under the fulfilltm platform of products  to increase the fill rate in freesheet paper and continue to progress with commercial discussions and full scale paper machine trials 
increase our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  particularly in emerging markets 
expand the company pcc coating product line using the satellite model 
promote the company expertise in crystal engineering  especially in helping papermakers customize pcc morphologies for specific paper applications 
expand pcc produced for paper filling applications by working with industry partners to develop new methods to increase the ratio of pcc for fiber substitutions 
develop unique calcium carbonates and talc products used in the manufacture of novel biopolymers  a new market opportunity 
deploy value added formulations of refractory materials that not only reduce costs but improve performance and expand our solid core wire line into bric and other asian countries 
deploy operational excellence principles into all aspects of the organization  including system infrastructure and lean principles 
explore selective acquisitions to fit our core competencies in minerals and fine particle technology

the effective tax rate for was as compared with a tax benefit of in the previous year 
the increase in the tax rate in the current year primarily relates to the decrease in the tax benefit of depletion as a percentage of earnings as well as the geographical mix of earnings 
the factors having the most significant impact on our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion  restructuring and impairments  and the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested 
percentage depletion allowances tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves are available to us under the income tax laws of the united states for operations conducted in the united states 
the tax benefits from percentage depletion were million in  million in  and million in we operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws  tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the united states

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  repay short term and long term debt of million  and repurchase million in treasury shares 
cash provided from operating activities totaled million in as compared with million in the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital  primarily relating to a small increase in inventory levels in as compared a large decrease in  partially offset by higher accounts payable balances 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
working capital is defined as trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and inventories 
working capital increased approximately from december our total days of working capital remained even at days in from the company s days of inventory on hand increased to days in from days in our days of sales outstanding increased to days in from days in our accounts receivable balances increased in december when compared with december primarily due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of the company pension plans are over funded  and presently there are no minimum funding requirements necessary 
on february  the company s board of directors authorized the company s management to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million of shares over a two year period 
as of december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on january   the company board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years after years debt operating lease obligations total contractual obligations we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  the credit lines are primarily in the us  with approximately million or outside the us 
the credit lines are generally one year in term at competitive market rates at large well established institutions 
the company typically uses its available credit lines to fund working capital requirements or local capital spending needs 
at the present time  we have no indication that the financial institutions would be unable to commit to these lines of credit should the need arise 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for should be between million to million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
the company debt to capital ratio is  which is well below the only financial covenant ratio in its debt agreements 
the company has contingent obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  asset retirement obligations  income tax valuation allowances  stock based compensation  and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assur ance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are c onsumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accele rated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  market capitalization below invested capital 
the company conducts its goodwill impairment testing for each reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter with the assistance of valuation specialists 
there is a two step process for testing of goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any impairment 
step one involves a developing the fair value of total invested capital of each reporting unit in which goodwill is assigned  and b comparing the fair value of total invested capital for each reporting unit to its carrying amount  to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value  then the step one test is failed  and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under step two 
the amount of impairment loss is determined in step two by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goo dwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  pcc  processed minerals and refractories 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units in the fourth quarter of the fair value of each reporting unit materially exceeded the carrying value of each reporting unit 

table of contents the goodwill balance for each reporting unit as of december  and  respectively  was as follows in millions december  december  pcc processed minerals refractories total the invested capital for each reporting units as of october  were as follows in millions invested capital pcc processed minerals refractories the fair value of each of its reporting units were materially in excess of the carrying value 
the company had approximately million in cash and short term investments as of october   which would increase both the invested capital and estimated fair values by the same amounts 
we estimate fair value of our reporting units by applying information available at the time of the valuation to industry accepted models using an income approach and market approach 
the income approach incorporates the discounted cash flow method and focuses on the expected cash flow of the reporting unit 
under the market approach  the guideline company method was utilized 
the guideline company method focuses on comparing the reporting units risk profile and growth prospects to selected similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the income and market approaches are equally relevant to the determination of reporting unit fair value and we therefore assigned equal weighting to each method 
the key assumptions we used in the income approach included revenue growth rates and profit margins based upon forecasts derived from available industry market data  a terminal growth rate and estimated weighted average cost of capital based on market participants for which the discount rates were determined 
for the refractories reporting unit  our compound annual sales growth assumption from to is 
our gross profit margin is forecast at between and over the next five years 
the gross profit margin was

the terminal growth rates were projected at after five years  which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth 
we utilized discount rates of and in the valuation and  in addition  incorporated a company specific risk premium 
the key assumptions we used in the market approach represent multiples of sales and ebitda and were derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating characteristics as the reporting units 
the market multiples used in our assumptions ranged from to times forecasted sales and ranged from to times forecasted ebitda 
the impairment testing involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
actual results different from such estimates and assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or 
table of contents increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences and forecasted operating earnings 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and business forecasts to provide insight 
amounts recorded for deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
such year end amounts are expected to be fu lly recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially f rom actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects 
effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of an average long term rate of return of 
while we believe we can achieve a long term average rate of return of  we can not be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations 
from inception through october   assets were strategically allocated among equity  debt and other investments to achieve a diversification level that dampens fluctuations in investment returns 
the company long term investment strategy had an investment portfolio mix of approximately in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
the company year average rate of return on assets through december  was over on its investment assets despite the significant losses realized in 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a capital conservation strategy as a result of the severe market volatility experienced in the latter part of as part of this strategy  the company temporarily invested its pension assets in fixed income securities due to the uncertainty in the markets but had not changed its long term investment strategy 
during the third quarter of  we began a program of systematically moving funds back into equities 
as of december   the company had approximately of its pension assets in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair 
table of contents value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical and implied volatility of the company stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility assumption of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life assumption 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that updates existing disclosure requirements related to supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
under the updated guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires new disclosures  and clarifies existing disclosure requirements  about fair value measurements 
the clarifications and the requirement to separately disclose transfers of instruments between level and level of the fair value hierarchy was effective for interim reporting periods in  however  the requirement to provide purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level roll forward on a gross basis becomes effective in in october  the fasb amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
these amendments  effective in  modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a 
table of contents non software deliverable 
the implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affect ed by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between january and july of the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was a liability of million and million  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward contracts to sell million euros as a hedge of its net investment in europe 
these contracts mature in october the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was a liability of million
