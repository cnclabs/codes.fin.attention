business overview we are a financial holding company headquartered in boca raton  florida 
we follow a business plan that emphasizes the delivery of commercial banking services to businesses and individuals in our geographic market who desire a high level of personalized service 
the business plan includes business banking  professional market services  real estate lending and private banking  as well as full community banking products and services 
the business plan also provides for an emphasis on our small business administration lending program  as well as on small business lending 
we focus on the building of a balanced loan and deposit portfolio  with emphasis on low cost liabilities and variable rate loans 
as is the case with banking institutions generally  our operations are materially and significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve bank and the fdic 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds 
we face strong competition in the attraction of deposits our primary source of lendable funds and in the origination of loans

net interest margin increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the twelve months ended december  non accrual loans at december  represented of total loans compared to at december  the changes in operating results for the period ended december  when compared to the period ended december   and for the balance sheet at december  when compared to december   were substantially a result of the acquisition of tbom and republic 
total assets increased to billion at december  from billion at december  primarily due to the tbom acquisition 
total shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to net earnings for the year 
the percentage of non interest bearing deposits to total deposits was at december  compared to at december  financial condition at december   our total assets were billion and our net loans were million or of total assets 
at december   our total assets were billion and our net loans were million or of total assets 
the increase in net loans from december  to december  was million or 
this increase was mainly attributed to the tbom acquisition which added approximately million in net loans 
during  we had new loan production of approximately million resulting in fundings during the year of approximately million including loans originated for sale which was offset by payoffs  sales  pay downs and charge offs during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
at december   our total deposits were billion  an increase of million over december  of million 
the increase was mainly due to the tbom acquisition in december which added approximately million in deposits as of december  non interest bearing deposits represented of total deposits at december  compared to at december federal home loan advances were million at december  and at december  results of operations we recorded net earnings of million for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  the income for the year was substantially attributed to a gain from the tbom acquisition of million  offset by a million provision for loan losses and acquisition costs of million 
overall operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the tbom acquisition in december  and a full year of operating costs related to the republic acquisition in december we recorded net earnings of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the income for the year was substantially attributed to a gain from the republic acquisition of million  offset by a million provision for loan losses and acquisition costs of million 
overall operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the republic acquisition in december  and a full year of operating costs related to the equitable merger and citrus acquisition in net interest income net interest income  which constitutes the principal source of our income  represents the excess of interest income on interest earning assets over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the principal interest earning assets are federal funds sold  investment securities  and loans 
interest bearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits  interest bearing checking accounts now accounts  savings deposits  money market accounts  fhlb borrowings  and repurchase agreements 
funds attracted by these interest bearing liabilities are invested in interest earning assets 
accordingly  net interest income depends upon the volume of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following table reflects the components of net interest income  setting forth for the periods presented  average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  our net interest spread ie  the average yield on interest earning assets less the average rate on interest bearing liabilities and our net interest margin ie  the net yield on interest earning assets

interest on loans includes loan fees of in  and in b net interest margin is net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets of million or due primarily to the common stock offering in  the republic acquisition in late  and the tbom acquisition in in addition  the net interest margin ie  net interest income divided by average earning assets increased basis points from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   mainly the result of the accretion of a loan discount of million during the year on acquired loans which added approximately basis points to the december  margin 
this amount was partially offset by the decrease of average loans as a percent of earning assets of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  margin was significantly affected by decrease in interest rates paid on deposits  especially the large increase in non interest bearing deposits

net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets of million or due primarily to the equitable merger and citrus acquisition in  and the common stock offering and republic acquisition in this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in net interest margin 
the net interest margin for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by the full impact of decreases in the overnight federal funds rate and st united bank s and the prime lending rate published in the wall street journal which occurred throughout the last quarter of and throughout a substantial portion of st united bank s loans approximately of total loans fluctuate at least quarterly with changes in st united bank s and the wall street journal s prime rate 
since january   st united bank s and the the wall street journal s lending prime rate has decreased from to at december  this decrease had a negative impact on our interest income and margin 
rate volume analysis the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in interest rate and changes in the volume 
changes in both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category

for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million as compared to million for for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in provisioning in and over historical levels was due to the deterioration of market conditions  which resulted in classified loans  an increase in non performing loans  and charge offs during the year

during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of securities resulting in a net gain of  as compared to when we sold million of securities for a net gain of other non interest income increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased fees due to the republic acquisition in late as well as the tbom acquisition in late non interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase of million was mainly the result of a one time recorded gain on acquisition of million due to the republic acquisition 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts have increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in average deposits of in as compared to due primarily from the full year of deposits from the equitable merger and citrus acquisition 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of securities resulting in a net gain of  as compared to where we sold million of securities for a net gain of other non interest income decreased by  to  at december   primarily due to a reduction in prepayment penalty income on loans during as we discussed in the section lending activity in item above  we generally sell the guaranteed portions of sba loans we originate 
gain on sales of loans represents the portion of the gain on such sales that is recognizable under generally accepted accounting principles 
included in other fee income is loan servicing fee income on the portion of sba loans sold 
the amount recognized as income is directly related to the balances of loans outstanding serviced by us 
in addition  we sell most of our first mortgage residential loans  servicing released 
non interest expenses following is a schedule of non interest expense for years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense data processing telephone advertising stationary and supplies amortization of intangibles fdic assessment professional fees acquisition related expenses impairment losses recognized in earnings other non interest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  and other operating expenses incurred in supporting our various business activities 
during the year ended december   non interest expense increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
a substantial portion of the increase in non interest expense was due to the acquisition of republic in late and tbom in late salary and employee benefit costs were million in or million more than  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the republic operation  including three banking centers at the end of in addition  we incurred approximately  in salary and benefits related to employees who worked for us until the completion of the conversion and integration of the republic systems 
as part of the tbom acquisition on december   we added employees and annualized salary and benefit costs of million 
of these positions  we anticipate positions being eliminated by may  in addition  we anticipate expensing in the first half of approximately  in stay bonuses and severance to certain staff who stay through the conversion and integration of tbom 
as part of the tbom acquisition  we added two leased facilities and one owned facility which we will be leasing through may  with an estimated cost for the first five months of of approximately  as these locations will be eliminated  we do not anticipate any additional costs after the second quarter of in january  we also signed a lease for additional space which will result in additional annualized occupancy cost of approximately  data processing costs were million or an increase of  compared to  primarily as a result of the full year of costs related to the increased loans and deposits serviced from the republic acquisition 
professional fees were million  or an increase of million compared to primarily as a result of collection efforts from the increase in non performing loans  classified assets and charge offs during acquisition related costs of million in related primarily to integration  legal and valuation expenses for the tbom acquisition  the termination of leases related to excess space and one time compensation related costs 
other non interest expense of million in increased million compared to primarily due to the full year of operations in from the republic acquisition 
during the year ended december   non interest expense increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
salary and employee benefit costs were million in or  less than the decrease was primarily due to approximately former equitable and citrus bank employees who worked for us until the completion of the conversion and integration of the entities

professional fees were million  or an increase of  compared to primarily as a result of collection efforts from the increase in non performing loans  classified assets and charge offs during the fdic assessment increased due to the increase in deposits during the year as well as a special assessment of  in that the fdic assessed on all financial institutions 
in addition  our assessment rates which also include those for participating in the fdic transactions account guarantee program  increased from to basis points during acquisition related costs of million in related primarily to integration  legal and valuation expenses for the republic acquisition  the termination of leases related to excess space and one time compensation related costs 
other non interest expense of million in increased  compared to primarily due to the full year of operations in from the equitable merger and citrus acquisition 
income tax expense benefit during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax expense of million due to pre tax earnings of million 
in the year ended december   we recognized an income tax expense of million due to pre tax earnings of million 
we recognized an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of our ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled results of operations 
interest rate risk management our net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds  such as non interest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
we manage our assets and liabilities through st united s asset liability committee alco board committee which meets monthly 
management closely monitors st united s three interest risk calculations  reporting the results of its rate stress testing to alco on a quarterly basis 
we have established policy limits of risk  which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income a measure of net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity capital a measure of economic value of equity eve at risk resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for maturities from one day to years 
we measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short term earnings  long term value  and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling 
the simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by us 
when interest rates change  actual movements in different categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  loan prepayments  and withdrawals of time and other deposits  may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model 
finally  the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan customers ability to service their debts  or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan  lease  and deposit products 
our interest rate risk management goal is to avoid unacceptable variations in net interest income and capital levels due to fluctuations in market rates 
management attempts to achieve this goal by balancing  within policy limits  the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched  by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits  and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis 
the balance sheet is subject to testing for interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by plus or minus and basis points bp and plus bp  although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determined are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels 
st united has been consistently within policy limits on rates stress test up and down   and basis points  both for net interest margin and eve 
management has closely monitored st united s gap position which for the most part has been asset sensitive during a rising rate environment 
variations on eve have consistently shown low volatility 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we manage our liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities 
in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities  federal home loan bank advances and brokered time deposits 
we monitor and manage our liquidity position on several bases  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  investment portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
we classify all of our securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining liquidity 
our liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring our loan portfolio interest payments as monthly complemented by retail credit and residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio  resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments 
in managing our investment portfolio  we provide for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature 
our cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities  offset by those provided by operating activities and financing activities  resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million from december  to december   and during we experienced net cash transferred from acquisitions of million and an overall increase in deposits of million 
our securities portfolio  federal funds sold  and cash and due from bank deposit balances serve as primary sources of liquidity for us 
at december   we had cash and due from bank balances of million  and unpledged securities in the amount of million 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec through which we may sell from time to time any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  subscription rights  and units  in one or more offerings 
we may seek to obtain debt or equity financings in the future 
such financings  however  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the loss share agreements with the fdic limit our ability to raise additional equity if a change of control would occur as defined in the loss share agreements 
at december   we had borrowings from the fhlb of million 
at december   we had commitments to originate loans totaling million 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following december  totaled million 
management believes that we have adequate resources to fund all of our commitments  that substantially all of our existing commitments will be funded in the subsequent twelve months and  if so desired  that we can adjust the rates on certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts to retain deposits in a changing interest rate environment 
at december   we had short term lines available from correspondent banks totaling million  frb discount window availability of million and borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million based on collateral pledged  for a total credit available of million 
in addition  being well capitalized  the bank can access the wholesale deposits for approximately million based on current policy limits 
we discuss our securities portfolio  deposits and borrowings further in item business 
capital resources the following table summarizes the changes in our shareholders equity for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  balance at beginning of period issuance of preferred stock redemption of preferred stock registration costs on issuance of common stock sale of common stock exercise of options stock based compensation expense net income preferred stock dividends earned change in unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities balance at end of period the federal banking regulatory authorities have adopted certain prompt corrective action rules with respect to depository institutions 
the rules establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the various federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted regulations to implement the capital rules by  among other things  defining the relevant capital measures for the five capital categories 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order  agreement  or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
at december   st united bank met the capital ratios of a well capitalized financial institution with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a tier leverage ratio of 
depository institutions which fall below the adequately capitalized category generally are prohibited from making any capital distribution  are subject to growth limitations  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
there are a number of requirements and restrictions that may be imposed on institutions treated as significantly undercapitalized and  if the institution is critically undercapitalized  the banking regulatory agencies have the right to appoint a receiver or conservator 
the following represents st united bancorp s regulatory capital ratios for the respective periods well capitalized regulatory requirement december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to total average assets a a tier capital to year end assets is off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients 
at december   we had million in commitments to originate loans and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
we use the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the fhlb  investment security maturities and our revolving credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as either loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers nonclassified loans and is based on historical industry loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and commercial real estate loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of business acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
we acquired first western bank  on april   equitable on february   certain assets of citrus on august   certain assets of republic on december   and the assets of tbom on december  consequently  we were required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective  as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of the reporting unit compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as of december   the required annual impairment test of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
goodwill and intangible assets are described further in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
