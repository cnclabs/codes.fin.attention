this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide the reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results 
our md a is presented in six sections overview results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments summary of critical accounting estimates new accounting standards overview trueblue  inc trueblue  we  us  our is a leading provider of temporary blue collar staffing 
the temporary staffing industry includes a number of markets focusing on business needs that vary widely in duration of assignment and level of technical specialization 
we operate within the blue collar staffing market of the temporary staffing industry 
in  we connected approximately  people to work through the following blue collar staffing brands labor ready for general labor  spartan staffing for light industrial services  clp resources for skilled trades  planetechs for aviation and diesel mechanics and technicians  and centerline for dedicated and temporary drivers 
headquartered in tacoma  washington  we serve approximately  businesses primarily in the services  construction  transportation  manufacturing  retail  and wholesale industries 
as of december   we conducted our staffing services operations through branch offices in all states  puerto rico and canada 
fiscal is a week year ending on the last friday in december 
the final quarter of fiscal consists of weeks 
references to and relate to the week fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
revenue grew to billion for  a increase compared to the prior year 
excluding the rd week of  revenue grew by compared to the strong growth during was primarily driven by the economic recovery across most major geographies and significant industries we serve 
revenues associated with boeing  our largest customer declined in as expected 
excluding the revenue associated with boeing projects and the rd week of  revenue increased compared to net income grew by to million or per diluted share for fiscal as compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal we used our operating leverage to significantly improve our operating results 
the improved operating leverage resulted from utilization of the excess capacity in our branch network and cost reduction actions taken in to support the revenue growth without an increase in expenses 
during the recession we reduced our branch network and consolidated branch management  field management  and substantially all support services while preserving capacity to expand as the economy recovered 
the additional week of revenue during was insignificant to our net income 
customer demand for blue collar staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends towards greater workforce flexibility within the blue collar markets in which we operate 
improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor  resulting in greater demand for our staffing services 
during periods of increasing demand  we are able to improve our profitability by leveraging additional revenue and the associated gross profit across our fixed cost structure 
future growth trends will be dependent on whether the underlying economy continues to improve  trends in customer preference towards a more flexible workforce continue  and we are able to effectively serve customer needs 
given the uncertain nature of economic trends  it is not possible to predict when we will return to pre recession levels of revenue and profitability 
however  we do expect demand for our services to continue to grow during page 
table of contents we are in a strong financial position to fund working capital needs for planned growth and expansion opportunities 
we have cash and cash equivalents of million at december   a increase over the prior year 
as of december   the maximum million was available under the revolving credit facility and million of letters of credit have been issued against the facility  leaving an unused portion of million 
results of operations the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percent of revenue except per share amounts revenue from services cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization income from operations interest and other income  net income before tax expenses income tax expense net income loss net income loss per diluted share revenue from services revenue from services for each of the past three years is as follows in millions revenue from services revenue for increased compared to fiscal is a week year 
excluding the rd week of  revenue grew by compared to the strong growth was primarily driven by the economic recovery across most geographies and significant industries we serve 
further  our customers continue to increase their use of a flexible workforce to meet the demands of the recovering economy 
revenue for decreased compared to this decline was largely related to lower usage of our services as customers reduced their workforces in response to the economic recession 
we began in to scale our cost structure to meet the declining demand for our services 
those efforts continued throughout and helped to ensure our continued profitability and put us in a strong position to face the challenges of the recession and increase profitability as the economy improved

table of contents the change in revenue for each of the past three years includes the following components major revenue trends organic revenue growth decline acquisitions within last months total revenue growth decline organic revenue trends same branch new branches consolidated closed branches additional week percentages for organic revenue trends do not sum to total organic revenue growth decline as same branch growth is determined off a revenue base of branches open for or more months  whereas total organic revenue growth is measured off a total revenue base 
same branch revenue is defined as those branches opened months or more 
new branches are defined as those branches opened less than months 
represents the impact on revenue trends from closed branches assuming no customer retention 
the majority of our closed branches are consolidated with another branch to retain customer relationships 
the impact of retained customers is captured in same branch revenue 
represents revenue growth as a result of an additional week in the year ended december  in comparison with the same period in the prior years 
our quarterly same branch revenue trends in comparison with the same period in prior years are as follows same branch growth decline first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter october november december excluded impact of rd week in order to compare to prior years on a same week basis 
the improvement of our year over year quarterly same branch revenue trends for was due primarily to the economic recovery which was partially offset by the anticipated decline in work associated with boeing projects 
excluding the impact of the revenue associated with boeing and the extra week in the fourth quarter of  same branch revenue growth would have been for the first quarter  for the second quarter  for the third quarter  and for the fourth quarter of gross profit gross profit for each of the past three fiscal years is as follows in millions gross profit gross profit as a of revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal declined as compared to fiscal the decline is primarily due to revenue mix  increased costs associated with our temporary workers  and higher workers compensation expense 
the impact on gross profit from revenue mix is related to two primary factors 
first  brands with a lower gross margin as a percent of revenue which specialize in manufacturing and industrial activities have become a larger portion of our business during the recession and the subsequent recovery 
second  our mix of blue collar staffing business has shifted to service more national and large industrial customers which remained stronger than small to medium sized business during the recession and early stages of the recovery 
these national and large industrial customers have put increased pricing pressure on our gross margins 
page 
table of contents the increased cost of our temporary workers results primarily from increased state unemployment taxes and certain other payroll taxes 
the unemployment tax increases have in part been passed through to our customers 
however  in most cases  the pass through did not include our standard markup 
increased cost of our temporary workers was partially offset by the incentives from the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act which was enacted in march of the hire act provided incentives for hiring and retaining workers by exempting the employer share of the social security tax on wages paid to qualified individuals beginning on march  and expired on december  we recognized million of hire act incentives net of other non recurring payroll tax expense in workers compensation expense was of revenue for versus of revenue for the actual settlement cost of workers compensation claims continues to be less than previously estimated due primarily to the success of our risk management programs 
the success of these programs has resulted in reducing prior estimated claim settlement costs 
however  those reductions were less in as compared to resulting in increased workers compensation expense as a percent of revenue 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for as compared to is primarily due to pricing pressures  increased statutory minimum wages  and revenue mix 
the pricing pressure was due largely to increased price competition as a result of the recession 
our customers requested bill rate decreases and new customers also requested lower bill rates in comparison with historical bill rates 
statutory minimum wages paid to our temporary workers increased in states as well as in canada during while we increased the bill rates to our customers for pay increases  we did not fully pass through the amount of our standard markup due to our customers heightened level of price sensitivity related to slower economic conditions 
workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue for was approximately compared to for  which helped offset the negative impact from minimum wage increases and the drop in construction related revenue which generally produced a higher gross margin in comparison with the blended  overall gross margin of the company 
the improvement in workers compensation expense was due primarily to the continued success of our accident prevention and risk management programs that have been implemented over several years 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue the decline in sg a as a percentage of revenue for was the result of increased revenues without a corresponding increase to sg a 
during periods of increasing demand  we are able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our current cost base can support some increases in business without a similar increase in sg a 
the decrease in sg a during was also due to a combination of cost reduction actions in and aggressive cost containment in we remain focused on leveraging our existing network of branches and support services which will produce a strong incremental operating margin as we continue to leverage our fixed cost structure 
sg a expenses declined by and for and  respectively  in comparison with the prior year 
the decrease in as compared to is largely the result of the aggressive cost management actions taken across the organization in in response to the recession  which included the consolidation of branches  branch management  field management  and substantially all back office support activities  as well as the reduction of various program expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
as a result of this decline  our market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets 
the reduced market capitalization reflected  in part  the economic climate at the time  as well as expected continued weakness in pricing and demand for our temporary staffing services 
as a result of our assessment  we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for the clp  spartan staffing  and centerline reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and we recorded non cash impairment losses totaling million  which was reflected in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december  our assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment indicated that as of december   the fair value of each of the labor ready and planetechs reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
page 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions depreciation and amortization percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased for fiscal as compared to by million from reduced capital spending and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets which have become fully amortized 
depreciation increased for fiscal as compared to by million resulting primarily from investments in technology to improve branch and branch support efficiencies 
the increase was largely offset by million of decreased amortization of intangible assets as a result of their impairment in fiscal interest and other income  net net interest income has declined over the past three years due to a continued decline in investment yields on our restricted and unrestricted cash 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  as compared to in and in excluding the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in  our effective income tax rate in would have been 
the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state and foreign income taxes  federal tax credits  and certain non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate of was lower than our rate of primarily due to the tax benefit related to the favorable development of a federal income tax matter 
our effective tax rate of excluding the effect of the impairment charge was lower than our rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters during results of operations future outlook the following highlights represent our expectations in regard to operating trends for fiscal year these expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy due to our industry s sensitivity to economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy  and the short term nature of staffing assignments  our visibility for future demand is limited 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators as well as certain trends to estimate future revenue trends 
based on these anticipated trends  we expect continued revenue growth in as the economy continues to recover 
however  our revenue growth percentage will diminish due to more challenging prior period revenue comparisons versus the prior period comparables for our expected revenue growth will be partially offset by reduced revenue associated with our largest customer as they complete certain multi year projects 
revenue associated with boeing projects in was million and our expectation for the first quarter of is million which is our best estimate for expected revenue in future quarters 
fiscal will be a week year as compared to fiscal which was a week year 
the extra week in added approximately million to revenue which will negatively impact our growth rate comparisons for versus our top priority is increasing revenue through our existing branch network and improving gross margin 
this will continue to produce strong incremental operating margins as we leverage our fixed cost structure across additional organic revenue 
we will continue to invest in our sales and customer service programs which we believe will enhance our ability to capitalize on further growth and customer retention 
while we do incur additional sg a costs to support additional organic revenue  we will continue to diligently manage our cost structure to meet our goal of producing a strong incremental operating margin on additional organic revenue 
as the economy grows  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence 
all of our multi location brands have opportunities to expand through new physical locations or by sharing existing locations 
where possible we plan to expand the presence of our brands by sharing existing locations to achieve cost synergies 
we plan to build on our success with centralized recruitment and dispatch of our temporary workers to locations without physical branches and expand our geographic reach 
we will also evaluate strategic acquisitions in the blue collar staffing market that can produce strong returns on investment 
our focus is on acquisitions that can accelerate the building of a national presence for a particular brand or that provide an opportunity to serve a new  but sizable portion of the blue collar staffing market 
page 
table of contents federal and state unemployment taxes will increase again in our best estimate of the impact  assuming no action on our part  is an increase that would negatively impact gross margin by of revenue 
we have put in place programs to pass these costs through to our customers 
until the economy fully recovers and state unemployment funds have been replenished and related federal loans repaid by certain states  we expect continued increases to our unemployment taxes and our customers could be resistant to price increases to cover these costs 
we have certain non recurring benefits to our gross margin in the benefits from the hire act for hiring and retaining workers who qualify for certain payroll tax exemptions expired in the benefit of this non recurring program net of other non recurring payroll tax expense was million or nearly basis points of gross margin in likewise  our workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue has been running at approximately during the second half of  which we believe is a reasonable expectation for during the first half of  our workers compensation expense was less than of revenue which contributed to our workers compensation expense for fiscal year of approximately  or of revenue less than our current run rate 
starting in  we will report our organic revenue trends without reference to revenue by branch  which is consistent with our industry 
given our objective of leveraging our existing branch network  increasing our focus on centralized activities  sharing branch offices  and a variety of other factors  we believe reporting revenue as a function of branch count is no longer meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
over the past three fiscal years  net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions net income loss goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts stock based compensation deferred income taxes other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities  exclusive of businesses acquired accounts receivable income taxes workers compensation accounts payable and accrued expenses other net cash provided by operating activities net income for was million as compared to million for due to the recovering economy 
net income was lower in and due to the recession 
results for include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million related to the company s acquisitions since excluding this impairment charge  net income would have been million 
the charge is largely a result of the adverse impact on expected future cash flows related to the global recession 
the charge did not impact the company s cash  liquidity  or compliance with banking covenants 
accounts receivable increased in primarily due to revenue growth which was partially offset by improved collections and a decrease in our days sales outstanding 
the provision for doubtful accounts declined in and reflects the improving economy and ability of our customers to pay 
accounts receivable increased in due to recession and customers extending their payment cycle 
the provision for doubtful accounts for increased as a result of the recession and inability of some customers to pay 
page 
table of contents the change in income taxes during is primarily due to tax refunds claimed in and received in generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as temporary labor services increase and decreases as temporary labor services decline 
during  our workers compensation reserve increased as we increased temporary labor services offset by the timing of payments 
during  the estimated claims decreased as we decreased temporary labor services due to the recession 
changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses during are primarily due to increased accrued payroll taxes associated with increased revenue as a result of the economic recovery and corresponding increases to temporary labor payroll expense  as well as increased unemployment tax rates for partially offset by hire act incentives recognized for hiring and retaining workers who qualify for certain payroll tax exemptions 
conversely during  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to cost control measures  the decline in payroll expense and our response to the economic recession 
cash flows used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions capital expenditures purchases of marketable securities maturities of marketable securities acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired change in restricted cash other net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures in  and were primarily due to significant investments made to upgrade our proprietary information systems 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will be approximately million in we held no marketable securities as of year end december  and made no investments in marketable securities during the and fiscal years 
we had net maturities of marketable securities in acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  included the purchase of two entities 
in march  we purchased substantially all of the assets of tlc  a skilled truck driver staffing provider  for million 
in april  we purchased pmi  an industrial staffing provider  for million 
we are required by our insurance carriers to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation with cash and cash backed instruments  letters of credit  or surety bonds 
during  our insurance carriers released and refunded million of our collateral 
total collateral decreased for however  the mix of restricted cash and letters of credit changed resulting in an increase to restricted cash and a decrease to letters of credit 
page 
table of contents cash flows used in financing activities our cash flows used in financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions purchases and retirement of common stock net proceeds from sale of stock through options and employee benefit plans shares withheld for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock payments on debt other net cash used in financing activities we purchased and retired million shares of our common stock in future outlook we are in a strong financial position to fund working capital needs for planned growth and opportunities to expand into new geographic areas 
the strength of our current financial position is highlighted as follows we have cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  this is an increase of million over the prior year 
our borrowing availability under our credit facility is principally based on accounts receivable and the value of our corporate building 
we have million of borrowing available under our credit facility as of december  we believe the credit facility provides adequate borrowing availability 
the majority of our workers compensation payments are made from restricted cash versus cash from operations 
at december   approximately two thirds of our workers compensation reserve was covered by restricted cash 
on july   we filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which allows us to sell various securities in amounts and prices determined at the time of sale 
the filing enables us to access capital efficiently and quickly if needed pending current market conditions 
as the economy continues to recover  we will continue to aggressively control costs  limit new branch openings and tightly control capital expenditures 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  should economic conditions again deteriorate  our financial results would be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
capital resources on june   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc and bank of america  na  for a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility  which expires in june  replaced our previous million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  na and bank of america  na  which was set to expire in april of as of december   the maximum million was available under the revolving credit facility and million of letters of credit have been issued against the facility  leaving an unused portion of million 
the maximum amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility of million is subject to certain borrowing limits 
we are limited to of the amount of our eligible accounts receivable 
eligible accounts receivable include all accounts receivable less items such as invoices aged over ninety days  cross aged receivables  and other items  plus of the liquidation value of our tacoma headquarters office building not to exceed million  less a reserve in an amount equal to the payroll and payroll taxes for our temporary workers for one payroll cycle  and less other reserves if deemed applicable

the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain liquidity in excess of million 
we are required to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio in the event that liquidity falls below million 
the liquidity level is defined as the amount we are entitled to borrow as advances under the revolving credit facility plus the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts subject to a control agreement benefiting the lenders 
the amount we were entitled to borrow at december  was million and the amount of cash and cash equivalents under control agreements was million for a total of million  which was well in excess of our million liquidity requirement 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility limits the amount of our common stock we can purchase to million during any twelve month period and the aggregate of cash dividends we pay cannot exceed million over the life of the facility  unless we obtain consent from our lenders to increase these amounts 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property and our headquarters located in tacoma  washington 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions that allow us to restrict cash for the purpose of providing cash backed instruments to our insurance carriers to satisfy workers compensation collateral needs 
these instruments include cash backed letters of credit  cash backed bonds  cash held in trusts  as well as cash deposits held by our insurance carriers 
at december   we had restricted cash held primarily by our insurance carriers totaling million 
the majority of our collateral is held by chartis  formerly known as aiu holdings  inc  a subsidiary of american international group  inc 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  is cash held within branch cash dispensing machines cdms for payment of temporary payrolls in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  should economic conditions deteriorate  our financial results would be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
workers compensation collateral and claims reserves we provide workers compensation insurance for our temporary and permanent employees 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses  which are discounted to their estimated net present value

our self insurance reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  as well as those that have been incurred but not reported 
reserves are estimated for claims incurred in the current year  as well as claims incurred during prior years 
management evaluates the adequacy of the workers compensation reserves in conjunction with an independent quarterly actuarial assessment 
factors we consider in establishing and adjusting these reserves include the estimates provided by our independent actuary and appropriate discount rates 
factors considered by our independent actuary include  among other things changes in medical and time loss indemnity costs  mix changes between medical only and indemnity claims  regulatory and legislative developments that have increased benefits and settlement requirements  mix changes among brands or types of work within a brand  the impact of safety initiatives implemented  and positive or adverse development of claim reserves 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
however  we have full liability for all remaining payments on claims that originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december prior to  we were insured by various carriers who are now insolvent and as a result we are substantially reserved for any claims above the self insurance limit

two of the workers compensation insurance companies troubled insurance companies with which we formerly did business are in liquidation and have failed to pay a number of excess claims to date 
these excess claims have been presented to the state guaranty funds of the states in which the claims originated

our workers compensation insurance policies are renewed annually 
we had coverage with chartis for occurrences during the period from july to july and renewed our coverage with chartis effective july to july we are also self insured with certain state workers compensation programs  which are typically renewed on an annual basis 
workers compensation collateral our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation  for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
the collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash backed instruments  letters of credit  and or surety bonds 
on a regular basis these entities assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
we generally anticipate that our collateral obligations will continue to grow 
we pay our premiums and deposit our collateral in installments

summary of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation reserves we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout page 
table of contents the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the income statement in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our self insured limits excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount the reserve and its corresponding receivable to its respective estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
there are two main factors that impact workers compensation expense the number of claims and the cost per claim 
the number of claims is driven by the volume of hours worked  the business mix which reflects the type of work performed  and the safety of the environment where the work is performed 
the cost per claim is driven primarily by the severity of the injury  the state in which the injury occurs  related medical costs and lost time wage costs 
a change in the number of claims or cost per claim would impact workers compensation expense by approximately million 
we have not had significant changes in the assumptions used in calculating our reserve balance 
however  our reserve balances have been positively impacted primarily by the success of our accident prevention programs 
in the event that we are not able to further reduce our accident rates  the positive impacts to our reserve balance will diminish 
stock based compensation under various plans  officers  employees and non employee directors have received or may receive grants of stock  stock units  or options to purchase common stock 
compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  based on the stock s fair market value on the grant date 
for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions  compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche 
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest  rather than record forfeitures when they occur 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in the future periods 
we determine the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
we recognize expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and record adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates 
based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
we consider our brands labor ready  spartan staffing  clp resources  planetechs and centerline to be reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
in fiscal  and  there were no material changes to our reporting units other than new reporting units created as a result of acquisitions in the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 
the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
then  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that page 
table of contents goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess  not to exceed the carrying value 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
based on our test  the fair market value of our reporting units was substantially greater than net book value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit 
critical assumptions include projected revenue growth  gross profit rates  selling  general and administrative expense rates  working capital fluctuations  capital expenditures and terminal growth rates  as well as an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
discount rates are determined using the capital asset pricing model 
we also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 
we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we have indefinite lived intangible assets related to our clp resources and spartan staffing trade names 
we test our trade names annually for impairment  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each of our trade names 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess 
considerable management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions  including projected revenue  royalty rates and appropriate discount rates 
an impairment assessment of physical assets is necessary whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in such cases  the asset must be written down to the greater of the net realizable value or fair market value 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal  state  and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws  taxes  workers compensation  immigration  and safety 
from time to time we are also subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that an insurance company is contractually obligated to reimburse us for a liability  we record a receivable for the amount of the probable reimbursement 
we evaluate our reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as changes to federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
as of december   our purchased investments included in cash and cash equivalents had maturities of less than days 
therefore  an increase or decrease in interest rates immediately and uniformly by from our year end levels would not have a material effect upon our cash and cash equivalent balances  operating results or cash flows 
we have a certain amount of assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to our international operations 
we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk and we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results or cash flows
