table of contents overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
for the year ended december   we incurred a consolidated net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the same period in as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest receivable totaling million compared to million as of december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp transcription factors zfp tfs and zfp nucleases zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner funding will continue beyond their initial terms 
in the development of our zfp technology platform  we have continued to place more emphasis internally on higher value zfp therapeutic product development and less on our non therapeutic applications 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject us to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we have filed investigational new drug ind applications with the us food and drug administration fda and have initiated several phase clinical trials and a phase b clinical trial of a zfp therapeutic in subjects with diabetic neuropathy and one phase clinical trial in subjects with als 
we are also conducting phase clinical trials to evaluate zfp therapeutics for the treatment of hiv aids and glioblastoma  a type of brain cancer 
development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products will be gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  stock based compensation expenses  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing expenses  allocated facilities expenses  subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase as we focus on the development of zfp therapeutics 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially viable therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future licensee s product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we estimate the performance period at the inception of the arrangement and reevaluate it each reporting period 
this reevaluation may shorten or lengthen the period over which the remaining revenue is recognized 
changes to these estimates are recorded on a prospective basis 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which have not been earned 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
research and development expenses we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist of direct and research related allocated overhead costs such as facilities costs  salaries and related personnel costs  and material and supply costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include costs related to clinical trials to validate our testing processes and procedures and related overhead expenses 
expenses resulting from clinical trials are recorded when incurred based in part on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 

table of contents stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee share purchase plan espp  on estimated fair values  utilizing the modified prospective transition method 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method 
to estimate the value of an award  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected life  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
while estimates of expected life and volatility are derived primarily from our historical data  the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and  as a result  it is likely we will change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
further  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements research grants total revenues total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and research grants 
we anticipate revenues over the next several years will primarily be derived from our research and commercial license agreements with sigma aldrich corporation sigma and our research license and commercial option agreement with dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned subsidiary of dow chemical corporation 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  million in and million in the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased revenues of million in connection with our license agreement with das which was mainly due to a decrease in amortized revenues associated with the commercial option fee paid by das in june the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased revenues of million in connection with our license agreements with sigma and increased revenues of million in connection with our agreement with das  partially offset by decreased revenues of million in connection with our research and commercial license agreements with pfizer inc research grant revenues were million in   in and million in the increase in from was primarily due to increased revenues associated with several existing and new 
table of contents research grants 
in  revenue associated with our grant with the juvenile diabetes research foundation international jdrf increased million due to progress on our phase b clinical trial for dn 
revenue associated with our grant with the michael j 
fox foundation for parkinson s research mjff increased  due to renewed funding from mjff to support further studies of zfp tf activators of gdnf 
additionally  in  we began recognition of revenues associated with a grant from the california institute of regenerative medicine cirm 
cirm revenues were  in lastly  in october  we were awarded and recognized  for four qualifying therapeutic discovery projects under the patient protection and affordable care act 
the decrease in from was primarily attributable to decreased revenues of  related to our grant with jdrf and decreased revenues of  related to our grant with mjff 
operating expenses year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing expenses  allocated facilities expenses  subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of million in from was primarily due to increased clinical expenses related to dn  specifically our phase b study 
the decrease of million in from was primarily due to decreased pre clinical studies expenses of million  primarily related to our hiv aids and glioblastoma programs  and related decreases in consulting expenses of  and laboratory supplies expenses of  the decrease was partially offset by increased expenses related to salaries and personnel of million  including increased stock based compensation expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expenses was primarily due to a true up of actual versus previously estimated forfeitures of stock option grants 
our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for neurological disorders  hiv aids  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp engineered cell lines for protein production and generation of transgenic animals  and zfp tfs and zfns for applications in agricultural biotechnology 

table of contents below is a summary of our programs partially funded by collaborators and the development phase of the leading application program collaborator stage zfp technology for high value laboratory research reagents including zfn engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals and generation of transgenic animals sigma aldrich corporation research marketing zfp technology to modify the genomes or alter the protein expression of plant cells  plants  or plant cell cultures dow agrosciences research marketing below is a summary of our programs funded internally and the development stage of the leading application program stage zfp therapeutics research preclinical clinical drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation and gene modification technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
prior to january   due to the early stage of our various internal research and development programs  we did not track associated expenses on a program by program basis 
since january   management has categorized research and development expenses by program 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  sb and sb t  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects and activity associated with various research collaborations 
year ended december  in thousands programs sb sb t other research and development projects total research and development expenses general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation  professional services expenses  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in there were no significant changes in general and administrative expenses in from the increase of million in from was primarily due to personnel related expenses of million  including 
table of contents increased stock based compensation of million  as well as increased professional services expenses of  the increase in stock based compensation expenses was primarily due to a true up of actual versus previously estimated forfeitures of stock option grants 
interest income  net year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values interest income  net interest income  net  was  in  compared to  in and million in the decrease in from was due to lower investment yields and lower average investment balances 
the decrease in from was primarily due to lower investment yields 
other income expense year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values other income expense other income expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses related to the cash balance held by our wholly owned uk subsidiary  gendaq limited 
the cash balance was transferred to sangamo s us investment account in the third quarter of  accordingly  there were no foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses during the income in compared to the expense in was due to fluctuations in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception  we have incurred significant annual net losses and we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators and strategic partners and research grants 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest receivable totaling million compared to million as of december  the decrease was primarily attributable to capital required to fund our continuing operations  including the advancement of our zfp therapeutic programs 
our most significant use of capital pertains to salaries and benefits for our employees and external development expenses  such as manufacturing and clinical trial activity  related to our zfp therapeutic programs 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  us treasury debt securities  corporate debt securities and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy with a view toward capital preservation and liquidity 
cash flow net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in for all periods  net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects our net operating losses 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and deferred revenues under our 
table of contents million license agreement with sigma  which was received in full in october but which was recognized through july the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily the result of increased revenues association with our collaboration agreements 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in cash flows from investing activities for all periods primarily related to purchases and maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in and primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
in  in addition to proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options  we generated cash flows related to issuance of common stock in connection with an expanded license agreement with sigma and an underwritten public offering 
in october  pursuant to the expanded license agreement with sigma  sangamo issued  shares of common stock valued at per share to sigma  resulting in proceeds of million 
additionally  in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock  in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate continuing to incur operating losses for at least the next several years 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular to support our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources as well as funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and research grants will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through future capital requirements will be substantial and if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations  including zfp therapeutic development activities through equity or debt financing 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  or if the terms of potential funding sources are unfavorable  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
furthermore  any sales of additional equity securities may result in dilutions to our stockholders 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors  including the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of product candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  the timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution capabilities  the cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  and the possible costs of litigation 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have only incurred losses since the inception of the company 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net federal and 
table of contents state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
the company also has federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in while the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards before use 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees associated with cancelable in license patent agreements 
recent accounting pronouncement in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple elements 
the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element arrangements guidance 
the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables 
these changes are likely to result in earlier recognition of revenue for multiple element arrangements than under previous guidance 
these new standards are effective for annual periods ending after june  and are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  however  early adoption is permitted 
we believe the new standards will impact new or modified arrangements and may likely result in less revenue deferral 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash  cash equivalents and investments  which have maturities not to exceed one year 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and capturing a market rate of return based on our investment policy parameters and market conditions 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in securities of high credit quality and with varying maturities to match projected cash needs 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
our investments currently consist of us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
