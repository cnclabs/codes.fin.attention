overview we are a leading provider of money movement services  operating in two business segments consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers  primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency  real time money transfer processing systems 
this service is available for international cross border transfers that is  the transfer of funds from one country to another and  in certain countries  intra country transfers that is  money transfers from one location to another in the same country 
global business payments the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses 
our business payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations  including utilities  auto finance companies  mortgage servicers  financial service providers  government agencies and other businesses 
in september  we acquired canada based custom house  ltd 
custom house  a provider of international business to business payment services  which is included in this segment 
custom house  which has been rebranded western union business solutions business solutions in september  facilitates cross border  cross currency payment transactions 
the international expansion and other key strategic initiatives have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment 
however  the majority of the segment s revenue was generated in the united states during all periods presented 
businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as other and primarily include our money order services  and represented or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended december   and prior to october   the company s money orders were issued by integrated payment systems inc ips  a subsidiary of first data corporation first data  to consumers at retail locations primarily in the united states and canada 
effective october   we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders 
also included in other are expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings  including costs to develop mobile money transfer services  new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions

the acquisition of custom house contributed million and million to revenue for and  respectively 
we incurred million of restructuring and related expenses as described within operating expenses overview

no restructuring and related expenses were recognized in 
table of contents we generated  million in consolidated operating income compared to  million in the prior year  representing an increase of 
the current year results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above 
the prior year results included an accrual of million resulting from an agreement and settlement which includes the resolution of all outstanding legal issues and claims with the state of arizona and a multi state agreement to fund a not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border the settlement accrual

consolidated net income was million  representing an increase of from the current year results include million in restructuring and related expenses  net of tax 
the prior year results include the settlement accrual of million  net of tax 
our consumers transferred billion in consumer to consumer principal  of which billion related to cross border principal  which represented an increase of in both consumer to consumer principal and cross border principal over the prior year 
consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were million  a decrease of over this decrease was primarily the result of a million refundable tax deposit we made relating to potential united states federal tax liabilities  including those arising from our international restructuring  which have been previously accrued for in our financial statements 
we issued million of aggregate principal amount of our notes due notes during the year ended december  we exchanged million of aggregate principal amount of our notes due notes for million aggregate principal amount of effective rate of notes due notes during the year ended december  our strategic priorities for ensuring our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our retail channels  expanding our electronic channels to offer more choice and gain new consumers  developing new products and services for our consumers and improving our processes and productivity to help drive growth and improve our profitability 
significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses 
transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by  among other things  the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  a reduction in the size of the migrant population  interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns or political events  could adversely affect our transaction volume 
for discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods  refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below 
revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers  the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
we intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors 
decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
a majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions  which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue 
the impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program

transaction fees transaction fees are charged for sending money transfers and for global business payments services 
consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent and received 
transaction fees represented of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenues in certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different currencies  we generate revenues based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
foreign exchange revenues growth has historically been primarily driven by growth in international cross currency transactions 
as a result of the acquisition of custom house  our foreign exchange revenues have increased

although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement ie  spot rate changes  the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur 
derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer to consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions 
gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our international business to business payments operations 
the impact of these contracts is classified within foreign exchange revenues in the consolidated statements of income

results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended december  compared to the same period in and the year ended december  compared to the same period in the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations  which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income

compared to consolidated revenue increased during the year ended december  due to consumer to consumer transaction growth and the acquisition of custom house  which contributed million to revenue in and million in transaction growth and incremental custom house revenue were offset by price decreases  primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business transactions between and within the united states and canada commencing in the fourth quarter of  declines in our united states bill payments businesses  geographic and product mix  including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  which has a lower revenue per transaction  and the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies  which negatively impacted revenue 
the europe  middle east  africa and south asia emeasa region of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced flat 
table of contents revenue despite transaction growth 
transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the united states dollar in the region compared to most other foreign currencies  which negatively impacted revenue  and many of the same factors described above 
the americas region including north america  latin america  the caribbean and south america of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue increases due to strong transaction growth  although the increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of the global business payments segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion  also experienced revenue growth during the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to our acquisition of custom house  which was partially offset by declines in our united states bill payments businesses 
foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended december  over primarily due to foreign exchange revenues contributed from our acquisition of custom house 
in addition to the impact of custom house  foreign exchange revenues in the consumer to consumer segment also grew  driven primarily by revenue from the international business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction of transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended december  of million over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the largest impact was related to the emeasa region 
compared to consolidated revenue declined during the year ended december  the revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth  and to a lesser extent  geographic mix  product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions  and price decreases 
also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year  which adversely impacted revenue by approximately  as discussed below 
the emeasa region of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
the revenue declines were driven by most of the same factors discussed above 
the acquisition of fexco s money transfer business did not have an impact on our revenue as we were already recognizing of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at fexco s locations 
the americas region of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue and transaction declines due to the overall weak united states economy 
our americas results were further impacted by pricing reductions taken in the united states in the fourth quarter of which improved our transaction volumes  but contributed to the decline in revenue 
the global business payments segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion  also experienced revenue declines during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding prior period 
revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the united states  which resulted in a revenue decline in our united states cash and electronic bill payments businesses 
offsetting these declines in were the results of our custom house acquisition  which contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended december  over primarily due to foreign exchange revenues from business solutions 
excluding the impact of business solutions  foreign exchange revenues decreased at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents of million over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the impact to earnings per share during the period was less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program 
the majority of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is related to the emeasa region 
operating expenses overview the following factors impacted both cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses during the periods presented restructuring and related activities on may  and as subsequently revised  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the restructuring plan designed to reduce our overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities  primarily within the united states and europe  to regional operating centers upon completion of the restructuring plan 
in conjunction with this decision and subsequent revisions  we expect to incur approximately million in additional expenses in related to the restructuring plan 
the total expense for and of approximately million consists of approximately million for severance and employee related benefits  approximately million for facility closures  including lease terminations  and approximately million for other expenses 
included in these estimated expenses are approximately million of non cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities 
subject to complying with and undertaking the necessary individual and collective employee information and consultation obligations as may be required by local law for potentially affected employees  we expect all of these activities to be completed by the third quarter of total cost savings of approximately million were generated in and approximately million is expected to be generated in cost savings of approximately million per year are expected to be generated beginning in  following completion of the restructuring plan 
for the year ended december   restructuring and related expenses of million are classified within cost of services and million are classified within selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income 
no restructuring and related expenses were recognized in for the year ended december   restructuring and related expenses of million and million are classified within cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
these restructuring and related expenses are associated with the closure of our facilities in missouri and texas and other reorganization plans executed in no expenses were recognized for these restructurings in cost of services cost of services increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to incremental costs  including those related to custom house  our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives  including our web and account based money transfer services  agent commissions  which primarily increase in relation to revenue increases  and restructuring and related expenses of million  offset by operating efficiencies  primarily decreased bad debt expense 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was for both of the years ended december  and as incremental operating costs  including costs associated with our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives  including our web and account based money transfer services  and restructuring and related expenses were offset by operating efficiencies  primarily decreased bad debt expense 
cost of services decreased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to agent commissions  which decreased due to revenue declines  as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of fexco and other selective consumer to consumer commission initiatives 
also impacting cost of services was the strengthening of the united states dollar for most of compared to most other foreign currencies  which resulted in a favorable impact on the translation of our expenses  and restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in and the related cost savings 
these costs were offset by incremental operating costs  including increased technology costs and costs associated with custom house 
cost of 
table of contents services as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was generally due to reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of fexco and selective consumer to consumer agent commission initiatives  restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in and the related cost savings  offset somewhat by incremental operating costs  including increased technology costs and costs associated with custom house 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual that was recorded in  as described below  lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies  offset by incremental costs associated with custom house and our retail expansion in europe pursuant to the payment services directive  restructuring and related expenses of million and higher employee compensation costs 
sg a increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual described below  incremental costs associated with the acquisitions of fexco and custom house including costs related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other increased operating expenses  offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses  and restructuring costs incurred in which did not recur in during the year ended december   we recorded an accrual of million for an agreement and settlement with the state of arizona and other states 
on february   we signed this agreement and settlement  which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the state and requires us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border  in which california  texas and new mexico will participate with arizona 
the accrual includes amounts for reimbursement to the state of arizona for its costs associated with this matter 
in addition  as part of the agreement and settlement  we expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the united states and mexico border and have engaged a monitor for those programs  which are expected to cost up to million over the period from signing to during the years ended december   and  marketing related expenditures  principally classified within sg a  were approximately   and  respectively  of revenue 
marketing related expenditures include advertising  events  loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities 
when making decisions with respect to marketing investments  we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments  as discussed in segment discussion  for consumer to consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments 
total other expense  net total other expense  net increased during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from our million note issuance and financing costs incurred in connection with our note exchange  and a decrease in interest income due to lower short term interest rates and the repayment of a note receivable due from an agent 
these amounts were partially offset by the recovery of million of the million reserve recorded in the prior year against our receivable from the reserve international liquidity fund due to the final settlement 
total other expense  net increased during the year ended december  compared to due to a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower average interest bearing cash balances  the reserve taken against our receivable from the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd 
mentioned above and a decline in earnings on our equity method investments in  primarily as a result of the absence of equity method earnings for fexco subsequent to the february acquisition date 
income taxes our effective tax rates on pre tax income were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived  
table of contents and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
in addition  during  we have also benefitted from cumulative and ongoing tax planning benefits  including benefits related to certain previous foreign acquisitions  and from certain irs settlements related to through we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures  including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in as of december   the total amount of tax contingency reserves was million  including accrued interest and penalties  net of related benefits 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows 
the irs completed its examination of the united states federal consolidated income tax returns of first data for and  of which we are a part  and issued a notice of deficiency in december the notice of deficiency alleges significant additional taxes  interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries  and we generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these potential western union related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement with first data executed at the time of the spin off 
we agree with a number of the adjustments in the notice of deficiency  however  we do not agree with the notice of deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of approximately million 
as of december   interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments would be approximately million 
a substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates to our international restructuring  which took effect in the fourth quarter  and  accordingly  the alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are attributable to on march   we filed a petition in the united states tax court contesting those adjustments with which we do not agree 
in september  irs counsel referred the case to the irs appeals division for possible settlement 
we believe our overall reserves are adequate  including those associated with adjustments alleged in the notice of deficiency 
if the irs position in the notice of deficiency is sustained  our tax provision related to and later years would materially increase  which could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in  we made a million refundable tax deposit relating to potential united states federal tax liabilities  including those arising from our international restructuring  which have been previously accrued in our financial statements 
making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax liabilities  to the extent of the deposit 
the million refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction to income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  earnings per share during the years ended december   and  basic earnings per share were  and  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively 
unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested 
as of december   and  there were million  million and million  respectively  of outstanding options to purchase shares of western union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti dilutive 
the increase in anti dilutive shares in and compared to was primarily due to the majority of our outstanding options having an exercise price higher than our average market price for the years ended december  and of the million  million and million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of december   and  respectively  approximately  and  respectively  were held by employees of first data 

table of contents earnings per share increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding previous period as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income and lower weighted average shares outstanding 
earnings per share decreased for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income  offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
the lower number of shares outstanding was due to stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in both and compared to the corresponding periods in the prior years

when referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for individual countries in the following discussion  all transactions to  from and within those countries  and of the revenue associated with each transaction to  from and within those countries are included 
the countries of india and china combined represented approximately  and of our consolidated revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  represented more than approximately  and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues compared to for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  consumer to consumer money transfer revenue grew primarily due to transaction growth of 
transaction growth was offset by price decreases  primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of  geographic and product mix  including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  and the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies  which negatively impacted revenue by approximately 
our international consumer to consumer business experienced revenue growth of on transaction growth of for the year ended december  our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the united states and canada and transactions to and from mexico

transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors described above 
our european market experienced transaction growth during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
in addition  for the full year ended december   revenue and transactions in the gulf states declined moderately compared to the same period in  however  both revenue and transactions grew in the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable period in the prior year 
india had transaction growth of and revenue growth of for the year ended december  versus the same period in americas revenue increased on transaction growth of for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to the pricing actions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of our domestic business experienced revenue declines of on transaction growth of for the year ended december  due to the same factors 
however  in the fourth quarter of  our domestic business experienced revenue growth of on transaction growth of as we reached the anniversary of the pricing reductions taken in the fourth quarter of our united states outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended december  our mexico business revenue was flat during the year ended december  on transaction growth of 
apac revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to transaction growth of 
china s revenue increased on transaction growth of for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  grew compared to the prior year  driven primarily by revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  of million over the same period in the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the largest impact was related to the emeasa region 
we have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account a variety of factors 
fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally can reduce margins in the short term  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
for the year ended december   such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately of our total revenue compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the full year  approximately three fourths of these actions relate to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business 
the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations  new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  is often experienced as locations mature 
we believe that new agent locations will help 
table of contents drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
we generally refer to locations with more than of transactions being initiated versus paid as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations 
send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue 
they contribute more transactions per location than receive locations 
however  a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers 
the number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  migration patterns  the location s class of trade  hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering our services  regulatory limitations and competition 
each of the more than  agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services  however  not every location completes a transaction in a given period 
for example  as of december   more than of agent locations in the united states  canada and western europe representing at least one of our three money transfer brands western union  orlandi valuta sm and vigo experienced money transfer activity in the previous months

we periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions 
compared to consumer to consumer money transfer revenue declined on transaction growth of for the year ended december  over the revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth  and to a lesser extent  geographic mix  product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions  and price decreases 
also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year  which adversely impacted revenue by approximately  as discussed below 
our international consumer to consumer business experienced a revenue decline of on transaction growth of for the year ended december  our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states also experienced revenue declines on transaction increases for the year ended december  as a result of the same factors described above 
revenue in our emeasa region declined during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to most of the same factors discussed above 
our largest european markets experienced revenue declines during most of the year ended december  as compared to the same period in our money transfer business to india for the year ended december  versus the same period in continued to grow with transaction growth of and revenue growth of 
revenue and transaction growth for both india and the gulf states slowed throughout the year ended december  compared to due to the economic conditions in the gulf states  transaction growth rates declined to single digits in the fourth quarter 
americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in contributing to the overall decline in the americas region was the domestic business which experienced a revenue decline of on a transaction decline of for the year ended december  the repositioning of the domestic business  including pricing reductions taken in the united states in the fourth quarter of  improved our americas and domestic transaction volumes  but contributed to the decline in revenue 
our mexico business also contributed to the overall decline in the americas region with a revenue decline of on a transaction decline of for the year ended december  our united states domestic and mexico business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the united states 
our mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of certain vigo branded agents  substantially all of which were small retailers  due to credit concerns 
however  the decline in revenue for our united states outbound business moderated in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous nine months of as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth quarter of our apac revenue increased on transaction growth of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the apac region s revenues have been impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the united states dollar  as further described below  as well as moderating transaction growth 
china revenue grew on transaction growth for the year ended december  
table of contents foreign exchange revenues decreased for the year ended december  over the corresponding previous period at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended december  of million over the same period in the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
operating income compared to consumer to consumer operating income increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies  primarily decreased bad debt expense  offset by higher employee compensation costs and incremental costs associated with our retail expansion in europe pursuant to the payment services directive 
the increase in operating income margin for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from these same factors 
compared to consumer to consumer operating income decreased during the year ended december  compared to due to the decline in revenue  incremental costs  including increased technology costs and the acquisition of fexco  offset somewhat by reduced agent commissions  savings realized from the restructurings and better leveraging of our marketing expenses  as described earlier

these increases were offset by revenue declines in our united states bill payments businesses as many united states consumers who would use our services continue to have difficulty paying their bills and continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form  resulting in us handling fewer bill payments 
the ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the 
table of contents united states and competitive pressures  which resulted in lower cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products  also contributed to the revenue declines 
the transaction declines during the year ended december  compared to the same period in were due to declines in our united states bill payments businesses 
compared to during the year ended december   the global business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the united states  which resulted in a revenue decline in our united states cash and electronic bill payments businesses  partially offset by million in revenue generated from our september  acquisition of custom house and slight growth in the pago f cil business 
the segment s revenues were primarily generated in the united states for the year ended december  transaction growth during the year ended december  compared to was driven by our pago f cil cash based and united states electronic based bill payments businesses 
both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction than our united states cash based bill payment business 
the transaction growth was offset by a decline in the united states cash based bill payments business 
operating income compared to for the year ended december   operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines related to the united states based bill payments business  and investing and operating costs  including amortization expense  associated with the acquisition of custom house 
the decline in operating income margin in the segment is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the acquisition of custom house and declines in our united states bill payments businesses 
compared to for the year ended december   operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to operating income declines related to the united states based bill payments business and operating and integration costs associated with the acquisition of custom house  offset slightly by the savings generated from the restructurings 
the decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the decline in the united states cash based bill payments business which has a higher operating income margin than our south america and electronic businesses

we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned 
table of contents related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of from ips on outstanding money order balances as we did for the first three quarters of we now derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets  which are primarily held in united states tax exempt state and municipal debt securities 
these securities generally have a lower rate of return than we were receiving under our previous agreement with ips 
in  we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
through a combination of the revenue generated from the new investment securities and the anticipated interest expense savings resulting from the interest rate swaps  we estimate that we should be able to retain a materially comparable after tax rate of return through as we had been receiving under the agreement with ips 
compared to revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is comprised primarily of our money order services business 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned related to our money order services business due to the change in our agreement with ips described above 
operating income compared to during the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our money order services business  as described above  and an increase in promotional marketing activities related to our prepaid business in the united states 
in  we also incurred additional costs associated with evaluating and closing acquisitions compared to compared to during the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of as described above 
further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue  operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities  primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital 
our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings  timing of income tax payments  including our refundable tax deposit described further in cash flows from operating activities and collections on receivables  among other items 
the majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters  and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters 
our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors  some of which are out of our control  including changes in economic conditions  especially those impacting the migrant population  and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits  including the resolution of outstanding tax matters 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries  some of which are regulated entities 
these subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use  except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
the assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions of approximately million include those located in countries outside of the united states containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained by a regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the united states in accordance with applicable state regulations 
significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity 

table of contents we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs  including the pending acquisition of angelo costa srl  dividends  and share repurchases  through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations 
in addition  we have capacity to borrow up to billion in the aggregate under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility  which were not drawn on as of and during the year ended december  the revolving credit facility expires in september cash and investment securities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which billion was held by our foreign entities 
our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause united states and foreign cash balances to fluctuate 
repatriating foreign funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally 
in many cases  we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions 
these funds  referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are not used to support our operations 
however  we earn income from investing these funds 
we maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments  classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets  to fund settlement obligations 
investment securities  classified within settlement assets  were billion as of december  substantially all of these investments are state and municipal debt securities 
most state regulators in the united states require us to maintain specific high quality  investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations 
substantially all of our investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
under the payment services directive psd in the european union  we expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities  which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current portfolio 
investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments  including diversifying our investment portfolio 
as of december   the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration 
as of december   all investments with a single issuer and each individual security was less than of our investment securities portfolio 
cash flows from operating activities during the years ended december   and  cash provided by operating activities was million   million and  million  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from to  primarily due to a million refundable tax deposit made relating to potential united states federal tax liabilities  including those arising from our international restructuring  which have been previously accrued in our financial statements 
making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax liabilities  to the extent of the deposit 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from to due to lower net income  offset by working capital fluctuations in  including the settlement accrual and timing of tax payments

the changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the related note 
these hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in interest expense over the life of the related notes  and cause the effective rate of interest to differ from the notes stated rate 
b on march   we exchanged million of aggregate principal amount of the notes due notes for unsecured notes due notes

as of and during the year ended december   we had no outstanding borrowings on this facility and had billion available to borrow 
our revolving credit facility  which is diversified through a group of participating institutions  is used to provide general liquidity for us and to support our commercial paper program  which we believe enhances our short term credit rating 
the largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of billion is approximately 
the substantial majority of the banks within this group were rated at least an a or better as of december  if the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased  or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated  the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted

credit ratings and debt covenants the credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms 
factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings  cash flow generation  leverage  available liquidity and overall business risks 

table of contents our revolving credit facility contains an interest rate margin  facility fee and utilization fee  all of which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions in our notes  notes and certain of our derivative contracts which would require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade

however  as market conditions allow  we may refinance all or a portion of the notes with new financing sources 
we have the ability to use existing financing sources  including our cash  revolving credit facility and commercial paper program  to meet obligations as they arise 
based on market conditions at the time such refinancing could occur  we may not be able to obtain new financing under similar conditions as historically reported 
our ability to continue to grow the business  make acquisitions  return capital to shareholders  including share repurchases and dividends  and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries  our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy

pension plan on december   we merged our two frozen defined benefit pension plans into one plan the plan 
the plan assets were held in a master trust and were identical in terms of their benefit entitlements and other provisions except for participant eligibility requirements and consequently  the financial effect of the merger was not significant 
our plan had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of million as of december  in we made approximately million in contributions to the plan  including a discretionary contribution of million 
due to the closure of one of our facilities in missouri and an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation  we funded million during no contributions were made to the plan during the year ended december  we will be required to fund approximately million to the plan in and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million 
our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was december  the calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions expected long term return on plan assets  and discount rate 
we employ a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
consideration is given to diversification  re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held 
historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness 
we then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets 
the calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period 
our expected long term return on plan assets was for and for the expected long term return on plan assets is for in early we revised our target asset allocation to approximately in equity investments  in fixed income securities and in alternative investment strategies in order to increase diversification 
the discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively 
the discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the plan to the rates from an aa spot rate yield curve 
the curve is derived from aa bonds of varying maturities 
the discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was and at december  and  respectively 
a basis point change to both the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years items related to amounts included on our balance sheet borrowings  including interest a unrecognized tax benefits b estimated pension funding c foreign currency derivative contracts d other e other contractual obligations purchase obligations f operating leases other g a we have estimated our interest payments based on i the assumption that we will continue to have no commercial paper borrowings outstanding ii the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes  although we intend to refinance in the remaining balance of million of our notes which are scheduled to mature in november and iii an estimate of future interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements based on projected libor rates 
b unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties 
the timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control 
c we have estimated our pension plan funding requirements  including interest  using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates 
the unfunded pension liability included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is the present value of the estimated pension plan funding requirements disclosed above 
the actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated 
in addition  we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million to the plan in  which has not been reflected in the table above 
d represents the liability position of our foreign currency derivative contracts as of december   which will fluctuate based on market conditions 
e this line item relates to accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of december  f many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a terminations penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 
obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations 
g this line item primarily relates to the agreement we entered into on december  to acquire the remaining interest  which we currently do not own  in angelo costa srl  one of our largest money transfer agents in europe

other commercial commitments we had million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at december   with expiration dates through  the majority of which contain a one year renewal option 
the letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements
