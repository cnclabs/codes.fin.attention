item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the objective of this section is to help understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear under part ii  item of this annual report 
overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest and dividend income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
to a much lesser extent  we also recognize pre tax income from service charge income mostly from service charges on deposit accounts  from the increase in cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance and from the sale of securities and loans 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
expenses 
the expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and promotion expenses  professional fees  data processing expense  fdic insurance assessment  stationery and supplies expense  amortization of identifiable intangible assets and other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expenses consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance  retirement plans and other employee benefits 
it also includes expenses related to our employee stock ownership plan and restricted stock awards granted under our stock based incentive plan 
expense for the employee stock ownership plan is based on the average market value of the shares committed to be released 
an equal number of shares are released each year over terms of the two loans from new england bancshares that were used to fund the employee stock ownership plan s purchase of shares in the stock offering in both the mutual holding company reorganization and the second step conversion 
expense for shares of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant 
compensation and related expenses is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we began expensing stock options in fiscal and are included in salaries and employee benefits expenses and the consolidated statements of income 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of land  building and equipment  consist primarily of lease payments  real estate taxes  depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from ten to years for buildings and premises and three to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the lease 
advertising and promotion expenses include expenses for print advertisements  promotions and premium items 
professional fees primarily include fees paid to our independent auditors  our attorneys  our internal auditor and any consultants we employ  such as to review our loan or investment portfolios 
data processing expenses include fees paid to our third party data processing service and atm expense 

index fdic insurance assessment consists of deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdic 
stationery and supplies expense consists of expenses for office supplies 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets consists of the amortization  on a straight line basis over a ten year period  of the  core deposit intangible that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of windsor locks community bank  fsl in december and on a sum of years digits basis over a ten year period  of the million core deposit intangible that was incurred in conjunction with the company s acquisition of first valley bancorp  inc other expenses include charitable contributions  regulatory assessments  telephone  insurance and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill and other intangibles to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  the value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a monthly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based on an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  economic conditions and business conditions affecting our primary market area  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  the duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
further  the fdic and state of connecticut department of banking  as an integral part of their examination processes  review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
an increase to the allowance required to be made by an agency would negatively impact our earnings 
additionally  a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by asu goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded  and subsequent impairment analysis  requires us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue grown trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 

index operating strategy our mission is to operate and further expand a profitable community oriented financial institution 
we plan to achieve this by executing our strategy of pursuing opportunities to increase commercial real estate lending and commercial loans in our market area  continuing to emphasize the origination of one to four family residential real estate loans  expanding our delivery system through a combination of increased uses of technology and additional branch facilities  although we have not entered into any agreements regarding the establishment or acquisition of new branches  aggressively attracting core deposits  managing our net interest margin and net interest spread by having a greater percentage of our assets in loans  especially higher yielding loans  which generally have a higher yield than securities  and managing interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate or shorter duration loans 
pursue opportunities to increase commercial real estate lending in our market area commercial real estate loans provide us with the opportunity to earn more income because they tend to have higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans 
in addition  these loans are beneficial for interest rate risk management because they typically have shorter terms and adjustable interest rates 
commercial real estate loans increased million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  and at march  comprised approximately of total loans 
there are many commercial properties located in our market area  and we may pursue the larger lending relationships associated with these opportunities  while continuing to originate any such loans in accordance with what we believe are our conservative underwriting guidelines 
we have added expertise in our commercial loan department in recent years 
additionally  we may employ additional commercial lenders in the future to help increase our commercial lending 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
expand our delivery system through a combination of increased uses of technology and additional branch facilities we intend to expand the ways in which we reach and serve our customers 
we implemented internet banking in fiscal  which allows our customers to access their accounts and pay bills online 
in fiscal  we introduced an enhancement to our website to enable customers to obtain loan information to apply for a residential or commercial loan online 
additionally  in fiscal we introduced remote deposit capture  a product which 
index allows commercial customers to deposit checks from their office with the use of a scanner  thereby eliminating the need to physically visit an office to make a deposit 
also  we opened new branch offices in east windsor  connecticut in october  ellington  connecticut in april  our farmington avenue  bristol branch office in march and our southington branch office in january we intend to pursue expansion in our market area in the future  whether through de novo branching or acquisition 
however  we have not entered into any binding commitments regarding our expansion plans 
aggressively attract core deposits core deposits accounts other than certificates of deposit comprised of our total deposits at march  we value core deposits because they represent longer term customer relationships and a lower cost of funding compared to certificates of deposit 
we aggressively seek core deposits through competitive pricing and targeted advertising 
in addition  we offer business checking accounts for our commercial customers 
we also hope to increase core deposits by pursuing expansion inside and outside of our market area through de novo branching 
manage net interest margin and net interest spread by having a greater percentage of our assets in loans  especially higher yielding loans  which generally have a higher yield than securities we intend to continue to manage our net interest margin and net interest spread by seeking to increase lending levels and by originating higher yielding loans 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate and commercial business loans are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
consequently  multi family and commercial real estate and commercial business loans typically have higher yields  which increase our net interest margin and net interest spread 
in addition  we have started  and expect to continue  to sell one to four family mortgage loans in an effort to increase yields on the overall loan portfolio 
manage interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate and shorter duration loans we manage our interest rate sensitivity to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than longer term loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread  and decrease the maturities of our assets  in part by the origination of adjustable rate and shorter term loans 
to this end  we sell some of our long term fixed rate residential mortgage loans

provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the size of the provision for each year is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
we recorded provisions for loan losses of million and million in the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision was caused primarily by the million decrease in net charge offs  from million in fiscal year to  in fiscal year although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses  there can be no assurance that we will not have to change the provisions for loan losses in subsequent periods 
management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate

index risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is contractually due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we encounter are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations owed to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
we make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes days past due 
if payment is not received by the th day of delinquency  additional letters and phone calls generally are made 
typically  when the loan becomes days past due  we send a letter notifying the borrower that we may commence legal proceedings if the loan is not paid in full within days 
generally  loan workout arrangements are made with the borrower at this time  however  if an arrangement cannot be structured before the loan becomes days past due  we will send a formal demand letter and  once the time period specified in that letter expires  commence legal proceedings against any real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any business assets or personal property that secures the loan 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
management informs the boards of directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than days  and all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own on a quarterly basis 
analysis of non performing and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be non performing assets 
when a loan becomes days delinquent  the loan is placed on non accrual status at which time the accrual of interest ceases and an allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a non accrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or at fair value 
thereafter  we carry foreclosed real estate at fair value  net of estimated selling costs 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
non performing assets totaled million  or of total assets  at march   which was an increase of million from march  as a result  nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans increased from at march  to at march  at march  we had five residential properties and three commercial properties classified as other real estate owned totaling million

non performing loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans which have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the full collection of interest or principal 
other than as disclosed in the above table  there were no other loans at march  that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms 
interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended march  had non accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to  none of which was recognized in interest income 
banking regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the connecticut department of banking and fdic have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets that do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful  we establish a specific allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we charge off an amount equal to of the portion of the asset classified as loss 

index the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified and criticized assets at the dates indicated 
at march  in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified and criticized assets classified assets at march  included seventy two loans totaling million that were considered non performing 
classified assets at march  included fifty five loans totaling million that were considered non performing 
classified and special mention assets increased million to million at march   from million at march   and were and of total loans at march  and  respectively 
the increase was caused primarily by the downgrading of several large relationships as a result of declining economic performance impacting debt service covenants

analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
when a loan  or portion thereof  is considered uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance when collected 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
based on management s judgment  the allowance for loan losses covers all known losses and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances for identified problem loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowances for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on identified problem loans based on factors including  but not limited to the borrower s ability and willingness to repay the loan  the type  marketability  and value of the collateral  the strength of our collateral position  and the borrower s repayment history 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
we also establish a general allowance by applying loss factors to the remainder of the loan portfolio to capture the inherent losses associated with the lending activity 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning loss factors to each category 
the loss factors are determined based on our historical loss experience  delinquency trends 
index and management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
based on management s judgment  we may adjust the loss factors due to changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment 
the connecticut department of banking  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate 
they may require the bank to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
at march   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased million from march  to march  due to a provision for loan losses of million  partially offset by net charge offs of  the provision for loan losses for the year ended march  reflected the deterioration in the local economy as well as continued growth of the loan portfolio  particularly the increase in commercial real estate and commercial loans  which carry higher risks of default than one to four family residential real estate loans 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated 
at march  amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands mortgage loans residential loans commercial real estate home equity loans and lines of credit consumer loans commercial loans total allowance for loan losses although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

index analysis of loan loss experience 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
where specific loan loss allowances have been established  any difference between the loss allowance and the amount of loss realized has been charged or credited to current income 
at or for the fiscal year ended march  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs residential loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans and lines of credit consumer loans commercial loans total charge offs recoveries residential loans consumer loans commercial loans total recoveries net charge offs allowance obtained through merger balance at end of period ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans loans are presented before allowance for loan losses 
non performing loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans which we have identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest or principal 
during the fiscal year ended march   we acquired million of allowance for loan losses in connection with the acquisition of first valley bancorp 
the loans acquired in the merger were primarily commercial real estate loans  residential loans and commercial loans  which had a face value of million and a fair value of million 
in determining the fair value of the loans  we used a discounted cash flow method utilizing the current loan rate as of the date of the consummation of the merger 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses that was attributable to these loans was calculated based on the collectibility of the loans  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
during the fiscal year ended march  we acquired apple valley s million in net loans 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  the allowance for loan losses of apple valley was not consolidated into new england bank s allowance for loan losses 
instead  individual loan book values were reduced by the estimated credit loss associated with the allowance for loan losses 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in money market mutual funds  federal funds sold and short and intermediate term agency and municipal securities 

index our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at march  in addition  at march   we had the ability to borrow approximately million from the federal home loan bank of boston 
on that date  we had million outstanding 
at march   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  which included million in undisbursed construction loans and million in unused lines of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of march  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before march  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table presents our contractual obligations at march  payments due by period total one year or less more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total consists of federal home loan bank advances  subordinated debentures and excludes fair value adjustment 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts  federal home loan bank advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposits and commercial banking relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract certain deposit products 
the following table presents our primary investing and financing activities during the periods indicated 
years ended march  in thousands investing activities loan originations loan participations purchased securities purchased financing activities increase in deposits decrease increase in fhlb advances decrease increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase capital management 
the bank manages its capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and is subject to various regulatory capital requirements

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit

effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk management 
the bank manages the interest rate sensitivity of its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect their earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of their earnings  the bank has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
also  the bank attempts to manage its interest rate risk through its investment portfolio  an increased focus on commercial and multi family and commercial real estate lending  which emphasizes the origination of shorter term adjustable rate loans  and efforts to originate adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
in addition  the bank has commenced a program of selling long term  fixed rate one to four family residential loans in the secondary market 
the bank currently does not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
the bank has an asset liability committee  which includes members of both the board of directors and management  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
net interest income simulation analysis 
the bank analyzes its interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the bank s goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
interest income simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the asset liability committee 
the simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions 
the numerous assumptions used in the simulation processes are reviewed by the asset liability committee on a quarterly basis 
changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation 
the simulations incorporate assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain 
index assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates 
the simulation analyses incorporate management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors 
the simulation analyses are only an estimate of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
the bank s board of directors and management continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities
