the loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of and or a reduction in purchases of the company products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the company financial position and results of operations

the company business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first half of each year 
during past years  the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
in addition  during  the company experienced decreases in sales due  in part  to unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months  which adversely impacted demand for refrigerants 
delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods  lack of refrigerant demand  increased expenses  declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the company financial position and significant losses 
the company believes that there is a similar seasonal element to refrigerantside service revenues as refrigerant sales 
the company is continuing to assess its refrigerantside service revenues seasonal trend
