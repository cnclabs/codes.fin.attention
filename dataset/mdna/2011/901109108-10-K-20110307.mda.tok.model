item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through three basic segments or operations civil  building  and management services 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the western  northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialize d building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  transportation  healthcare  municipal offices  sports and entertainment  educational  correctional facilities  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets  and electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac services 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the us military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement  steel erection  electrical and mechanical  plumbing and hvac 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of o ur business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
generally  each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of billion  income from construction operations of million and net income of million 
we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to existing contracts  and ended the year with a contract backlog of billion 
at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to 
our stockholders equity increased to billion as of december   reflecting the operating results achieved in  despite difficult economic conditions particularly in the construction industry 
recent developments acquisition of fisk electric on january   we completed the acquisition of fisk electric company fisk  a privately held electrical construction company based in houston  texas 
under the terms of the transaction  we acquired of fisk stock for million in cash  subject to a post closing adjustment based on the net worth of fisk at closing  plus an amount to be determined based upon fisk operating results for through the transaction was financed using proceeds from the offering of senior unsecured notes which was completed in october see senior notes offering section below 
based in houston  texas  fisk covers many of the major commercial and industrial electrical construction markets in southwest and southeast locations with abilities to cover other attractive markets nationwide 
fisk expertise in the design development of electrical and technology systems for major projects spans a broad variety of project types including commercial office buildings  sports arenas  hospitals  research laboratories  hospitality and casinos  convention centers  and industrial facilities 
fisk was acquired because we believe that fisk is a strong strategic fit enabling us to expand our nationwide electrical construction capabilities and to realize significant synergies and opportunities in support of our non residential building and civil operations 

index acquisition of superior gunite on november   we completed the acquisition of superior gunite  a california based privately held construction company specializing in pneumatically placed structural concrete and certain related companies collectively  superior 
under the terms of the transaction  we acquired of the stock of superior for a purchase price of million in cash  including a post closing adjustment based on the net worth of superior at closing  plus additional consideration in the form of an earn out based on superior s fiscal through operating results 
superior was acquired because we believe it is a strong strategic fit  enabling us to achieve greater vertical integration by increasing the percentage of work we self perform in our building and civil operations 
senior notes offering on october   we completed a private placement offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the notes  due november  to several initial purchasers 
the notes were priced at of par  resulting in a yield to maturity of 
the notes were made available in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and are guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors 
the initial purchasers subsequently sold the notes to qualified institutional buyers and to persons outside of the united states  as defined under the securities act 
the private placement of the notes resulted in net proceeds of approximately million to the company after deducting debt disco unt of million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions such as fisk electric and superior gunite noted above  and stock repurchases 
additionally  on october  in connection with the private placement of the notes  the company  our subsidiaries and the initial purchasers of the notes entered into a registration rights agreement that requires the company and our subsidiaries  among other things  to use their commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with the sec and to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the sec within days of the issue date of the notes with respect to an offer to exchange the notes for a new issue of debt securities  with substantially identical terms registered under the securities act 
for further information on the notes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amended credit facility on october   an amendment to the third amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement became effective that provided for  among other things  i the permitted incurrence of the additional indebtedness under the issuance of the notes  as described above  ii modifications to certain covenants to permit our consummation of the issuance of the notes  and iii certain other modifications to our financial covenants and certain other covenants 
mgm citycenter matter in public statements  mgm asserted its intent to enter into settlement discussions directly with subcontractors under contract with us 
as of december  mgm has reached agreements with subcontractors to settle at a discount approximately million of amounts billed to mgm 
we have reduced amounts included in revenues  cost of construction operations  accounts receivable and accounts payable for the reduction in subcontractor pass through billings 
at december  we had approximately million recorded as contract receivables for amounts due and owed to us and our subcontractors 
included in our receivables are pass through subcontractor billings for contract work and retention  and other requests for equitable adjustment for additional work in the amount of m illion 
as subcontractor pass through billings are settled  we will reduce our mechanic s lien as appropriate 
in the event mgm reaches additional settlements with subcontractors for amounts less than currently due and we agree to the settlement  we will reduce amounts included in revenues  cost of construction operations  accounts receivable and accounts payable for the reduction in subcontractor pass through billings  which we would not expect to have an impact on recorded profit 
declaration and payment of special dividend on october   the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share of common stock payable to shareholders of record on november  the special dividend was paid on november 
index common stock repurchase program on march   our board of directors extended the common stock repurchase program put into place on november  the program allows us to repurchase up to million of our common stock through march  under the terms of the program  we may repurchase shares in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of any repurchase will be based on our evaluation of market conditions  business considerations and other factors 
we expect to use cash on hand to fund repurchases of our common stock 
stock repurchases will be conducted in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
repurchases also may be made under rule b plans  which would permit common stock to be purchased when we woul d otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws 
the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock  and the program may be extended  modified  suspended or discontinued at any time  at our discretion 
during  we repurchased  shares under the program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
there were no repurchases made during during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million under the program 
backlog analysis for our backlog of uncompleted construction work at december  was approximately billion  as compared to the billion at december  building segment backlog decreased during the year as a result of the substantial completion of large hospitality and gaming projects in las vegas  nevada  and the lack of new work acquired in the non residential building markets 
civil segment backlog increased as anticipated due to the award of new projects in california  metropolitan new york and washington state 
the company expects to continue to replace a portion of its high contract volume building projects with a growing share of higher margin new civil projects 
the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at december  new business awarded revenue recognized in backlog at december  in millions building civil management services total new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation o f our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that the method of accounting for contracts  is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 

index our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow us to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues may take years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become kno wn  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our balance sheet as part of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings relating to unapproved change orders and claims included in our balance sheet at december  and is summarized below december  in thousands unapproved change orders claims of the balance of unapproved change orders and claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings at december  and december   approximately million and million respectively  are amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings as described in item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
these amounts are management s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to red uce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against earnings in the relevant future period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period in which such amounts are resolved 

index billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over contract billings to date 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily trade names and contractor license  for impairment by applying a fair value test in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets should be evaluated 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during  we completed a reorganization enabling us to realize greater operating efficiencies and take full advantage of the civil construction expertise acquired through the merger with tutor saliba 
as a result of the reorganization  the composition and number of reporting units has changed 
we reallocated goodwill between its reorganized reporting units based on the relative fair value of pre reorganization reporting unit components distributed to post reorganization reporting units 
the number of reportable segments has not changed see note entitled business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we acquired superior gunite  which is included in our civil reportable segment 
when testing goodwill  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill  if any  over the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  we primarily use the income approach which is based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future 
this income valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to b e used as a discount rate 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
we also use the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples of operating earnings 
when calculating impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives  we compare the fair value of these assets  as determined based on the income and market valuation methods  to the carrying value 
the impairment charge equals the excess of the carrying value of the asset  if any  over its fair value 
an implied control premium for the company is calculated based on the fair value and the market capitalization at the date of our fair value assessment 
in evaluating whether our implied control premium is reasonable  we consider a number of factors including the following factors of greatest significance 
market control premium we compare our implied control premium to the average control premium paid in transactions of companies in the construction industry during the year of evaluation 
sensitivity analysis we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the minimum control premium required to recover the book value of the company at the testing date 
the minimum control premium required is then compared to the average control premium paid in transactions of companies in the construction industry during the year of evaluation 

index impact of low public float and limited trading activity a significant portion of our common stock is owned by our chairman and ceo 
as a result  the public float of our common stock  calculated as the percentage of shares of common stock freely traded by public investors divided by our total shares outstanding  is significantly lower than that of our publicly traded peers 
this circumstance does not impact the fair value of the company  however based on our evaluation of third party market data  we believe it does lead to an inherent marketability discount impacting our stock price 
on a quarterly basis we consider whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets  including goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization might be impaired 
in conjunction with this analysis  we evaluate whether our current market capitalization is less than our stockholders equity and specifically consider the duration and severity of any decline in market capitalization  a reconciliation of the implied control premium to a current market control premium  target price assessments by third party analysts and how current market conditions impact our forecast of future cash flows 
we also update our assessment of the fair value of each of our reporting units  considering whether our current forecast of future cash flows are in line with those used in our most recen t annual impairment assessment and whether there are any significant changes in trends or any other material assumption used 
as of december  we have concluded that we do not have an impairment indicator and that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded in or in the fourth quarter of  we performed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
there was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of this evaluation 
as of the date of the most recent annual impairment analysis  the fair value of the company substantially exceeded the carrying value of billion and the market capitalization of million 
the implied control premium was within the range of market control premiums paid in transactions of companies in the construction industry during fair value measurements we determined that we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  valued at million as of december  all of these instruments are classified as available for sale securities as of december  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
in addition  we obtained an independent valuation of some of our auction rate security instruments and considered these valuations in determining the estimated fair values of the auction rate securities in our portfolio 
our analyses considered  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security i nvestments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value 
in conjunction with our estimates of fair value at december   we determined that certain of our investments in auction rate securities were impaired and  accordingly  we recognized a million impairment charge 
this impairment charge was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation we have granted restricted stock units and stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which corresponds to the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option awards and the expected volatility of our stock price over the life of the awards 
we used the black scholes merton option pricing model to value our sto ck option awards  and utilized the historical volatility of our common stock as a reasonable estimate of the future volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change which require the use of different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded through december  
index insurance liabilities we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverage 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of our insurance liability within our self insured deductible limits includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact our consolidated fi nancial position and results of operations 
we purchase varying levels of insurance from third parties  including excess liability insurance  to cover losses in excess of our self insured deductible limits 
currently  our self insured deductible limit for workers compensation  general liability and automobile coverage is generally million per occurrence 
in addition  on certain projects  we assume the risk for the amount of the self insured deductible portion of losses that arise from any subcontractor defaults 
our self insured deductible limit for subcontractor default on projects covered under our program is million per occurrence  subject to a million annual aggregate 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
we identified and reviewed potential tax uncertainties for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and determined that the exposure to those uncertainties did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as of december  defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
we plan t o change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon a similar analysis by our actuaries 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity and fixed income 
we plan to continue to use a return on asset rate of in based on projected equity and bond market performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and by million  million and million  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded adjustments to our pension liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the vested benefit was preserved 
due to the expected increase in amortization of prior years investment losses  we anticipate that pension expense will increase from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be approximately million in cash contributions may vary significantly in the future depending upon asset performance and the interest rate environment

index revenues from construction operations the following table summarizes our revenue by segment 
revenues for the year ended december  dollars in millions change change building civil management services total overall revenues decreased by  million or  from  million in to  million in this decrease was due primarily to a  million decrease in our building segment revenues  from  million in to  million in  resulting from the substantial completion of the citycenter project in december  which contributed approximately billion of revenues to the building segment during  as well as other declines in revenues in the hospitality and gaming and private nonresidential building markets due to continued financing and economic challenges arising from the current state of the global economy 
civil segment revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to an increased number of projects und er construction in the metropolitan new york area which were awarded during management services segment revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the completion of several overhead coverage system projects in iraq and an airport facility in guam

building segment income from construction operations decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the substantial completion in of several large projects in the hospitality and gaming and private nonresidential building markets  including the citycenter project 
however  our building segment achieved an increase in operating margin due to a higher mix of public works projects in and by increasing the amount of our self performed work 
civil segment income from construction operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in revenues discussed above coupled with favorable performance on certain large projects 
management services income from construction operations decreased by million or  from million to million in  reflecting the favorable performance achieved in upon substantial completion of several overhead coverage system projects in iraq and an airport facility in guam 
overall income from construction operations was favorably impacted by an million or decrease in corporate g a expense  from million in to million in  due to savings related to cost reduction measures instituted during 
index other income expense  interest expense and provision for income taxes year ended december  dollars in millions change change other income expense  net interest expense provision for income taxes other income expense  net decreased by million or  from income of million in to expense of million in  due primarily to the recognition of million impairment charge relating to the adjustment of our investments in auction rate securities to fair value  and an increase in amortization of deferred debt costs due to the amendments to our credit agreement in and the issuance of our million senior unsecured notes in october the impact of these increased charges was partly offset by a net reduction in certain business acquisition related liabilities 
interest expense increased by million or  from million in to million in  primarily due to the interest expense recorded in associated with our million senior unsecured notes  partly offset by a non recurring interest charge recorded in and a reduction in interest expense due to not borrowing under our credit facility during  as compared to the provision for income taxes decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the decrease in pretax income in  as compared to  partly offset by a higher effective tax rate

revenues for the year ended december  dollars in millions change change building civil management services total overall revenues decreased by million or  from  million in to  million in revenue increases in both the civil and management services segments were offset by a decrease in building construction revenues of million or 
the decrease in building construction revenues is due to the completion of several large building projects in such as citycenter  and was partially offset by the addition of million in revenues from a full year of projects acquired in the merger with tutor saliba and the acquisition of keating 
civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the acquisition of new work during  such as the i bridge replacement in shasta county  california and the caldecott tunnel project near oakland  california 
management services revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in due to an increase in volume from new work

the following discussion of income from construction operations has been prepared on a pre impairment charge basis in order to enable users of this information to better compare normal operating results of each segment between the two periods 
since the impairment charge impacts only and does not affect revenues  cost of revenues or general expenses we incur to conduct our day to day construction operations  management believes the following discussion  analysis and comparison of and operating results is more meaningful to users when prepared on a pre impairment charge basis 
building construction income from operations before the impairment charge remained fairly consistent  increasing by million or  from million in to million in building construction income from operations  net of the impairment charge recorded in  decreased slightly due to a decrease in revenues discussed above  and was favorably impacted in by a higher margin on certain large public works projects 
civil construction income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million  or  from million in to million in our civil operations have been favorably impacted by a full year of tutor saliba operations and by an increase in mass transit projects acquired during in conjunction with the increase in revenues discussed ab ove  management services contributed to our income from operations in management services income from operations before the impairment charge increased by million or  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting an increase in volume of work in guam due to a full year of tutor saliba operations in 
index overall income from construction operations was unfavorably impacted by a million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a full year of tutor saliba general and administrative expenses  one time charges related to the acquisition of keating  and the integration of tutor saliba  net of other cost reduction activities in corporate services 
other income  interest expense and provision for income taxes year ended december  dollars in millions change change other income  net interest expense provision for income taxes other income decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to less interest income  which decreased by million as a result of lower average interest rates and a lower average investment balance during interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to a temporary increase in borrowing under our revolving credit facility during and an increase in transportation equipment financing 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate for was as compared to in the decrease in the tax rate is a result of a favorable variance in permanent tax liability differences from current and prior years 
in  the effective tax rate of was applied to pretax income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge of million which is not tax deductible 
potential impact of current economic conditions current economic and financial market conditions in the united states and overseas  including severe disruptions in the credit markets  have had an adverse affect on our results of operations 
if there is a prolonged economic recession or depression or if government efforts to stabilize and revitalize credit markets and financial institutions are not effective  current economic and financial market conditions could continue to adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
the current instability in the financial markets has made it difficult for certain of our customers  including state and local governments  to access the credit markets to obtain financing or refinancing  as the case may be  to fund new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
state and local governments also are facing significant budget shortfalls as a result of declining tax and other revenues  which may cause them to defer or cancel planned infrastructure projects 
this situation has contributed to lower revenues in and we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
such deferrals  delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital on october   we completed a private placement offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the notes  due november  to several initial purchasers 
the notes were priced at of par  resulting in a yield to maturity of 
the private placement of the notes resulted in net proceeds of approximately million to the company after deducting debt discount of million 
the notes mature on november   and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in cash in arrears on may  and november of each year  beginning on may  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under our amended credit agreement

index on september   we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  as agent  which was amended by a joinder agreement dated february   by a first amendment dated as of february   by a second amendment dated january   and by a third amendment dated october  collectively the amended credit agreement 
for a description of the material terms of the amended credit agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amended credit agreement allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving credit basis the revolving facility  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  and an additional million at december  under a supplementary faci lity to the extent that the million revolving facility has been fully drawn the supplemental facility 
the amended credit agreement provides that the supplemental facility shall be reduced by the amount of any reduction in the principal amount of certain auction rate securities presently held by us 
this supplemental facility provides us with access to a source of liquidity should the need arise 
subject to certain conditions  we have the option to increase the revolving facility by up to an additional million 
we borrowed under the revolving facilities during a brief period in and did not utilize the revolving facility during either or  other than for letters of credit 
there are no borrowings outstanding at december  and  accordingly we have million available to borrow under the amended credit agreement and the supplemental facility  including outstanding letters of credit 
cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes  while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
joint venture cash and cash equivalents are not restricted to specific uses within those entities  however  the terms of the joint venture agreements limit our ability to distribute those funds and use them for corporate purposes 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with our respective percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and december   cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was and million  respectively  and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively 
billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors after we receive payment from our customer 
a summary of cash flows for each of the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  in millions cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year 
index during  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in operating cash flow from our civil segment which more than offset a decrease in operating cash flow from our building segment resulting from the timing of receivable collections on certain large projects  including receivables on the citycenter project 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  including million to fund the acquisition of superior gunite  million to fund the deferred purchase price of certain acquisitions made in prior years  million to purchase construction equipment  and million for restricted cash to secure insurance related contingent obligations  such as insurance claim deductibles  in lieu of utilizing letters of credit 
we received million from financing activities which primarily reflects proceeds of million received in conjunction with our issuance of the notes  net of the debt discount 
cash flow used for financing activities also includes million for the payment of a special dividend on our common stock  million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in accordance with our previously announced share repurchase program  a net reduction in debt of million  and million for costs primarily associated with our issuance of the notes 
during  we used million in cash flow from operating activities 
the negative cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the timing of receivables on certain large projects 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  principally the purchase of property used in our building and management services segments  equipment to be used in our civil segment  and million to fund the acquisition of keating 
we received million in cash from financing activities  principally from a million note collateralized by transportation equipment owned by us and two notes totaling million to finance property acquisitions in guam 
our cash balance decreased by million during due to the use of cash in our operating and investing activities  which was primarily driven by an uncollected contract receivable related to the fontainebleau project  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and timing related billings due to the start up of new projects and the cash disbursements associated with projects completing during the year 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
the positive cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues as well as favorable operating results in our civil and management services segments 
we used million in cash to fund investing activities  principally the purchase of auction rate securities  transportation and construction equipment to be used primarily in our civil construction operations  net of a million cash balance recorded in connection with the merger with tutor saliba because the consideration paid in the merger was equity and not cash 
we used million in cash to fund financing activities  principally million for the repayment of shareholder notes payable assumed i n the merger with tutor saliba  million for the repayment of debt  and million for the purchase of common stock in connection with our common stock repurchase program which was instituted in november the debt repayments include million of debt assumed in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba 
due to the use of cash for investing and financing activities  our cash balance decreased by million during working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  the increase in working capital over the two year period primarily reflects the cash proceeds received from the issuance of the notes 
accordingly  the current ratio increased from x at december  to x at december  long term investments at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million  which are reflected at fair value 
these investments are considered to be available for sale  and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our available credit facilities  and the million in proceeds received from our offering of senior unsecured notes complete d in october  we do not expect the short term lack of liquidity to affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan 
for a description of our accounting for auction rate securities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities  the majority of which are rated aaa or aa  that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days 
in the event that such auctions are unsuccessful  the holder of the securities is not able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
an unsuccessful auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
during the first quarter of  we made substantial additional investments in auction rate securities 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
since that time  we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities 
during  we determined that an impairment charge was appropriate and  accordingly  we recognized a million impairment charge  which was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
during  we determined that the carrying value of our auction rate securities reflected fair value and therefore did not recognize any impairment charge 
during  we det ermined that an impairment charge was appropriate and  accordingly  we recognized a million impairment charge in of the total million impairment charge recorded  million was deemed to be other than temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to income 
the million balance of the impairment charge was deemed to be temporary  thereby resulting in a charge to stockholders equity 

index off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
long term debt long term debt  excluding current maturities of million  was million at december   an increase of million from december   due primarily to the issuance of the notes 
the remaining balance of our outstanding debt is generally secured by the underlying assets 
approximately million of the million in total debt outstanding at december  carries interest at a fixed rate 
as a result of the issuance of the notes due in  the long term debt to equity ratio increased to 
x at december   as compared to 
x at december  contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years total debt  excluding interest interest payments on debt operating leases  net purchase obligations acquisition related liabilities unfunded pension liability total contractual obligations stockholders equity our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the major factors impacting stockholders equity during the three year period were the million shares issued in conjunction with the merger with tutor saliba in  the net income loss recorded in all three years  the annual amortization of restricted stock compensation expense  common stock options exercised  the excess income tax benefit attributable to stock based compensation  the repurchase of our common stock in and in conjunction with our share repurchase program  and the declaration of a special dividend on our common stock in also  we were required to adjust our accrued pension liability by an increase of million in  a decrease of million in  and an increase of million in  respectively  and a cumulative increase of million in prior years  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss which resulted in an aggregate million pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss reduction in stockholders equity at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to the amount of this accrued pension liability will be recorded in future years based upon periodic re evaluation of the funded status of our pension plans 

index dividends on october   our board of directors declared a special dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on november  to stockholders of record on november  there were no other cash dividends declared or paid on our outstanding common stock during the three years ended december  related party transactions we are subject to certain related party transactions with our chairman and chief executive officer  ronald n 
tutor  and the vice chairman of o g industries  inc  one of our directors 
for a more detailed description of these transactions and their effect on our financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled related party transactions in part iv  item of this report 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a staff position amending existing guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements 
this update requires new disclosures on significant transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level of the fair value hierarchy including the reasons for these transfers and the reasons for any transfers in or out of level it also requires a reconciliation of recurring level measurements and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements for reporting fair value disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities rather than each major category of assets and liabilities 
this update was effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period begin ning january   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will become effective for us with the interim and annual reporting period beginning january  we will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes 
other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this update has not and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement and our short term and long term investment portfolios 
our revolving credit agreement is available for us to borrow  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
we did not borrow under our revolving credit facilities during our outstanding debt at december  totaled million  of which approximately million carries interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  we do not believe our liquidity or our operations are su bject to significant market risk for changes in interest rates 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities  the majority of which are rated aaa or aa  that generally represent interests in pools of either interest bearing student loans or municipal bond issues 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every or days

upon an unsuccessful auction  the interest rat es do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based upon a formula contained in the security  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
since mid february  regularly scheduled auctions for these securities started to fail throughout the market at a significant rate 
since that time  we have been successful in liquidating at par value a significant portion of our investment in auction rate securities 
at december   we had investments in auction rate securities of million which are reflected at fair value after cumulative net fair value adjustments of million 
these investments are considered to be available for sale and are classified as long term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines 
the current overall liquidity concerns in capital markets have affected our ability to liquidate many of our investments in auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash equivalent investments  our available revolving facility and our supplemental facility discussed above  and the million in net proceeds received from our issuance of the notes in october  we do not expect that the short term lack of liquidity of our auction rate security investments will materially affect our overall liquidity position or our ability to execute our current business plan
