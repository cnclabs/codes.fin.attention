item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
executive overview the company is in its fourth year of operations following the merger of equals of fnb and lsb in july and the subsequent merger of the two billion legacy banks  fnb southeast and lsb bank  in late due primarily to the severe economic recession that followed  the company lost million not including goodwill impairment in and million in the company did not defer credit costs  but instead aggressively charged off and wrote down credits in an effort to rapidly restore profitability 
in  earnings dramatically improved by million 
today  we believe the company is well positioned to take advantage of a disrupted market 
in july  pressley a 
ridgill was named ceo of the company  having become president of the company  and ceo and president of the bank in one year earlier  mr 
ridgill had been appointed ceo of fnb and fnb southeast 
through the combination  the bank became the largest community bank in the north central region of north carolina  known as the piedmont triad 
while a number of challenges emerged during the recession  the newly appointed ceo began bringing together his executive management team 
the management team members were selected for their talents  experience and commitment to the company s guiding principles  which are founded on the concept that financial success begins with integrity 
by early  the executive management team was in place  and the credit deterioration in the loan portfolio had peaked 
having implemented a re defined community bank strategy  the company focused on returning to profitability 
under mr 
ridgill s guidance  management s implementation of the redefined community bank strategy has yielded dramatically improved operating results and positive trends  including five consecutive quarters of profit  including million of full year profit in pre tax income increased million from to net interest margin of in  an basis point improvement over the prior year core deposit growth of in provision for credit losses declined million from to nonperforming loans declined from the june peak  excluding changes in troubled debt restructured loans total noninterest expense declined by million in and million in  recurring operating expense declined by million in and million in compared to the prior years total and tier one leverage capital improved to and  respectively  at december  from their lows of and  respectively as we evaluate our results  we are satisfied with robust improvements in lowering operating and credit related costs  increasing net interest income and building a stable capital position well above the regulatory levels required to be well capitalized 
from through the company charged off more than million of loans and other real estate owned  or of the highest peak level of loan balances of june as we have previously discussed  our desire was to put this adverse credit cycle behind us as quickly as possible  through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful in doing so 
looking forward to  we believe credit costs will remain high for many months to come  but core earnings should continue to exceed credit costs and preferred dividends  resulting in a rising level of capital generation 
in the recovery period of this recession  we believe the company has emerged more disciplined and efficient with a greater opportunity for long term success than what would have otherwise been realized 

table of contents our community bank strategy and operating plan as a community bank  we believe our opportunity to achieve exceptional returns for our shareholders is through consistent delivery of superior customer service to small and mid size business and consumer customers in a manner that the large national and super regional banks are unable or unwilling to emulate 
the piedmont triad has approximately billion of deposits and just of those balances are held at our bank 
the market is dominated by large national and regional banks  with of the market s deposits residing in banks with more than billion of assets 
consequently  even relatively small growth in our market share could potentially result in extraordinary gains for the company 
we believe the economic downturn affected many of the competing north carolina banks later in the credit cycle  which is resulting in less effective competition for quality customers  enhancing our opportunity to grow our market share 
to ensure the achievement of our strategic plan  management rewrote our operating plans following the bank merger to include basic measurable items that communicate throughout the organization the steps needed to improve the financial results of the organization 
the operating plan objectives include manage the net interest margin nim  including growing and expanding profitable customer relationships improve asset quality increase non interest income implement a disciplined cost management culture position the company to fulfill its vision and mission 
manage net interest margin net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and is the bank s primary source of revenue 
in order to manage our net interest income effectively  management must manage our net interest margin  which is the net yield on earning assets less the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in the strategic and operating plans  management defined several steps to improve our control of the net interest margin  including identifying and growing profitable relationships  by focusing our efforts and incentives on growing these relationships 
our performance based sales culture identifies specific methodologies and tools to use in cross selling to existing clients and introducing the bank to new prospects 
the bank looks to take advantage of the current turbulent financial environment to grow market share throughout our markets 
enhancing our interest rate risk management tools 
early in  management engaged a prominent consulting firm to improve management s interest rate risk management tools and practices 
this firm works with more than banks across the country and has been a leader in the asset liability management field since the s 
reducing the company s dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
pricing loans consistently while considering relationship pricing for deposit and other relationships 
management is also seeking to develop more consistency on loan pricing relative to the various durations of fixed rate loans 
implementing a more disciplined and accountable budget process to include monitoring loan  investment and deposit yields  rates and balances so that variances are questioned and controllable items are controlled 
management implemented many of these operating changes over the last three years  which had a pronounced impact on the company s operating results in and net interest income increased million in to million compared to million in the increased net interest income was due primarily to a basis point rise in the company s net interest margin to 
table of contents for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period a year ago 
the margin improved due to growth in core deposits and lower dependence on high cost time deposits 
the weighted average deposit costs fell basis points to for the year ending december  compared to for the year ending december  in  the company faced irrational time deposit pricing pressure from financial institutions in market 
the impact caused intense margin compression during late and the first two quarters of as management shifted liability strategies  high cost time deposits left the bank for higher rates elsewhere and were replaced with lower cost core deposit accounts 
now checking accounts became the featured product in marketing ads and internal sales incentives  which resulted in a sizable shift in the deposit mix 
at december   dda  money market  now and savings accounts totaled  or million  of the company s billion of deposits 
the percentage of core deposits has increased significantly  from  or million  at december  and  or million at december  improve asset quality our primary objective is to put the adverse affects of the recession behind us as quickly as possible through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful in identifying and taking appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits 
since  the company has charged off more than million of problem loans and other real estate owned 
asset quality has steadily improved since nonperforming loans peaked in june of at million 
at december   nonperforming loans totaled million  or of total loans  and nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets 
the company s highest risk and most closely monitored nonperforming assets are nonaccruing loans excluding troubled debt restructured loans 
these loans totaled million at december   down million  or since december  and down million  or  since june  oreo balances continue to cycle through the balance sheet  helping control the level of nonperforming assets over time 
at december   oreo balances totaled million  down from million at december  during  million of loans were transferred into oreo  million of oreo was written down  and million was sold 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  or of loans held for investment and of nonperforming loans 
provision for credit losses declined million for the year to million compared to million for the year ending december  the company s coverage percentage may not be comparable with other banking institutions due to its practice of charging off specific estimated losses on loans at the time they become measurable 
consequently  the company s allowance for credit losses consists primarily of general reserves  with being general and specific 
substantially all estimated losses from the company s million of non performing loans have been recognized through charge offs 
increase non interest income non interest income increased  in to million compared to million for gain on sale of investments boosted non interest income by million compared to the prior year 
excluding the gain on sale of investments  non interest income declined due primarily to lower deposit fee income resulting from changes in banking regulation combined with industry wide trends in consumer behavior that we believe are favorable to consumers as the banking industry implements improved consumer protection processes and policies on consumer overdraft activates 
the company also took steps to expand mortgage banking fees in through the acquisition of bradford mortgage  a quality community mortgage origination company operating principally in the piedmont triad area 
mortgage revenue totaled million in compared to  in investment services income also contributed strong growth  increasing  to million for the year 
with our sights set on continued growth in fee income businesses outside of retail banking  we believe non interest income sources will remain a favorable contributor to our future earnings 

table of contents implement a disciplined cost management culture core to the execution of management s operating plan is the implementation of a disciplined cost management culture where that which is within our control is controlled 
while certain items such as fdic insurance costs have proven to be outside our control  the vast majority of non interest related expenses are controllable 
a key element to changing the culture was the implementation of a line item accountable budget process 
the budget was built around a philosophy we termed as the cast philosophy  which is an acronym for conservative in forecasts and expectations accountable on an account by account basis specific to each individual in the organization so goals and budgets are understood timely so that continued monitoring and adjustments can be made since the merger  the bank has implemented several major cost reduction initiatives focused on eliminating excess costs and non core or unprofitable activities 
these initiatives include an ongoing franchise validation plan  which carefully reviews each of our branch locations and targets the elimination of waste  inefficiency and duplication throughout our franchise 
management developed a methodology that evaluates each location s pre tax contribution  age and state of the facility  ease of closure  market demographics and overall fit within our strategic vision 
execution of the franchise validation plan and other expense reduction initiatives has resulted in a net reduction of bank locations and full time equivalent employees since merger 
in and  the validation planning led to the closing of seven low performing locations  the addition of two locations and the planned sale of the last remaining virginia location 
following the sale  the company will have full service bank locations and full time equivalent employees 
the reduction in the number of branch locations and other expense reductions resulted in an improvement in our core efficiency from a high of to an average of in for the second consecutive year  the company has experienced meaningful gains by lowering operating costs 
in  recurring operating expenses declined million excluding million in one time items such as losses on disposal of branch locations 
in  recurring operating expenses fell an additional million 
the improved efficiency is due in large part to management s ability to focus attention on eliminating excess costs and inefficient products  services and delivery channels from legacy operations 
as we look into  we anticipate that the improved cost management culture will continue to improve the organization s financial performance 
while noninterest expense has declined significantly in recent years  the goal remains to continue to improve efficiencies to a level that surpasses our peers 
that objective has not yet been achieved  but remains a focus through continued discipline in a time that has the potential to generate meaningful growth in our company 
position the company to fulfill its vision and mission the company is located primarily in the piedmont triad area which is the third largest metropolitan area in north carolina 
the company is headquartered in proximity to the largest two markets in north carolina  charlotte and raleigh durham  both within a minute drive 
due to the weakened financial conditions among many north carolina financial institutions  consolidation of institutions is beginning to occur 
while the company may consider an in market acquisition of a troubled institution  it is more certain the company will look to acquire valuable customer relationships  which is likely to occur through the addition of key bankers 
the opportunity for growth is significant 
the company is carefully considering the growth and design of our franchise 
late in  the company decided to sell the last remaining virginia banking location  further clarifying the strategic plan as a north carolina bank 
consequently  growth will focus on expansion in the existing and adjacent market locations 
finally capital planning has remained paramount in this environment 
despite several challenging years following the merger  the company s capital levels remain well above the well capitalized levels as defined by regulatory guidelines 
at december  the company s total risk based capital was compared to the minimum well capitalized level of 
the company continues to have no near term plans to raise capital for the purpose of repaying tarp funds  however  the small business lending fund capital program may be a viable alternative to replacing tarp funds 
the company is very attentive to the ramifications of near 
table of contents and long term dilution caused by a capital raise 
therefore  while many opportunities seem to be emerging and will be evaluated  the decision to acquire another in market institution will be evaluated with a high regard to risk and dilution 
organic growth and talent acquisition may prove to be the more prudent growth strategy over time 
the company anticipates modest loan growth in financial condition at december  and bancorp s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect a decrease of from year end  following a decrease of during the previous year 
the decreases in both years are primarily a result of a decline in bancorp s loan portfolio 
total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets decreased  from billion in  to billion in the decreases in total average assets and average earning assets were also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding 
gross loans including loans held for sale decreased million during  or  compared to a decrease of in the decrease in loans is due primarily to principal repayment on existing loans  loan chargeoffs  and foreclosures  coupled with soft loan demand from qualified borrowers 
loans secured by real estate totaled billion in and represented of total loans excluding loans held for sale  compared with at year end within this category  residential real estate loans decreased to million and construction loans decreased to million 
commercial loans totaled million at year end  a decrease of from the end of consumer loans decreased during  ending the year at million 
management believes the bank is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers concentrated in a particular industry  the loss of whose deposits or whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations 
investment securities at amortized cost totaled million at year end  a increase from million at year end us government agency securities totaled million  or of the portfolio at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio one year earlier 
management believes that the additional risk of owning agency securities over us treasury securities is negligible and has capitalized on the favorable spreads available on the former 
mortgage backed securities totaled million  or of the portfolio  at december   compared to million  or of the portfolio at the previous year end 
state and municipal obligations amounted to million at year end  and comprised of the portfolio  compared to million  or of the portfolio a year earlier 
investment securities with a book value of million were sold during to reposition the investment portfolio and reduce the company s exposure to municipalities 
a portion of the securities that were identified for sale had been classified as held to maturity and  accordingly  all held to maturity securities were designated as available for sale 
during  the company began investing in corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
corporate bonds totaled million  or of the portfolio at december   of which million were covered bonds  compared to total corporate bonds of million  or of the portfolio at december   of which million were covered bonds 
cmos totaled million  or of the portfolio at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio at the end of the previous year 
the company s investment strategy is to achieve acceptable total returns through investments in securities with varying maturity dates  cash flows and yield characteristics 
us government agency securities are generally purchased for liquidity and collateral purposes  mortgage backed securities are purchased for yield and cash flow purposes  corporate bonds are purchased for yield and longer maturity municipal bonds are purchased for yield and income tax advantage 
the table  investment securities  on page  presents the composition of the securities portfolio for the last three years  as well as information about cost  fair value and weighted average yield 
the competition for deposits within the bank s market areas increased significantly during the liquidity crisis of as larger national and regional banks increased their rates in an effort to attract deposits and maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank  which historically has relied on appropriate pricing and high quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base  was forced to compete with higher rates offered by the larger national and regional banks in order to satisfy its deposit requirements 
during and throughout  the 
table of contents company shifted its liability strategy  reducing its dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
total deposits decreased million to billion at december   a decrease from a total of billion one year earlier 
this change was primarily the result of a million reduction in time deposits  as the interest rates offered by the bank declined substantially during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in now account deposits  as the bank s new fastforward checking product  introduced in the third quarter of  grew to million at december  in order to attract additional deposits when necessary  the bank uses several different sources such as membership in an electronic deposit gathering network that allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits from across the us bulletin board deposits  brokered certificates of deposit secured through broker dealer partnerships and deposits obtained through the promontory interfinancial network  also known as cdars 
the bank s reliance on these out of market deposits has continued to decrease during cdars decreased million  from million at year end to million at year end  while brokered deposits increased million  from million at year end to million at year end the bank also has a credit facility available with the fhlb of atlanta 
the bank utilized a portion of the approximately million credit line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end in addition to the credit line at the fhlb  the bank has borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank totaling million  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  management believes these credit lines are a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since particular amounts  terms and structures may be selected to meet changing needs 
financial condition at december  and bancorp s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect a decrease of over year end the decrease from year end to year end is primarily a result of the decline in bancorp s loan portfolio 
total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets increased  from billion in  to billion in the decrease in total average assets was also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding  while the slight increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in interest bearing bank balances 
gross loans decreased million during  or  compared to increases of in and in the decrease in loans was due primarily to principal repayment on existing loans  loan chargeoffs  and foreclosures  coupled with soft loan demand from qualified borrowers

table of contents partially offset by increases in now and money market deposits  as the bank s new fastforward checking product  introduced in the third quarter of  grew to million at december  net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
average balances and net interest income analysis 
the accompanying table sets forth  for the years through  information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant yields or rates  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

liquidity and cash flow market and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources 
liquidity management refers to the policies and practices that ensure the bank has the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the bank s customers 
management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of  and demands for  funds on a daily and other periodic bases 
deposit withdrawals  loan funding and general corporate activity create the primary needs for liquidity for the bank 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investments available for sale  loan repayments  loan sales  increases in deposits  and increases in borrowings from the fhlb secured with pledged loans and securities  and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines and securities sold under repurchase agreements

loan terms are typically limited to five years  with payments through the date of maturity generally based on a year year for owner occupied single and multi family properties amortization schedule 
interest rates may be fixed or adjustable  based on market conditions  and the bank generally charges an origination fee 
management has attempted to reduce credit risk in the real estate portfolio by emphasizing loans on owner occupied office  multi family and retail buildings where the loan to value ratio  established by independent appraisals  does not exceed to  and net projected cash flow available for debt service amounts to at least to of the debt service requirement 
the bank also generally requires personal guarantees and personal financial statements from the principal owners in such cases 
real estate mortgage 
the bank originates fixed and adjustable rate mortgages as well as fha  va and usda government supported loans for resale into the secondary market 
the bank provides bank held mortgage products to accommodate qualified borrowers who do not meet all the standards for a conventional secondary market mortgage 
during the bank originated million of loans in these various categories 
also included in real estate mortgage loans are home equity revolving lines of credit  with million outstanding as of december  real estate construction loans 
the bank s current lending strategy is to reduce exposure in this portfolio segment 
the bank expects that the majority of its new construction and development loans on commercial and residential projects will be in the range of  to million 
at december  and  the bank held million and million  respectively of such loans 
to reduce credit risk associated with such loans  the bank emphasizes small commercial centers that are substantially preleased  or residential projects that 
table of contents are substantially presold and built in strong  proven markets 
the leases on commercial projects must generally result in a loan to appraised value of to or less and a net cash flow to debt service of no less than to 
the bank typically requires a personal guarantee from the developer or builder 
loan terms are generally months  although the bank will make a mini permanent loan for purposes of construction and development of up to a five year term

at december   the bank held million of commercial loans  or of its total loan portfolio 
equipment loans are typically made on terms up to five years at fixed or variable rates  with the financed equipment pledged as collateral to the bank 
the bank attempts to reduce its credit risk on these loans by limiting the loan to value percentage to 
working capital loans are made on terms typically not exceeding one year 
these loans may be secured or unsecured  but the bank attempts to limit its credit risk by requiring the borrower to demonstrate its capacity to produce net cash flow available for debt service equal to to of its debt service requirements 
the bank experienced net chargeoffs from commercial loans of million in  million in  and million in consumer loans 
using a centralized underwriting process  the bank makes a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes  including i secured and unsecured installment and term loans originated directly by the bank  ii unsecured revolving lines of credit  and iii amortizing secured lot loans

loan approval and review 
when the aggregate outstanding loans to a single borrower or related entities exceed an individual officer s lending authority  the loan request must be considered and approved by an officer with a higher lending limit 
all consumer purpose loan decisions are made by the bank s central underwriting support group 
area executives can generally approve commercial relationships up to  if the lending request exceeds the area executive s lending limit  the loan must be submitted to and approved by a senior credit officer 
a senior credit officer has authority to approve commercial relationships up to  on a secured basis 
all loan relationships between  and  must be approved by the chief commercial credit officer ccco 
all loans between  and  must be approved by the chief credit officer cco 
loan relationships exceeding  up to  must be unanimously approved by a committee of the ccco  the cco  and the bank s chief executive officer ceo 
loan relationships over  must be approved by the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the bank s loan review program is headed by the loan review manager  who reports directly to the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the program includes the annual loan review coverage plan which is approved by the credit management committee and which stipulates a certain number of loan reviews to be completed by the loan review manager and employees under his or her guidance  and an additional number of loan reviews to be completed by independent loan review consulting firms 
in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
the watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the ccco  the special assets manager and the special assets officers  reviews all commercial loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and provides a summary to the credit management committee  also on a monthly basis 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the probability of default and on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses monthly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the watch loan committee of the bank to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 

table of contents the bank s loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines

see lending activities loan approval and review 
it is the responsibility of each commercial lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan they originate 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend appropriate changes in the borrower s risk grade 
currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information

risk profile by internally assigned risk grade in thousands december special sub special sub pass mention standard doubtful total pass mention standard doubtful total commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer other total the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the bank s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are generally viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures

the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market areas  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans because home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the 
table of contents appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
the function of determining the allowance for credit losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank

table of contents commercial loans 
all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
there is an increased reserve percentage for each successively higher risk grade 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
retail loans 
the retail loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of retail loans to determine a required reserve 
an additional reserve  equal to of all retail loans past due days or more  is added to the above 
specific impairment 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in significant loans considered impaired was approximately million and million  respectively and the specific allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of significant impaired loans held by the bank and the associated allowance for credit losses resulted  primary  from the bank s decision to take appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits through chargeoffs and foreclosure 
other potential problem loans 
loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss which do not fit the criteria to be considered significant are not evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
however  the bank closely monitors such loans as a result of their elevated risk profile 
as a result of the bank s disciplined and conservative loan classification methodology and the prolonged negative credit cycle  the balance of these other potential problem loans increased to million at december  from million at december  the loans that make up this category trended as management had projected and reached a peak level in the third quarter of these loans  while exhibiting signs of weakness  continue to perform pursuant to stated terms and conditions and therefore do not have identified expected losses 
approximately of the loans in this category are identified as commercial and industrial or income producing commercial real estate  which management assigns a lower probability of default and or loss given default 
the allowance for credit losses associated with such loans was million at december   which was based on a model that uses probability of default  and expected loss in the event of default  to determine expected losses within a given group of loans 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses totaled million  compared to million in as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  comprised of million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned 
those figures compare to million in nonperforming loans and million in other real estate owned at the end of  totaling million in nonperforming assets 
net chargeoffs decreased in to million  or of average loans outstanding  compared with million  or of average loans outstanding in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company charged off million of a million loan which represents subordinated debt to a financial institution 
the company does not have any other loans to financial institutions 
at december  and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of year end loans including loans held for sale was and  respectively 
the and results have been impacted by the continued weakness in the regional and national economies

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry  and are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the bank s allowance for credit losses  one of the most complex and judgmental accounting policies of the company 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary  if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used 
see additional discussion under asset quality above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company uses several interest rate risk measurement tools provided by a national asset liability management consultant to help manage this risk 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for acceptable levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations 
management provides the consultant with key assumptions  which are used as inputs into the measurement tools 
following is a summary of two different tools management uses on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
earnings simulation modeling 
net income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and the general market pressures affecting current market interest rates at the time of simulation 
many interest rate indices do not move uniformly  creating certain disunities between them 
for example  the spread between a day  prime based asset and a day  fhlb advance may not be uniform over time 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
simulation results are measured as a percentage change in net interest income compared to the static rate or base case scenario 
the model uses the company s current balance sheet  but considers decreases in asset and liability volumes based on prepayment assumptions as well as rate changes 
rate changes are modeled gradually over a month period  referred to as a rate ramp 
the model projects only changes in interest income and expense and does not project changes in non interest income  non interest expense  provision for loan losses or the impact of changing tax rates 
at december   net interest income simulation showed a negative change from the base case in a basis point ramped rising rate environment and a positive change from the base case in a basis point ramped declining rate environment 
the projected decrease in net interest income is within the asset liability committee s guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 

table of contents the following table summarizes the results of the company s income simulation model as of december  change in net interest income year year change in market interest rates basis point ramped increase base case no change basis point ramped decrease net portfolio value analysis 
net portfolio value npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any actions management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following is a summary of the results of the report compiled by the company s outside consultant using data and assumptions management provided as of december  estimated change in net portfolio value amount in s percent change in market interest rates basis point increase base case no change basis point decrease the preceding table indicates that  at december   in the event of a basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates  npv would be expected to decrease by million  or of the base case scenario value of million 
in the event of a decrease in prevailing market rates of basis points  npv would be expected to decline by million  or of the base case scenario value 
the projected decrease in npv is within the asset liability committee s guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 
interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s ceo  chief financial officer cfo and other senior executives 
the committee meets on a monthly basis to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the audit and risk management committee of the company s board of directors 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an interest rate index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying interest rate index
