item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview general 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
our principal programs are directed toward gastroenterology  oncology and virology 
we commenced principal operations in  became publicly traded in and throughout have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  developing manufacturing capabilities  establishing corporate collaborations and related activities 
on february   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with salix by which salix acquired the rights to relistor worldwide except in japan  where we have previously licensed to ono pharmaceutical the subcutaneous formulation of the drug 
we received a million upfront payment in cash and are eligible to receive development milestone payments of up to million contingent upon the achievement of specified us regulatory approvals and commercialization milestone payments of up to million contingent upon the achievement of specified us sales targets 
salix must pay us royalties based on a percentage ranging from to percent of net sales by it and its affiliates  and of any upfront  milestone  reimbursement or other revenue net of costs of goods sold  as defined  and territory specific research and development expense reimbursement it receives from sublicensees in respect of any country outside the us  as sublicensees commence their commercialization efforts 
salix is responsible for further developing and commercializing subcutaneous relistor worldwide except in japan  including completing clinical development necessary to support regulatory marketing approvals for potential new indications and formulations  and marketing and selling the product 
our sources of revenues for the three years ended december  have been payments under our collaboration agreements and funds from research grants and contracts from the nih related to our oncology and virology programs 
in june  we began recognizing royalty income from net sales by wyeth of subcutaneous relistor methylnaltrexone bromide 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents and we expect that those sales will not significantly increase over current levels in the near future 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
during  expenses for our relistor research program were million compared to million in and million in expenses for our cancer and hiv research programs were million and million  respectively  during compared to i million and million  respectively in and ii million and million  respectively  in our expenses and reimbursement revenue related to relistor in the future will depend on the amount of research and development work we perform pursuant to the development plan contemplated by the salix license agreement  which is to be finalized early in the second quarter of we also expect to incur a significant amount of development expenses for our other programs as these programs progress 
during each year of the three year period ended december   less than percent of our non relistor expenses were reimbursed through government funding 
from january to october  we recognized revenues from wyeth for i reimbursement of our development expenses for relistor as incurred  ii in respect of amortization of the million upfront payment we received over the period of our development obligations  iii for milestones achieved during the collaboration and for royalties earned based on net sales of relistor 
other than potential revenues from the relistor franchise  we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from royalties  product sales or otherwise  in the near term 
we will require additional funding to continue our current programs to completion  which may involve collaboration agreements  licenses or sale transactions or royalty sales or financings with respect to our products and product candidates 
we may also seek to raise additional capital through sales of common stock or other securities  and expect to continue funding some programs in part through government awards 
funding may not  however  be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we continue to monitor our program expenditures  including headcount levels  in conjunction with program and program candidates that we choose or are obligated to undertake 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses during the near term 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from million at december  we expect that this amount  together with the million upfront cash payment received from salix  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond one year 
if  however  we are unable to conclude favorable collaboration  license  asset sale  capital raising or other financing transactions  we will have to reduce  delay or eliminate spending on some current operations  and or reduce salary and other overhead expenses  to extend our remaining operations 
gastroenterology 
our first commercial product is relistor methylnaltrexone bromide subcutaneous injection  a first in class therapy for opioid induced constipation approved for sale in over countries worldwide  including the us  us  canada and australia 
marketing applications are pending elsewhere throughout the world 

table of contents relistor has previously been developed and commercialized worldwide except japan by progenics and wyeth pursuant to a collaboration agreement that was terminated in october under our transition agreement with wyeth  wyeth is continuing to distribute relistor worldwide other than japan through march  no royalties are payable in respect of net sales after september  the parties plan an april  transition of us commercial responsibility to salix from wyeth  and are currently discussing transition of ex us commercialization responsibilities on a country by country basis 
while salix effects a country by country transition of ex us commercialization rights  wyeth continues to supply product 
under the transition agreement  wyeth paid us million in six quarterly installments through january  and continued to pay royalties on ex us sales as provided in the collaboration agreement except to the extent certain fourth quarter financial targets were not met 
these targets were not met during the fourth quarter and royalties on ex us sales were not payable to us 
no other royalties are payable in respect of net sales after september  wyeth is also providing financial resources of approximately million  of which we have recognized million  which constitutes reimbursement for development of a multi dose pen for subcutaneous relistor 
revenue from this financial support for which we perform research and development is reported as reimbursement revenue from wyeth under the transition agreement 
we have agreed to purchase wyeth s remaining inventory of subcutaneous relistor at the end of the sales periods on agreed upon terms and conditions  and salix has agreed to purchase our inventory of subcutaneous relistor on similar agreed upon terms and conditions 
we have no further obligations to wyeth under the collaboration agreement 
our october out license to ono pharmaceutical of the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan is unaffected by the salix license agreement and termination of the wyeth collaboration 
in june  ono began clinical testing in japan of relistor subcutaneous injection and in initiated a phase trial designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety 
we have received us  us and canadian approvals to market relistor in pre filled syringes  which are designed to ease preparation and administration for patients and caregivers  and currently plan to coordinate the launch of that product with salix in we are also developing subcutaneous relistor for treatment of oic outside the advanced illness setting  in individuals with non cancer pain 
based on the results from a recently completed one year  open label safety study  together with results from a previous phase efficacy trial  we plan to submit regulatory filings in the first half of in the us  us and elsewhere for approval of subcutaneous relistor to treat oic in the non cancer pain setting 
as part of our reacquisition of relistor  we assumed development responsibilities for an oral formulation of relistor for the treatment of oic in patients with non cancer pain and are conducting a phase trial of oral methylnaltrexone in this patient population  which pursuant to our license agreement will continue as part of salix s development responsibilities for relistor pursuant to the development plan contemplated by the salix license agreement  which is to be finalized early in the second quarter of under the license agreement  expenses we incur for development or other work that we perform at salix s direction is reimbursable to us by salix 
our collaboration agreement with wyeth was terminated by the october transition agreement  but the agreement remained in effect for the time periods prior to termination covered by this report 
prior to the transition agreement  we received upfront  milestone and royalty payments from wyeth  and were reimbursed for expenses we incurred in connection with the development of relistor  manufacturing and commercialization expenses for relistor were funded by wyeth 
at inception of the wyeth collaboration  wyeth paid to us a million non refundable upfront payment 
wyeth made million in milestone payments thereafter 
costs for the development of relistor incurred by wyeth or us starting january  through termination of the collaboration agreement were paid by wyeth 
we were reimbursed by wyeth for our development costs based on the number of our full time equivalent employees ftes devoted to the development project  all subject to wyeth s audit rights and possible reconciliation 
during the applicable royalty periods  wyeth was obligated to pay us royalties on net sales  as defined which included specified sales deductions  of relistor by wyeth throughout the world other than japan  where we licensed rights to subcutaneous relistor to ono 
wyeth s ex us royalty obligations continued through the end of as provided in the transition agreement 
no royalties are payable in respect of net sales after september  under our license agreement with ono  in october we out licensed rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan in return for an upfront payment of million and the right to receive potential milestones  upon achievement of development responsibilities by ono  of up to million  commercial milestones and royalties on sales by ono of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono also has the option to acquire from us the rights to develop and commercialize in japan other formulations of relistor on terms to be negotiated separately 
ono may request us to perform activities related to its development and commercialization responsibilities beyond our participation in joint committees and specified technology transfer related tasks which will be at its expense  and reimbursable at the time we perform these services 

table of contents royalty and milestone payments will depend on success in development and commercialization of relistor  which is dependent on many factors  such as the actions of salix  ono and wyeth until completion of its responsibilities during the transition and any other business partner s with which we may collaborate  decisions by the fda and other regulatory bodies  the outcome of clinical and other testing of relistor  and our own efforts 
many of these matters are outside our control 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that salix will be successful in furthering the development and commercialization of the relistor franchise 
we also cannot guarantee  in light of wyeth s limited obligations under the transition agreement  its acquisition by pfizer and its limited ongoing commercial interest in the relistor franchise  that wyeth s efforts during the transition will achieve any particular level of success in marketing and sales  regulatory approval or clinical development of subcutaneous relistor 
in our other gastroenterology efforts  we have recently presented preclinical data on novel monoclonal antibodies against toxins produced by the bacterium clostridium difficile c 
difficile  the leading cause of hospital acquired diarrhea in the us and a recognized growing global public health challenge 
oncology and virology 
we recently announced preliminary data from a phase clinical trial of a fully human monoclonal adc directed against psma for the treatment of prostate cancer and recently presented data from preclinical studies of novel multiplex phosphoinositide kinase pik inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
in the area of virology  we have been developing a viral entry inhibitor a humanized monoclonal antibody  pro for hiv  the virus that causes aids  and are conducting a clinical trial of pro with outside funding 
we are also evaluating hepatitis c virus entry inhibitors as possible development candidates 
advancement of pro  including clinical trial efforts  is subject to obtaining additional outside funding  for which we have applied to government agencies

we analyzed the facts and circumstances of the non refundable milestones and believe that they met those criteria for revenue recognition upon achievement of the respective milestones 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
from the inception of the wyeth collaboration through december   we recognized revenue for the entire  upfront payment   as reimbursement for our development costs  and a total of  for non refundable milestone payments 
we do not expect to receive additional reimbursement revenue under the collaboration due to its termination 
wyeth  at its expense  is continuing certain ongoing development efforts for subcutaneous relistor 
this support is ongoing and continues until completion of its responsibilities during the transition 

table of contents we recognize a portion of the upfront payment in a reporting period in accordance with the proportionate performance method  which is based on the percentage of actual effort performed on our development obligations in that period relative to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement and budget approved by wyeth and us 
during the third quarter of  a revised budget was approved  which extended our performance period to the end of and  thereby  decreased the amount of revenue we recognized in each reporting period 
the transition agreement shortened the obligation period from the end of to october and we recognized the remaining million of unamortized upfront payment as revenue during the fourth quarter of ono license agreement 
in october  we entered into a license agreement with ono and in november  received an upfront payment of  and recorded this amount as deferred revenue current as of december  we are entitled to receive potential milestones and royalty payments

research grants and contract 
in september  we were awarded a three year nih grant totaling million to partially fund research and pre clinical development of our humanized monoclonal antibodies against the disease causing toxins produced by c 
difficile 
in june  we were awarded a five year nih grant  subject to annual funding approvals and customary compliance obligations  totaling up to million to continue the development of a prophylactic vaccine provax designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
prior to this award  the program was funded by a nih contract which expired in  and through that date  we recognized revenue of million 
in november  we received as part of the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project  which provides grants or tax credits for expenses we incurred in and on research aimed at creating new therapies  reducing long term healthcare costs  and or significantly advancing the goal of curing cancer within the next years 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  as revenue from federal government grants and grants in lieu of tax credits  consisting of awards made to us by the nih and internal revenue service between and  to partially fund our provax hiv vaccine  pro  psma  c 
difficile and hcv programs

revenues from research grants and contract from the nih decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december    and  from grants and and  from the nih contract for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in grant and contract revenue resulted from fewer active grants and reimbursable expenses in than in  and the expiration of the nih contract in december other revenues  primarily from orders for research reagents  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and from for the year ended december

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have to date relied principally on external funding  the wyeth collaboration  royalty and product revenue to finance our operations 
we have funded operations through private placements of equity securities  public offerings of common stock  payments received under collaboration agreements  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  and the sale of our common stock under our two employee stock purchase plans purchase plans 
under the february salix license agreement  we received a million upfront payment in cash and are eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones plus royalties on net sales and of any upfront  milestone  reimbursement or other revenue net of costs of goods sold  as defined  and territory specific research and development expense reimbursement salix receives from non us sublicensees 
our expenses and reimbursement revenue related to relistor in the future will depend on the amount of research and development work we perform pursuant to the development plan contemplated by the salix license agreement  which is to be finalized early in the second quarter of we continue to monitor our other program expenditures  including headcount levels  in conjunction with program and program candidates that we choose or are obligated to undertake 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses during the near term 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future arrangements  or how they would affect our capital requirements 
the consummation of other agreements would further allow us to advance other projects with current funds 
advancement of the pro program is subject to obtaining outside funding  for which we have applied to government agencies 
while we have to date conducted psma adc research and development on our own  we are considering as appropriate strategic collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies for psma adc 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from million at december  we expect that this amount  together with the million upfront cash payment from salix  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond on year 
in addition  at december  and  our investment in auction rate securities classified as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets amounted to million and million  respectively 
if  however  we are unable to enter into favorable collaboration  license  asset sale  capital raising or other financing transactions  we will have to reduce  delay or eliminate spending on some current operations  and or reduce salary and other overhead expenses  to extend our remaining operations 
our cash flow from operating activities was negative for the years ended december   and due primarily to the excess of expenditures on our research and development programs and general and administrative costs over cash received from collaborators and government grants and contracts to fund such programs  as described below

during the years ended december   and  we received million  million and million  respectively  from wyeth  consisting of i  million and million as reimbursements and milestones payments under the wyeth collaboration  ii million  million and under the transition agreement  and iii million  million and million in royalties 
reimbursements under the collaboration have ceased as a result of its termination 
under the transition agreement  wyeth paid us million in six quarterly installments through january  and continued to pay royalties on ex us sales as provided in the collaboration agreement except to the extent certain fourth quarter financial targets were not met 
these targets were not met during the fourth quarter and royalties on ex us sales were not payable to us 
no royalties are payable in respect of net sales after september  royalties or other revenues from relistor after this transition period will be dependent on salix s and its sublicensees commercialization efforts 
wyeth is also providing financial resources of approximately million  of which we have recognized million  which constitutes reimbursement for development of a multi dose pen for subcutaneous relistor 
this support  which has generally been made available by us to salix under the salix license agreement  is ongoing and continues beyond the extended periods of wyeth s commercialization obligations  revenue from such financial support for which we perform research and development is reported as reimbursement revenue from wyeth under the transition agreement 
we have agreed to purchase wyeth s remaining inventory of subcutaneous relistor at the end of the sales periods on agreed upon terms and conditions  and salix has agreed to purchase our inventory of subcutaneous relistor on similar agreed upon terms and conditions 
we have no further obligations to wyeth under the collaboration agreement 

table of contents under our license agreement with ono  we received from ono  in november  an upfront payment of million  which was recognized as revenue during the first quarter of  upon satisfaction of our performance obligations  and are entitled to receive potential milestone payments  upon achievement of development milestones by ono  of up to million  commercial milestones and royalties on sales of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono is also responsible for development and commercialization costs for subcutaneous relistor in japan 
we are partially funding c 
difficile research and pre clinical development of our provax hiv vaccine program through contracts with the nih providing for research  pre clinical development and early clinical testing support 
in september  we were awarded a three year nih grant totaling million in support of the c 
difficile program 
for provax hiv  through december  we recognized revenue of million from the nih  including million for the achievement of two milestones  and in june were awarded a new five year nih grant totaling up to million to continue this work  subject to annual funding approvals and customary compliance obligations 
a portion of our revenues is derived from federal government awards 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized as revenue awards made to us by the nih between and  to partially fund some of our programs 
for the years ended december   and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of revenue from all of our nih awards including the million internal revenue service grant in changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable for the years ended december   and resulted from the timing of receipts from the nih and wyeth  and payments made to trade vendors in the normal course of business 
other than amounts to be received from salix  wyeth  ono and from currently approved grants  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than revenues from relistor  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years  as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our product candidates to the commercial marketing stage 
investing activities 
we redeem money market funds and use proceeds from maturities to provide funding for operations 
a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents million are guaranteed by the us treasury or federal deposit insurance corporation s guarantee program 
our auction rate securities million include million of securities collateralized by student loan obligations subsidized by the us government 
these investments  while rated investment grade by the standard poor s and moody s rating agencies and predominantly having scheduled maturities greater than ten years  are heavily concentrated in the us financial sector  which continues to be under stress 
as a result of changes in general market conditions during  we determined to reduce the principal amount of auction rate securities in our portfolio as they came up for auction 
as a result  at december   we continue to hold approximately million of auction rate securities and to date  we have received all scheduled interest payments on these securities 
we will not realize cash in respect of the principal amount of these securities until the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid  or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we monitor markets for our investments  but cannot guarantee that additional losses will not be required to be recorded 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
our money market funds are purchased and  in the case of auction rate securities  sold by third party brokers in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
our brokerage account requires that all securities be held to maturity unless authorization is obtained from us to sell earlier 
in fact  we had a history of holding all securities to maturity prior to the second quarter of  when we decided to sell a portion of our securities which had scheduled maturities between the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of the proceeds from these sales were million  resulting in a gain of million 
we expect to recover the amortized cost of all of our investments at maturity 
because we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business and believe it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of principal  we do not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  
table of contents financing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we received cash of million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees  directors and non employee consultants and from the sale of our common stock under our purchase plans 
the amount of cash we receive from these sources fluctuates commensurate with headcount levels and changes in the price of our common stock on the grant date for options exercised  and on the sale date for shares sold under the purchase plans 
under the transition agreement  wyeth is providing financial resources of approximately million  of which we have recognized million  which constitutes reimbursement for development of a multi dose pen for subcutaneous relistor 
this support  which has been made available by us to salix under the salix license agreement  is ongoing and continues beyond the extended periods of wyeth s commercialization obligations  revenue from such financial support prior to the salix license agreement has been reported as reimbursement revenue from wyeth under the transition agreement 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for additional product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to our additional technologies  we will be required to fund our operations in the future through sales of common stock or other securities  royalty or other financing agreements and or grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us may seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
uses of cash operating activities 
the majority of our cash has been used to advance our research and development programs 
we currently have major research and development programs in gastroenterology  oncology and virology  and are conducting several smaller research projects in those latter areas 
under the transition agreement  we have agreed to purchase wyeth s remaining inventory of subcutaneous relistor at the end of its sales periods on agreed upon terms and conditions  and salix has agreed to purchase our inventory of subcutaneous relistor on similar agreed upon terms and conditions 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
for various reasons  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials  our dependence in certain instances on third parties and the uncertainty of the specific nature of relistor related future arrangements and relationships following termination of the wyeth collaboration  many of which are outside of our control  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete all our research and development programs 
for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred  by project  were as follows in millions relistor cancer hiv other programs total we will require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  file and prosecute patent applications and enforce or defend patent claims  if any  and fund product in licensing and any possible acquisitions 
investing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we have spent million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures 
these expenditures have been primarily related to leasehold improvements and the purchase of laboratory equipment for our research and development projects 
financing activities 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  of our outstanding common shares for a total of million 
we did not repurchase any common shares during the years ended december  and 
table of contents contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements payments due by year end total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements total based on assumed achievement of milestones covered under each agreement  the timing and payment of which is highly uncertain 
we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of each of our programs to determine if continued research and development is commercially and economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development in these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete research and development projects in a timely manner or failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase capital requirements and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be deviations from that plan that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no obligations under off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab and asc revenue recognition 

table of contents collaborations may contain substantive milestone payments to which we apply the substantive milestone method substantive milestone method 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payment is non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  iv the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and v a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be part of the consideration and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon net sales of related licensed products 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period the sales occur  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement providing for the royalty 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  they would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  recognized as such obligations are performed under the proportionate performance method 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research or steering or other committee services  could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value  or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
under the proportionate performance method we recognize revenue provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents will typically be used as the measure of performance 
revenue is recognized in any period as the percent of actual effort expended in that period relative to total effort for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
significant judgment and estimates are required in determining the nature and assignment of tasks to be accomplished by each of the parties and the level of effort required for us to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
the nature and assignment of tasks to be performed by each party involves the preparation  discussion and approval by the parties of a development plan and budget 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s current operating budget with the collaborator for the total effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
as the development programs progress over time  the development budgets  including the amount of ftes  may be revised  resulting in a change to the development period or costs 
changes in the development estimates are likely to affect the amount of revenue recognized in the period of change and each year in the future as compared to prior periods 
under the wyeth collaboration  we recognized million less revenue from the million upfront payment during the year ended december  compared to the amounts recognized in due to an extension of the development budget from december  to december  conversely  we recognized million more revenue during compared to amounts recognized in due to the increase in the percent of actual effort expended in relative to the total remaining effort to complete development 
share based payment arrangements 
our share based compensation to employees includes non qualified stock options  restricted stock and shares issued under our purchase plans  which are compensatory under asc compensation stock compensation 
we account for share based compensation to non employees  including non qualified stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with asc equity 
the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model requires input assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock  which is based upon the daily quoted market prices on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term  ii the period of time over which employees  officers  our chief executive officer  vice chairman  directors and non employee consultants are expected to hold their options prior to exercise  iii zero expected dividend yield due to never having paid dividends and not expecting to pay dividends in the future  and iv risk free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the options  which are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

table of contents historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since it provides the most reliable indication of future volatility 
future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation  historical data is available for the length of the option s expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based upon historical data related to exercise and post termination cancellation activity 
the expected term of stock options granted to our chief executive officer  vice chairman and non employee directors and consultants are calculated separately from stock options granted to employees and officers 
we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
changes in the assumptions used to compute the fair value of the option awards are likely to affect the fair value of the non qualified stock option awards and the amount of compensation expense recognized in future periods 
a higher volatility  longer expected term and higher risk free rate increases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
conversely  a lower volatility  shorter expected term and lower risk free rate decreases the resulting compensation expense recognized in future periods as compared to prior periods 
for performance based stock option awards vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
we estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
in the case of the executive s options  the explicit service period is nine years and eleven months from the respective grant dates 
the implied service periods related to the performance conditions are the estimated times for each performance condition to be achieved 
thus  compensation expense will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of performance conditions for that award assuming that the performance conditions will be achieved before the cliff vesting occurs 
for performance and market based stock option awards to our vice chairman consisting of options in and and options and restricted stock in and chief executive officer consisting of options in vesting occurs on the basis of the achievement of specified performance or market based milestones 
the options have an exercise price equal to the closing price on our common stock on the date of grant 
the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation and the expense related to these grants will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of the performance or market conditions 
the awards will not vest unless one of the milestones is achieved or the market condition is met 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance or market condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
research and development expenses including clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed as incurred  and are based on the total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in addition to clinical trial expenses  we estimate the amounts of other research and development expenses  for which invoices have not been received at the end of a period  based upon communication with third parties that have provided services or goods during the period 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
fair value measurements 
our available for sale investment portfolio consists of money market funds and auction rate securities  and is recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
the change in the fair value of these investments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss 
we continue to monitor markets for our investments and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 

table of contents we expect to recover the amortized cost of all of our investments at maturity 
currently  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business and we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of principal 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued asu to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered items shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if both i the delivered items have value to a collaborator on a stand alone basis  in that  the collaborator could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis  and ii the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item or items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
this asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  in april  the fasb issued asu  which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met when determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate and this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  we expect that the adoption of these asus will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  the amount is not known or able to be reasonably estimated at this time as we are currently evaluating the impact of the recently completed salix license agreement 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal 
our available for sale investments consist of money market funds and auction rate securities  all of which had interest rates that were variable and totaled million at december  as a result  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
as a result of changes in general market conditions during  we determined to reduce the principal amount of auction rate securities in our portfolio as they came up for auction and invest the proceeds in other securities in accordance with our investment guidelines 
at december   we continue to hold approximately million of assets measured at fair value of auction rate securities  in respect of which we have received all scheduled interest payments 
the principal amount of these remaining auction rate securities will not be accessible until the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider the impact  if any  of market conditions on the fair market value of our investments 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity  and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of these auction rate securities are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 
we re evaluated the valuation of these securities as of december  and the temporary impairment amount decreased thousand from thousand at december  to thousand 
a basis point increase to our internal analysis would result in an insignificant increase in the temporary impairment of these securities as of the year ended december
