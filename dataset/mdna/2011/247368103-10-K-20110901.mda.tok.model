item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook 
table of contents while we are encouraged with the results we achieved in fiscal year and with our long term prospects  the continued weakness in the global economy and extreme volatility in input costs are presenting unique obstacles 
in fiscal year we will need to manage through the higher cost cotton rolling through cost of sales  impacting our second and third fiscal quarters most significantly 
over the last several years we have continued to improve the performance of our manufacturing operations which we believe has improved our competitive position 
our continuous improvement and six sigma programs continued to lower product cost by improving yields  reducing waste and minimizing off quality production 
in fiscal year we expanded the output in most of our manufacturing facilities which leverages our fixed costs and provides additional volume to sell 
we ran our manufacturing at capacity during fiscal year and currently expect to continue this into fiscal year  taking advantage of the capacity expansions we completed over the past twelve months 
our customer base for private label and decorated products is expanding and should add revenue in our basics segment for the upcoming year 
market demand for our private label programs remains strong  driven by consumer demand for our customers products and the high service levels required in this marketplace 
demand for undecorated tees has recently weakened causing additional challenges in the catalog tee business 
we expect our branded segment to continue its growth trends in the upcoming year with improved operating margins 
our soffe business continues to gain new doors  particularly with the sporting goods distribution channel 
during fiscal year we completed most of the integration work on the cotton exchange and expect to see the benefits of this in fiscal year we are seeing positive trends in our junkfood business and expect sales growth in fiscal year  driven by solid business with the gap  along with improved results with boutiques and upper tier retailers 
junkfood has been focused on brand building  resulting in strong press coverage over the past six months 
we expect strong sales at to the game in fiscal year driven from sales of salt life r products and under armor licensed headwear 
salt life r product offerings should be available in a growing number of doors over an expanded geographic area as fiscal year unfolds 
in december we expect to open a flagship salt life r store  design lab and showroom in jacksonville beach  florida  giving us an exciting venue to display new products  meet with customers  and get consumer feedback in a real salt life environment 
we expect to operate our digital printing operation at art gun at full print capacity during the holiday season and we are working on strategies to build volume throughout the rest of the year 
art gun continues to attract new customers across different different business platforms 
we will soon be launching an improved delta catalog website and are developing a marketing strategy to allow this customer base to utilize our custom design and decorating capabilities 
in january we provided the investment community with three year targets  which included reaching sales of million  gross margins of thirty percent and earnings of per share 
we are ahead of our sales goals and believe we are building an operating platform and portfolio of brands and licensed properties which should allow us to reach our gross margin and earnings targets as raw material prices return to more traditional levels 
we do  however  remain concerned about the retail climate for apparel and the united states economy in general 
raw material prices remain volatile which adds uncertainty to our pricing and production strategies 
we have evaluated these heightened risk factors in setting our expectations for the upcoming year  but it is impossible to predict the full impact these conditions may have on our business 
earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending june   we expect net sales to be in the range of to million  an increase of to from fiscal year  all of which is expected to be organic growth 
earnings are expected to be in the range of to per diluted share in fiscal year our fiscal year guidance is based on the following assumptions organic sales growth of to driven primarily by higher average prices 
we expect to achieve sales growth in both our branded and basics segments  decline in gross margins of approximately to basis points for the year driven primarily from higher cotton and other raw material costs  partially offset by improved manufacturing costs as we gain efficiencies and further leverage our fixed expenses 
we will be bringing in yarn with the highest cotton cost in our first quarter of fiscal year  and expect the cotton cost to decline over the remaining quarters 
as this yarn flows through our manufacturing process and the finished goods are sold  we expect the highest cost inventory will be in our cost of sales during our second and third quarters of fiscal year  impacting gross margins most significantly in these quarters 
selling  general and administration costs are expected to decrease as a percentage of sales  as well as in gross dollars  from fiscal year due primarily to fiscal year including some one time expenses that are not expected to repeat in fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year is expected to be approximately 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million for fiscal year  which includes about to million 
table of contents to increase our textile and sewing capacity in order to meet expected sales growth 
depreciation and amortization  including non cash compensation  is expected to also be approximately million 
fiscal year free cash flows are expected to be approximately million and are expected to be used to reduce debt obligations and for other corporate purposes 
in fiscal year  we will face challenging market conditions resulting from the volatile cotton market  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions which continue to impact discretionary spending 
although we believe we have taken these risks  as well as other factors  into consideration as we determined our guidance for fiscal year  the significance of the challenges  many of which our outside of our control  creates heightened risk to the volatility of our earnings in the upcoming fiscal year 
in addition  although we believe that the assumptions described above are reasonable  if any of the assumptions proves to be incorrect  our results will differ from our expectations 
results of operations overview fiscal year marked another year of growth for delta apparel  inc and our eighth consecutive year of record revenue 
higher selling prices  coupled with continued marketing initiatives to gain new customers and expand business relationships with existing customers  drove organic sales growth of during fiscal year on top of the organic growth achieved in fiscal year the organic sales growth  coupled with the inclusion of revenue from the acquisition of the cotton exchange  resulted in record sales of million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
our operating profit increased million to million  or of sales  in fiscal year  resulting in net income of million  or per diluted share 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year as we further developed our tax planning strategies 
in addition to growing our top line and expanding our profits  we also continued to focus on managing the capital in the business 
the rise of cotton prices during the year and resulting increases in selling prices significantly increased our net working capital requirements 
even with the increased investment in working capital  we generated positive cash flows from operations during fiscal year we continued to invest in the growth of our business through the acquisition of the cotton exchange in july  and with capital expenditures to further expand our manufacturing capacity  lower our costs and improve our information technology platforms 
overall  we believe we have many opportunities to continue our sales growth and further improve our profitability in the upcoming years 
in fiscal year  we will face challenging market conditions resulting from the volatile cotton market  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions which continue to impact discretionary spending 
we believe our broad channels of distribution and diversified product offerings  along with our prudent capital management  should serve us well during these more challenging times 
quarterly financial data for information regarding quarterly financial data  refer to note quarterly financial information unaudited to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  a million increase from the prior year sales of million 
the sales increase resulted from organic sales growth of and the additional revenue from the acquisition of the cotton exchange 
both segments contributed to the increase with an increase in our basics segment and a increase in our branded segment 
sales in the branded segment were million  or approximately of total sales 
revenue from the cotton exchange  which we acquired in july  drove a increase in the branded segment revenue from the prior year 
soffe apparel  coupled with the new salt life collection  also contributed to the growth  being partially offset by lower sales of junk food merchandise 
sales within the basics segment increased to million  or of our total revenue 
the organic growth in the basics segment was driven by a increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in units sold 
gross margins improved basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from higher average selling prices within our basics segment combined with efficiencies gained from our vertical manufacturing platform 
during fiscal year  we increased capacity and operated our manufacturing facilities full throughout the entire year 
we gained efficiencies  improved quality and lowered costs in manufacturing through our continuous improvement initiatives and leveraging of fixed costs with the additional production capacity added during the year 
the improved gross margins in our basics segment were partially offset by a decline in our branded segment margins due to lower sales of our vintage licensed products and higher operational expenses associated with salt life 
table of contents and the digital printing business 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
selling expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily because we made investments in consumer brand marketing campaigns to promote future growth of our branded products 
general and administrative expenses also increased as a percentage of sales with costs associated with the acquisition of the cotton exchange  expenses related to art gun and higher performance based compensation expense associated with our improved operating results and stock price 
our operating profit was million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
operating income in the branded and basics segments were million and million  respectively 
the branded segment operating income included a non cash net favorable adjustment of million related to the valuation of the art gun contingent consideration and goodwill 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  a reduction of million  or  from million for fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal year resulting from the expiration of interest rate swap and collar agreements in march our fiscal year effective income tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the decrease is due to having a higher percentage of pre tax earnings in foreign tax free locations compared to earnings in the united states and foreign taxable locations 
during fiscal year  we further developed our tax planning strategies  allowing us to keep more profits in honduras  a tax free zone  reducing our overall effective tax rate 
net income for fiscal year was million  a million increase from net income of million in fiscal year fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales during fiscal year increased by million to million  a increase from fiscal year the sales improvement resulted from organic growth of approximately  along with having the full year of sales from to the game  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  fiscal year included weeks of operations compared to weeks of operations in fiscal year each of our business units contributed to the organic sales growth  which was on top of an organic sales growth in fiscal year basics sales increased to million in fiscal year driven primarily from higher volumes and an increase in average selling prices during the second half of fiscal year sales in the branded segment increased to million in fiscal year  a increase from the prior year driven from strong sales growth from our junk food products and a full year of sales from to the game  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross profit improved basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from in the prior year 
in fiscal year we benefited from a full year of lower cost production from our honduran textile operations  improving our results over the prior year by approximately million  adding basis points to our gross margins 
driven primarily from increased demand for our products  we operated our manufacturing facilities near capacity in the second half of the year  reducing our shutdown costs compared to the prior year by approximately million  or basis points 
the remaining improvement in gross margins resulted from effective merchandising strategies and operational improvements 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  an increase from of sales in the prior year 
the increase was primarily driven from the higher selling costs associated with branded products  which includes the royalty expense associated with the sale of licensed products 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was also due to higher performance based compensation expense from the improved financial performance and increased stock price during fiscal year compared to fiscal year our operating profit was million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
the branded segment contributed million in operating income and the basics segment had operating income of million 
other income for fiscal years and was million  primarily related to our investment in the joint venture of the industrial park where ceiba textiles is located 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million for fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt levels and lower average interest rates compared to the prior year 
during fiscal year  our average interest rate was compared to in fiscal year our fiscal year effective income tax rate was  compared to in fiscal year the primary driver for the 
table of contents increase in fiscal year was due to having a higher percentage of pre tax earnings in the united states and foreign taxable locations compared to earnings in foreign tax free locations 
profits that are permanently reinvested in the tax free zone of honduras are relatively fixed since this amount is based on a cost plus determination based on our production output 
therefore  our effective tax rate increased during fiscal year because our us profits increased while our honduran tax free profits remained relatively constant 
the higher effective tax rate compared to the prior fiscal year negatively impacted our earnings by approximately per diluted share 
net income for fiscal year was million  a million increase from fiscal year net income of million 
liquidity and capital resources credit facility and other financial obligations on may   delta apparel  soffe  junkfood  to the game  art gun and tcx entered into a fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended loan agreement with the financial institutions named in the amended loan agreement as lenders  wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  wells fargo capital finance  llc  as sole lead arranger  and wells fargo capital finance  llc and merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  as joint bookrunners 
in connection with the amended loan agreement  israel discount bank of new york was removed from the syndicate of lenders under the credit facility  and bank of america  na was added to the syndicate of lenders 
pursuant to the amended loan agreement  the maturity of the loans under the previously existing credit facility was extended to may  and the line of credit was increased to million subject to borrowing base limitations  which represents an increase of million in the amount that was previously available under the credit facility 
under the amended loan agreement  provided that no event of default exists  we have the option to increase the maximum credit available under the facility to million subject to borrowing base limitations  conditioned upon the agent ability to secure additional commitments and customary closing conditions 
at july   we had million outstanding under our credit facility at an average interest rate of  and had the ability to borrow an additional million 
for further information regarding our us asset based secured credit facility  refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we renegotiated our loan agreement with banco ficohsa  a honduran bank 
proceeds from the new loan agreement were used to extinguish the existing loan indebtedness and resulted in no gain or loss being recorded upon extinguishment 
as of july   we had a total of million outstanding on this loan 
for further information regarding our honduran credit facility  refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our primary cash needs are for working capital and capital expenditures  as well as to fund share repurchases under our stock repurchase program 
in addition  in the future we may use cash to pay dividends 
derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for purposes of trading or speculation 
when we enter into a derivative instrument  we determine whether hedge accounting can be applied 
where hedge accounting can be applied  a hedge relationship is designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
the hedge is documented at inception  detailing the particular risk objective and strategy considered for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation identifies the specific asset or liability being hedged  the risk being hedged  the type of derivative used and how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate of 
this agreement terminated on april  on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate of 
this agreement will terminate on september  we assessed these agreements and concluded that the swap agreements match the exact terms of the underlying debt to which it is related and therefore is considered a highly effective hedge 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of income taxes  until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements resulted in an aoci gain  net of taxes  of million and million for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
operating cash flows 
table of contents operating activities for fiscal year provided million in cash compared to million in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year the decrease in operating cash flow during fiscal year compared to the prior year resulted primarily from higher working capital needs driven from higher raw material costs in inventory and increased sales 
this increase was partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued expensed caused primarily from the higher raw material costs 
the cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from net income combined with lower inventory levels as we increased our inventory turns through improved processing and new business operating systems 
investing cash flows cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we used million in cash for the purchase of property and equipment and acquired the cotton exchange for million in cash 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of the cotton exchange 
in fiscal year  we used million for the purchase of property and equipment 
in addition  we made the final payment of million associated with the acquisition of to the game  llc and completed the acquisition of art gun for million 
capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment for fiscal year were million 
these expenditures were primarily to improve our information technology in both our branded and basics segments and to increase capacity and lower costs in our manufacturing facilities which support both our branded and basics segments 
we spent million in fiscal year on capital expenditures primarily to improve our manufacturing platform and business operating systems 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal year  which includes approximately to million to increase textile and sewing capacity to meet the expected future sales growth 
in addition  we will continue to invest to consolidate and improve our information systems and on maintenance capital in our manufacturing and distribution facilities 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million compared to cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal year the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was used to fund the acquisition of the cotton exchange  for capital expenditures and for the purchase of our common stock 
during fiscal year we used our cash from operating activities  net of our investing activities  to reduce our debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to make principal payments on our loan with banco ficohsa 
future liquidity and capital resources based on our expectations  we believe that our credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital needs  and that the cash flow generated by our operations and funds available under our credit line should be sufficient to service our debt payment requirements  to satisfy our day to day working capital needs and to fund our planned capital expenditures 
any material deterioration in our results of operations  however  may result in our losing the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers or may cause the borrowing availability under our facility to be insufficient for our needs 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of july   by future period 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases capital leases letters of credit minimum royalty payments purchase obligations total b a we exclude interest payments from these amounts because the cash outlay for the interest is unknown and can not be reliably estimated because the majority of the debt is under a revolving credit facility 
interest payments will be determined based upon the daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the prevailing interest rate during that time 
b we excluded deferred income tax liabilities of million from the contractual cash obligations table because we believe 
table of contents inclusion would not be meaningful 
refer to note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods and therefore would not relate to liquidity needs 
as a result  including deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period in the schedule could be misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as defined by item a of regulation s k promulgated by the sec other than the letters of credit  operating leases  and purchase obligations described above 
we have entered into derivative interest rate contracts as described and included below in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
dividends and purchases of our own shares under our credit agreement  we are allowed to make cash dividends and stock repurchases if i as of the date of the payment or repurchase and after giving effect to the payment or repurchase  we have availability on that date of not less than million and average availability for the day period immediately preceding that date of not less than million  and ii the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases after may  does not exceed million plus of our cumulative net income as defined in the amended loan agreement from the first day of fiscal year to the date of determination 
at july  and july   there was million and million  respectively  of retained earnings free of restrictions to make cash dividends or stock repurchases 
our board of directors did not declare  nor were any dividends paid  during fiscal years and we would expect that our board of directors would consider the advisability of instituting a dividend program in the future 
any future cash dividend payments will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors 
as of july   our board of directors had authorized management to use up to million to repurchase delta apparel stock in open market transactions under our stock repurchase program 
during fiscal year  we purchased  shares of our common stock for a total cost of million 
no purchases of our common stock were made during fiscal years and as of july   we have purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate of million since the inception of the stock repurchase program 
all purchases were made at the discretion of management 
as of july   million remained available for future purchases under our stock repurchase program  which does not have an expiration date 
on august   our board of directors approved a million increase in our stock repurchase program  bringing the total amount authorized to million 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  inventory and related reserves  the carrying value of goodwill  stock based compensation and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized when ownership is transfered to the customer  which includes not only the passage of title  but also the transfer of the risk of loss related to the product 
at this point  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and we are reasonably assured of the collectibility of the sale 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
shipping and handling charges billed to our customers are 
table of contents included in net revenue and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold 
revenues are reported on net sales basis  which is computed by deducting product returns  discounts and estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
accounts receivable and related reserves in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based upon defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of related reserves 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
in situations where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  reserves are determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
in addition  reserves are established for other concessions that have been extended to customers  including advertising  markdowns and other accommodations  net of historical recoveries 
these reserves are determined based upon historical deduction trends and evaluation of current market conditions 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or further weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories and related reserves we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
inventory cost includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead on manufactured inventory  and all direct and associated costs  including inbound freight  to acquire sourced products 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record reserves for obsolescence  excess quantities  irregulars and slow moving inventory based on historical selling prices  current market conditions  and forecasted product demand to reduce inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if sell through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill and contingent consideration goodwill and definite lived intangibles were recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions of junkfood clothing company and art gun 
we did not record any indefinite lived intangibles associated with either of these acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired  and is required to be written down when impaired 
the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors  including sales  gross margins  selling  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  cash flows and the selection of an appropriate discount rate  all of which are subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
when we perform goodwill impairment testing  our assumptions are based on annual business plans and other forecasted results 
we select a discount rate  which is used to reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows  based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment assessment 
see note m significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our remeasurement of contingent consideration and testing for goodwill impairment  which information is herein incorporated by reference 
given the current macro economic environment and the uncertainties regarding its potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions used in our impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved  it is possible that an impairment review may be triggered and goodwill may be determined to be impaired 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is accounted for under the provisions of fasb codification no 
 compensation stock compensation asc  the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
asc requires all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense over the vesting period using a fair value method 
we estimate the fair value of stock based compensation using the black scholes options pricing model 
this model requires that we estimate a risk free interest rate  the volatility of the price of our common stock  the dividend yield  and the expected life of the awards 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
refer to note s and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb codification no 
 income taxes asc 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective state tax jurisdictions 
we had net operating loss carryforwards nols in fiscal years and of approximately million and million  respectively  for state tax purposes with a related valuation allowance against the nols of approximately million as of both july  and july  these net loss carryforwards expire at various intervals through as of july   we had million of charitable contribution carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  of which million expires in fiscal year and million expires in fiscal year the future charitable deduction in limited to of taxable income for each year 
based on our forecasts  we expect that we will have sufficient taxable income to use all of the charitable contributions before they expire 
therefore  we determined that no valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the charitable carryforward is required 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
recent accounting standards for information regarding recently issued accounting standards  refer to note aa and note ab to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity we have a supply agreement with parkdale america  llc parkdale to supply our yarn requirements until december  under the supply agreement  we purchase from parkdale all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations  excluding yarns that parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements  which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at july  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and december at july   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to what would have been a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at july  the impact of a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have been greater at july  than at july  due to increased commitments and higher cotton prices at july  compared to july  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options in cost of sales in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on july  or july  we are currently in negotiations to secure a new agreement to supply our yarn requirements 
we do not believe we will lose any competitive position we currently have with a new agreement 
if parkdale s operations are disrupted and it is not able to provide us with our yarn requirements  we may need to obtain yarn from alternative sources 
although alternative sources are presently available  we may not be able to enter into short term arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms with parkdale 
in addition  the cotton futures we have fixed with parkdale may not be transferable to alternative yarn suppliers 
because there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass along our higher cost of yarn to our customers  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity our us revolving credit facility provides that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at july  under the usrevolving credit facility had been outstanding during the entire year and 
table of contents the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at july  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates would have had a higher dollar impact for the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  due to the higher debt levels outstanding on july  the percentage increase is more significant for fiscal year than for fiscal year because our total interest expense for fiscal year was lower than our total interest expense for fiscal year the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 
derivatives from time to time  we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes 
see note y and note d to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our derivatives
