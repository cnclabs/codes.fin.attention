item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding our financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends that may impact our future performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
cb i is an integrated epc provider and major process technology licensor 
founded in  cb i provides conceptual design  technology  engineering  procurement  fabrication  construction and commissioning services to customers in the energy and natural resource industries 
results of operations cb i s reporting segments are comprised of our three business sectors cb i steel plate structures  cb i lummus and lummus technology 
our new awards  revenue and income from operations by reporting segment are as follows vs 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands new awards cb i steel plate structures cb i lummus lummus technology total new awards revenue cb i steel plate structures cb i lummus lummus technology total revenue income loss from operations cb i steel plate structures cb i lummus lummus technology total income from operations current market conditions we continue to have a broad diversity within the entire energy project spectrum  with more than of our revenue coming from outside the us our revenue mix will continue to evolve consistent with changes in our backlog mix  as well as shifts in future global energy demand 
we currently anticipate that investment in steel plate structures and energy processes projects will remain strong in many parts of the world 
lng investment also continues  with liquefaction projects increasing in comparison to regasification projects in certain geographies 
with respect to lummus technology  we continue to see a resurgence in petrochemical activity in developing countries and  while refining activity remains slow  we are experiencing improving conditions 
versus consolidated results new awards backlog during  new awards  representing the value of new project commitments received during a given period  were billion  compared with billion during these commitments are included in backlog until work is performed and revenue is recognized  or until cancellation 
the decrease in new awards over the comparable prior year period was primarily a result of two significant awards during for cb i lummus  a refinery in colombia in excess of billion and a gas plant in papua new guinea in excess of billion 
our new awards were distributed among our business sectors as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
our awards were distributed as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared with billion at december   as revenue exceeded new awards during the period 
as of december   more than of our backlog was for work outside the us revenue revenue for was billion  representing a million decrease from revenue decreased million for cb i steel plate structures  million for cb i lummus and million for lummus technology 
our revenue was distributed among our business sectors as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
our revenue was distributed as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
the lower revenue for was primarily due to the wind down of several projects for cb i lummus and cb i steel plate structures  which was only partially offset by activity on our large awards from the back half of as they are still in their early stages 
revenue from these large awards will increase in as construction activities increase 
see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit gross profit was million of revenue for compared with million of revenue for the increase in gross profit percentage  as compared to the comparable prior year period  primarily resulted from the prior year including a million charge for the south hook project in the uk  partly offset by a favorable project claim resolution of approximately million 
the south hook project has been completed since the first quarter of excluding the net impact of this charge  our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was higher than  primarily due to a better project mix for cb i steel plate structures and lummus technology in the current year  project claim resolutions incentives in each of our sectors and generally lower pre contract costs  partly offset by the impact of lower revenue volume and cost increases on a project in the us for cb i lummus 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for were million of revenue  compared with million of revenue for the absolute dollar decrease as compared to was primarily attributable to reductions in our global and business sector administrative support costs 
other operating income expense other operating income for was million versus expense of million for the prior year included severance costs in all of our business sectors  costs associated with the reorganization of our business sectors and costs associated with the closure of certain fabrication facilities 
the reorganization and closure costs were related to cb i lummus and cb i steel plate structures 
the prior year also included a gain on the sale of a non controlling equity investment held by cb i lummus  which partially offset the previously noted severance  reorganization and facility closure costs 
see segment results below for further discussion 
equity earnings equity earnings totaled million for  compared to million for the decrease was due to lower technology licensing and catalyst sales in joint venture investments of lummus technology  attributable to a slowdown in refining activity 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the decrease in absolute value and increase as a percentage of revenue were due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results below for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million during  compared with million during the current year benefited from the impact of lower debt balances  offset partially by million of interest expense related to the timing of tax payments resulting from our periodic us income tax compliance reviews and incremental costs during the second half of associated with the amendment and extension of our billion revolving credit facility 
interest income was million during  compared with million for the increase over was due to higher average cash balances and higher rates of return 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  compared with million of pre tax income 
the rate decreased compared to primarily because we did not recognize an income tax benefit during for losses incurred in the uk  primarily for the south hook project 
the current year rate also decreased relative to due to our us versus non us pre tax income mix 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for was million compared with million for the change compared with was commensurate with the level of applicable operating income 
segment results cb i steel plate structures new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in the comparable prior year period 
significant new awards during included lng storage tanks in asia pacific in excess of million  three storage tank awards in the middle east totaling approximately million and lng work in australia 
significant new awards during included lng and condensate storage tanks in australia approximately million  low temperature cryogenic and ambient storage tanks in the middle east approximately million  a crude oil terminal expansion project in panama approximately million and an lng expansion project in the us approximately million 
revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with the decrease was primarily due to the wind down of two large tank projects in australia and reduced oil sands related work in canada  partly offset by a greater volume of petroleum storage tank work in central america and revenue from our large third quarter storage tank awards in the middle east and australia 
we anticipate higher sector revenue from these awards in as construction activities continue to increase 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue during the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately million of severance  reorganization and facility closure costs 
the current year did not experience such costs and benefited from a better project mix  a claim settlement in the us  and lower pre contract costs  partly offset by the impact of lower revenue volume 
cb i lummus new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in significant new awards during included incremental releases for an oil sands project in canada approximately million  a gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering services for a floating production  storage and offloading facility in europe approximately million  a gas processing plant in peru approximately million  development services for an lng integrated project in russia  and scope increases on our existing projects  particularly in papua new guinea and colombia 
awards during included a refinery in colombia in excess of billion and a gas plant in papua new guinea in excess of billion 
revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with our results were impacted by a lower volume of lng work in south america and europe and less refinery work in the us and europe  partly offset by a higher volume of oil sands related work in canada and revenue from our large fourth quarter refinery and gas plant awards in colombia and papua new guinea  respectively 
we anticipate higher sector revenue from these awards in as construction activities continue to increase 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue during our results included charges of million on the south hook project  which was completed in the first quarter of  offset partially by a favorable project claim resolution of approximately million 
our results were also impacted by approximately million of severance  reorganization and facility closure costs  net of a gain on the sale of a non controlling equity investment 
relative to the comparable period  excluding the impact of the net charges noted above  the current year experienced a lower margin project mix and cost increases on a project in the us  partly offset by project incentives earned on a project in asia pacific and lower pre contract and selling and administrative costs 
lummus technology new awards backlog during  new awards were million  compared with million in the comparable prior year period 
significant new awards during included awards for the license and engineering design of a propane dehydrogenation unit in china  engineering and heater technology for an ethylene expansion project in the us and an ethylene cracking heater award in russia 
the increase over the comparable prior year period is attributable to increased heat transfer equipment orders as well as greater opportunities in the petrochemicals markets 
the award activity for has primarily been located in asia pacific  the middle east  the us and russia 
significant new awards included an ethylene cracking heaters award in taiwan approximately million 
revenue revenue was million for  representing a million decrease  compared with our period benefited from a higher heater supply backlog going into the year  while has been impacted by lower beginning of the year heater supply backlog 
the decrease for was partially offset by higher licensing revenue attributable to an increase in petrochemical award activity 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue during our results were positively impacted by a greater ratio of higher margin licensing technology revenue compared to heat transfer revenue  a favorable project claim resolution  and lower selling and administrative costs  partly offset by lower equity earnings 
we experienced lower equity earnings from joint venture investments in due to lower technology licensing and catalyst sales which are attributable to a slowdown in refining activity 
our results were also impacted by severance costs totaling million 
versus consolidated results new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion during the increase in new awards over the comparable prior year period was primarily a result of two significant awards during for cb i lummus a refinery award in colombia in excess of billion and a gas plant in papua new guinea in excess of billion 
our new awards were distributed among our business sectors as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
our awards were distributed as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared with billion at december   representing a billion increase  which is primarily a result of the significant awards noted above 
revenue revenue for was billion  decreasing billion from revenue decreased million for cb i steel plate structures  million for cb i lummus and million for lummus technology 
our revenue was distributed among our business sectors as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
our revenue was distributed as follows cb i steel plate structures billion  cb i lummus billion and lummus technology million 
see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit gross profit was million of revenue for compared with million of revenue for during  cb i lummus recognized a million charge associated with the south hook and isle of grain ii projects in the uk the uk projects 
although reflected a million charge for the south hook project  the year benefited from a favorable claim settlement for cb i lummus and a favorable project gross profit mix across all business sectors  offset partially by higher pre contract costs and the impact of lower revenue volume 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expense for was million of revenue  compared with million of revenue for the absolute dollar decrease as compared to was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in our global and business sector administrative support costs  partly offset by higher incentive program costs in other operating expense income other operating expense for was million versus income of million in included in were severance costs in all business sectors  costs associated with the reorganization of our business sectors and costs associated with the closure of certain fabrication facilities 
the reorganization and closure costs were related to cb i lummus and cb i steel plate structures 
these costs were partly offset by a gain on the sale of a non controlling equity investment held by cb i lummus 
equity earnings equity earnings totaled million for  compared to million for the decrease was due primarily to including higher technology licensing and catalyst sales for various proprietary technologies in joint venture investments of lummus technology 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus income from operations of million of revenue for the increase was due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results below for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million during  compared with million during the higher expense reflects the full year impact of higher costs resulting from the amendment of our credit facilities in the second half of  offset partially by a lower debt balance 
interest income was million for  compared with million for the decrease was due to lower average cash balances and lower rates of return 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  versus income tax expense of million of pre tax income for our income tax rate was impacted by the aforementioned charges on the uk projects  for which we did not provide an income tax benefit for their net losses in the third and fourth quarters of our income tax rate also reflects the impact of project losses in the uk  where we have not provided an associated income tax benefit  partially offset by the income tax benefit of previously unrecognized net operating losses utilized during the current year in other jurisdictions  primarily the netherlands 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for was million compared with million for the change compared with was commensurate with the level of applicable operating income 
segment results cb i steel plate structures new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in the comparable prior year period 
significant new awards during included low temperature cryogenic and ambient storage tanks in the middle east approximately million  lng and condensate storage tanks in australia approximately million  a crude oil terminal expansion project in panama approximately million and an lng expansion project in the us approximately million 
significant new awards during included an oil sands storage terminal and lng peak shaving facility in canada approximately million and million  respectively  two nuclear containment vessels in the us approximately million  an expansion project in australia  and additional tanks at an lng import terminal in china 
revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with the decrease was primarily due to the timing of awards  which largely occurred during the back half of the year  reduced oil sands related work in canada  reduced activity in the us and the wind down of a large project in australia 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue for our project gross profit mix was comparable between and  however  our results were impacted by lower revenue volume and higher pre contract costs 
additionally  was negatively impacted by severance  reorganization and facility closure costs totaling approximately million 
cb i lummus new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion in significant new awards for included a refinery in colombia in excess of billion and a gas plant in papua new guinea in excess of billion 
additionally  during and  we were awarded various energy processes awards throughout the world 
revenue revenue was billion during  representing a decrease of million  compared with our results were impacted by a lower volume of lng terminal work in the us  europe and south america  partially offset by higher revenue for refinery work in south america and europe 
income loss from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus a loss from operations of million of revenue during included in our results was a million charge for the uk projects 
although our results included a million charge for the south hook project and included severance  reorganization and facility closure costs  higher pre contract costs  and was impacted by lower revenue volume  the year benefited from a favorable project gross profit mix and a favorable claim settlement 
severance  reorganization and facility closure costs  net of a gain on the sale of a non controlling equity investment  totaled approximately million in the charges for the south hook project in  and to a lesser extent in  reflected projected cost increases resulting from significant weather delays and poor labor productivity and subcontractor performance  which extended our schedule for completion beyond our previous estimates 
additionally  as we approached progress completion  we were unable to achieve the rate of labor reduction anticipated in our estimates  absenteeism  intermittent labor walkouts and labor strike activity were significant  and this impacted the scheduling of work and increased inefficiencies  which further impacted productivity and costs  and we transferred control of the site to the project owner in  which required a more stringent permit to work process that was also controlled by the owner  resulting in delays to our work processes and increased costs 
the south hook project was essentially complete as of december  lummus technology new awards backlog during  new awards were million  compared with million in the comparable prior year period 
our most significant new award was for ethylene cracking heaters in china approximately million 
during  significant awards included heat transfer equipment for a petrochemical complex in the middle east approximately million  and a licensing and engineering award for a petrochemical complex in india 
revenue revenue was million for  representing a decrease of million  compared with our results were impacted by a lower opening backlog entering into than and fewer licensing and heater supply awards  reflecting the uncertainty in the markets in late and early income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  versus million of revenue for our results were impacted by lower revenue volume  lower equity earnings due to fewer joint venture licensing awards  and severance costs totaling approximately million  offset partially by a favorable project gross profit mix and lower research and development and selling and administrative costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
operating during  cash flows from operations totaled million  as cash generated from our earnings was partly offset by an overall increase in working capital levels 
the increase in working capital was the result of a decrease in accounts payable million and an increase in net contracts in progress million in all three of our sectors  largely offset by a decrease in accounts receivable million  primarily for cb i lummus due to receivable collections on major projects 
investing during  net cash used in investing activities totaled million 
net cash outflows associated with acquisitions during the period totaled million  including approximately million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of cr l and million for various other lummus technology investments 
additionally  capital expenditures for totaled million 
these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment during the period totaling approximately million 
for  capital expenditures are anticipated to be in the range of to million 
we continue to evaluate and selectively pursue opportunities for additional expansion of our business through acquisition of complementary businesses 
these acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or may require further debt or equity financing 
financing during  net cash flows used in financing activities totaled million  primarily resulting from the purchase of million of stock under our share repurchase program million shares at an average price of per share and a fourth quarter million installment payment on our term loan see below 
additional cash used in financing activities was related to fees associated with the amendment and extension of our billion revolving credit facility and distributions to our non controlling interest partners  both of which are included within revolving facility costs and other 
our cash outflows were partially offset by million of cash proceeds from the issuance of shares associated with our stock plans and million of tax benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation costs 
effect of exchange rate changes on cash during  our cash balance increased by million due to the impact of changes in functional currency exchange rates against the us dollar on us dollar cash balances 
the unrealized gain on our cash balance resulting from this exchange rate movement is reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income loss 
our cash held in non us dollar currencies is used primarily for project related and other operating expenditures in those currencies  and therefore  our exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is not anticipated to be material 
letters of credit bank guarantees debt surety bonds our primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
capacity under a revolving credit facility is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
we have a four year  billion  committed and unsecured revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na bofa  as syndication agent  which was amended effective july  the revolving facility 
the amendment extended the revolving facility s term through july   and maintained the billion of capacity and million borrowing sublimit under the previous facility 
additionally  the revolving facility maintained financial covenants similar to those of the previous facility  such as a maximum leverage ratio of  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of and a minimum net worth level calculated as million at december  the revolving facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness  sales of assets  liens  investments  type of business conducted and mergers and acquisitions  among other restrictions 
no direct borrowings were outstanding under the revolving facility as of december   however  we had issued million of letters of credit 
such letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees  in lieu of retention on our contracts  or in certain cases  are issued in support of our insurance program 
as of december   we had million of available capacity under the revolving facility 
in addition to the revolving facility  we have three committed and unsecured letter of credit and term loan agreements the lc agreements with bofa  as administrative agent  jpmorgan  and various private placement note investors 
under the terms of the lc agreements  either bofa or jpmorgan the lc issuers can issue letters of credit 
in the aggregate  they provide up to million of capacity 
as of december   no direct borrowings were outstanding under the lc agreements  but all three tranches were fully utilized 
tranche a  a million facility  and tranche b  a million facility  are both five year facilities which expire in november tranche c is an eight year  million facility expiring in november the lc agreements have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the revolving facility 
in the event of our default under the lc agreements  including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit  the lc issuers could transfer their claim against us  to the extent such amount is due and payable by us under the lc agreements  to the private placement lenders  creating a term loan that is due and payable no later than the stated maturity of the respective lc agreement 
in addition to quarterly letter of credit fees that we pay under the lc agreements  we would be assessed an applicable rate of interest over libor to the extent that a term loan is in effect 
additionally  we have million remaining on our unsecured term loan the term loan with jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bofa  as syndication agent 
interest under the term loan is paid quarterly in arrears and  at our election  is based upon libor plus an applicable floating margin 
however  we have an interest rate swap that provides for an interest rate of approximately  inclusive of the applicable floating margin 
the term loan is scheduled to be repaid in equal installments of million per year  with the last principal payment due in november the term loan has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the revolving facility 
we also have various short term  uncommitted revolving credit facilities the uncommitted facilities across several geographic regions of approximately billion 
these facilities are generally used to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees to customers to support advance payments and performance guarantees in the ordinary course of business or in lieu of retention on our contracts 
at december   we had available capacity of million under these facilities 
in addition to providing letters of credit or bank guarantees  we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants and financial covenants  with a leverage ratio of  a fixed charge coverage ratio of  and net worth of billion 
our ability to remain in compliance with such lending facilities could be impacted by circumstances or conditions beyond our control  including but not limited to the delay or cancellation of projects  changes in currency exchange or interest rates  performance of pension plan assets  or changes in actuarial assumptions 
further  we could be impacted if our customers experience a material change in their ability to pay us or if the banks associated with our lending facilities were to cease or reduce operations 
for a further discussion of letters of credit and surety bonds  as well as the term loan  see notes and to our financial statements 
sales agency agreement we have a sales agency agreement with calyon  pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time  with calyon as our sales agent  up to million shares of our common stock 
during  no shares were sold under the sales agency agreement 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases term loan self insurance obligations pension funding obligations postretirement benefit funding obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations as noted above  we have an interest rate swap that provides for an interest rate of approximately on our term loan 
the term loan obligation includes interest accruing at this fixed rate 
amount represents expected payments associated with our self insurance program 
payments beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable on a year by year basis 
amounts represent expected contributions to fund our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
contributions beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments to satisfy our requirements for materials and supplies for contracts that have been awarded 
these purchase commitments which are expected to be recovered from our customers are generally settled in less than one year 
we do not enter into long term purchase commitments on a speculative basis for fixed or minimum quantities 
payments for reserved tax contingencies of million are not included as the timing of specific tax payments is not determinable 
other we believe that our cash on hand  funds generated by operations  amounts available under our existing revolving facility  lc agreements and uncommitted facilities  and other external sources of liquidity  such as the issuance of debt and equity instruments  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures  settle our commitments and contingencies as more fully described in note to our financial statements and address our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funding will be available  as our ability to generate cash flows from operations and our ability to access funding under our revolving facility  lc agreements and uncommitted facilities at current prices may be impacted by a variety of business  economic  legislative  financial and other factors  which may be outside of our control 
additionally  while we currently have significant uncommitted bonding facilities  primarily to support various commercial provisions in our contracts  a termination or reduction of these bonding facilities could result in the utilization of letters of credit in lieu of performance bonds  thereby reducing our available capacity under the revolving facility and lc agreements 
although we do not anticipate a reduction or termination of the bonding facilities  there can be no assurance that such facilities will be available at reasonable terms to service our ordinary course obligations 
we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business and we have in place appropriate insurance coverage for the type of work that we have performed 
as a matter of standard policy  we review our litigation accrual quarterly and as further information is known on pending cases  increases or decreases  as appropriate  may be recorded 
for a discussion of pending litigation  including lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed  see note to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we use operating leases for facilities and equipment when they make economic sense  including sale leaseback arrangements 
we have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting standards for a discussion of new accounting standards  see the applicable section in note to our financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our supervisory board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition our contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including fixed price  cost reimbursable and hybrid approaches 
we follow the guidance in the fasb s asc revenue recognition topic for accounting policies relating to our use of the poc method  estimating costs and revenue recognition  including the recognition of profit incentives  unapproved change orders and claims  and combining and segmenting contracts 
our contract revenue is primarily recognized using the poc method  based on the percentage that actual costs to date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract 
we utilize this cost to cost approach  the most widely recognized method used for poc accounting  as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress 
under the cost to cost approach  the use of estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including  to the extent required  the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods 
due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated minimum recoveries of unapproved change orders and claims 
we recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent that related costs have been incurred  recovery is probable and the value can be reliably estimated 
for and  we had no material unapproved change orders or claims recognized in revenue 
for  we had projects with unapproved change orders or claims of approximately million factored into the determination of their revenue and estimated costs 
losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to earnings in the period such losses become known 
net losses recognized during  and for active projects in a loss position totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
credit extension we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business only after a review of the potential customer s creditworthiness 
additionally  management reviews the commercial terms of all significant contracts before entering into a contractual arrangement 
we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to and likelihood of making required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties changes  circumstances develop  or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
financial instruments we utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as described below foreign currency exchange rate derivatives we do not engage in currency speculation  however  we do utilize foreign currency derivatives on an on going basis to mitigate certain foreign currency related operating exposures and to hedge intercompany loans utilized to finance our non us subsidiaries 
we generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses exclusive of credit risk and forward points which represent the time value component of the fair value of our derivative positions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings 
changes in the fair value of credit risk and forward points  gains and losses associated with instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges  including those instruments used to hedge intercompany loans  are recognized within cost of revenue 
interest rate derivatives our interest rate derivatives are limited to a swap arrangement in place to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our term loan 
the swap arrangement is designated as a cash flow hedge  as its critical terms matched those of the term loan at inception and as of december  therefore  changes in the fair value of the hedge are included in aoci 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the final realization of deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions 
we have not provided a valuation allowance against approximately million of our net uk deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset will be utilized from future earnings and contracting strategies 
during  the uk deferred tax asset decreased by million 
we provide income tax reserves in situations where we have and have not received tax assessments 
tax reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide 
as a matter of standard policy  we continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur  increases or decreases  as appropriate  may be recorded 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we retain a portion of anticipated losses through the use of deductibles and self insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers compensation 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims through analysis of historical and projected trends  in conjunction with actuaries and other consultants  and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a hypothetical ten percent change in our self insurance reserves at december  would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately million for recoverability of goodwill and finite lived intangible assets goodwill is not amortized to earnings  but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually via a two phase process  absent any indicators of impairment 
our goodwill impairment analysis requires us to allocate goodwill to our reporting units  compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill  and then  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the primary method we employ to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit is the discounted cash flow method 
this methodology is based  to a large extent  on assumptions about future events  which may or may not occur as anticipated  and such deviations could have a significant impact on the estimated fair values calculated 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  estimates of future growth rates  discount rates and terminal values of reporting units 
our goodwill balance at december  was million 
based upon our current strategic planning and associated goodwill impairment assessments  there are currently no indicators of impairment for any of our reporting units 
we review tangible assets and finite lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists 
finite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years  absent any indicators of impairment 
for further discussion regarding goodwill and other intangibles  see note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one form of exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency  which are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in aoci
