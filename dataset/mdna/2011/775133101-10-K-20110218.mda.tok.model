business overview company background and strategy we are a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer electronics  mass transit  automotive  defense and clean technology 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
our ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions 
it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on sales and earnings 
strategically  our current focus is on three mega trends that we believe will fuel the future growth of our company growth of the internet  expansion of mass transit  and further investment in clean technology 
these trends and their related markets all require materials that perform to the highest standards  which has been a key strength of our products over the years 
we are also focused on growing our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions or technology investments that will add to or expand our product portfolio  as well as strengthen our presence in existing markets or expand into new ones 
we will continue to focus on business opportunities and invest in expansion around the globe 
in the first quarter of  we will begin to report results of our acquisition of curamik electronics gmbh curamik  production will begin at our new printed circuit materials facility in suzhou  china and we plan to begin manufacturing our power distribution systems products in north america in the second half of when these events occur  these two businesses will have a manufacturing presence in our three primary geographic regions north america  europe and asia further solidifying our commitment to be close to our customers in order to better serve their needs 
our ultimate goal is to become the supplier of choice for our customers in all of the various markets in which we participate 
to achieve this goal  we strive to make the best products in these respective markets and to deliver the highest level of service to our customers 
executive summary overall  was a very strong recovery year for rogers 
we entered the year with cautious optimism  as business was beginning to improve from the recessionary levels that severely impacted our results in there was  and still remains  much uncertainty in the global economic environment and knowing how it will impact our business 
throughout  we achieved strong financial results  with third quarter sales eclipsing the million level the first time our quarterly sales volumes reached that milestone since early our core businesses  high performance foams  printed circuit materials  and power distribution systems  all achieved very strong results both from a sales and volume perspective 
overall  our sales increased by from million in to million in we also achieved strong profitability results as we achieved of earnings per diluted share as compared to a loss of per share in results included approximately million in one time charges and impairments  in addition to an approximately million deferred tax valuation allowance charge 
during the early stages of the economic crisis  our management team took quick action to protect our business and minimize the long term impact of the recession 
we reduced our overhead costs  scaled back production levels  and closely managed our working capital requirements 
this enabled us to continue to operate our business with cash generated from operations  as we did not have to borrow money to meet our financial obligations 
it also allowed us to maintain a strong financial position with a current asset to current liability ratio of over to and a strong cash position 
during this period  the time needed to collect our cash from outstanding receivables actually improved 
all of these actions formed the base that allowed us to take advantage of the economic recovery once it began in the latter half of our internal performance improved and sales volumes and profitability levels increased  while we still maintained our cost controls and closely managed our working capital 
this also enabled us to pursue our strategy of growth by acquisition  whether that be acquiring businesses  investing in new technology  or by expanding our existing products into current or new markets 
in the first half of  we acquired sk utis co  ltd utis  a manufacturer of polyurethane foams located in south korea  which was integrated into our high performance foams business during the year 
on december   we signed an agreement to acquire curamik  a manufacturer of ceramic power electronic substrates headquartered in eschenbach  germany 
this transaction closed in early curamik adds another core strategic business to our portfolio and expands our reach into a new market with new products 
management believes that this acquisition  along with core legacy businesses  forms a strong platform for growth in the future 
however  our optimism is continuously tempered by the uncertainty that continues to exist in the global economic environment 
segment realignment in the second quarter of  we realigned how we manage our business and therefore our segment reporting structure 
our previous reporting structure was comprised of four reportable segments high performance foams  printed circuit materials  custom electrical components and other polymer products 
our new reporting structure is comprised of three major categories of businesses core strategic  development stage  and other 
the core strategic category includes our three major operating segments high performance foams  printed circuit materials  and power distribution systems 
the development stage category contains two operating segments printed and electronic solutions formerly our durel operating segment that was reported in the custom electrical components reportable segment and thermal management solutions formerly reported in the other polymer products reportable segment 
this category represents our start up and new business development initiatives 
lastly  the other segment is an aggregate of our remaining operating segments elastomer components  polyimide laminate systems and composite materials 
we believe this structure reflects how our management team currently views and manages our business and it clearly presents our business operations 
as a result of our acquisition of curamik  we are reviewing our segment structure and will make any necessary changes in the first quarter of in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales gross margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income loss equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income  net net investment losses interest income  net acquisition disposal gain income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  an increase of from million of sales in the increase in sales is attributable to increases in our core strategic segments  most notably our high performance foams segment  which increased by year over year  and our printed circuit materials segment  which increased by 
a primary driver of these increases was the strong demand for the industry leading products and materials produced by these segments  particularly as the global economy began to recover from the recessionary environment that existed in  which had a significant negative impact on our overall business 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased by approximately basis points to in from in margins increased at all of our segments  with the most significant increases occurring in our high performance foams and power distribution systems segments with year over year percentage increases of and  respectively  in as compared to margins in were significantly impacted by the volume declines experienced during the year  particularly in the first half of the year as margins in the first quarter of our low point for sales were approximately 
during  sales volume increases  as well as our cost cutting initiatives that began early in  helped to drive the significant margin improvements 
our margins will continue to be driven to a large extent by both our volume levels  product mix  and overall cost structure 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with various incentive compensation plans  including the annual bonus plan  equity compensation plans that include stock options and restricted stock  and sales commissions programs  which all increased as a result of our strong operational performance in as compared to the increase in costs can also be attributed to elevated spending levels necessary to support our higher sales levels achieved in versus results included approximately million of costs associated with the acquisitions of utis in the second quarter of and curamik  which closed early in the first quarter of  along with a gain of million from the proceeds received from the settlement of a previously filed suit against fireman s fund insurance company related to the calamp lawsuit in results included approximately million of one time costs related to a product liability claim on our printed circuit material products and million of costs associated with the integration of mti global  inc operations  as well as approximately million of incremental costs related to our deferred benefit pension plan as a result of the decline in asset value during overall  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses remained consistent year over year  at and for and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses remained in line with expectations at for and in this increase was due in part to the timing of expenditures 
our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development 
however  in a period of rising sales  research and development expenditures do not increase at the pace of sales  and therefore  there is often a delay in meeting our targeted investment level  thus the decline in going forward  we will continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
with our acquisition of curamik  we will reevaluate our targeted long term spending rate and adjust our spending targets  if necessary  in the future 
restructuring and impairment charges during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges of which million was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
the restructuring and impairment charges were comprised of the following million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets in the following operating segments flexible circuit materials million  printed and electronic solutions million  printed circuit materials million  thermal management solutions million and high performance foams million  million in severance related to a global workforce reduction  and million in charges related to additional inventory reserves related to the restructuring of our printed and electronic solutions and flexible circuit materials operating segments  which was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges are discussed in greater detail below 
flexible circuit materials in the second quarter of as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would exit the flexible circuit materials market and effectively discontinue any new product development or research in this area 
over the previous several years  the flexible circuit materials market had experienced increased commoditization of its products  resulting in increased competition and extreme pricing pressures 
in  we had taken certain initial actions to streamline our flexible circuit materials business  including shifting production of certain products to our joint venture in taiwan  and retaining only certain  higher margin products 
however  in  we determined that the future markets for these products were very limited and did not fit with the strategic direction of the company 
therefore  we determined that we would immediately stop production of certain remaining flexible circuit materials products and continue to support only select customers for a limited time period going forward  ultimately resulting in the abandonment of our wholly owned flexible circuit materials business 
as a result of these management decisions  we determined it appropriate to evaluate the assets related to this business for potential impairment 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge related to specific equipment located in our belgian facility 
this equipment was to be used primarily for the development of certain flexible circuit materials related products  however  based on the decision to abandon the business  this equipment was no longer of use to us 
we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million related to this equipment and wrote it down to an estimated salvage value of approximately million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also recorded an impairment charge on a building located in suzhou  china that was built to support our flexible circuit materials business in the asian marketplace 
we are currently marketing this building for sale and have classified it as an asset held for sale and recorded an impairment charge in of approximately million to reflect the current fair market value of the building less costs to sell 
the remaining asset value of million is classified as an asset held for sale in the current asset section of our consolidated statements of financial position 
the impairment charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
further  as part of the decision to exit the flexible circuit materials business  we recorded additional reserves on certain inventory that will no longer be sold  of approximately million 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
lastly  we also recorded an impairment charge in on certain other assets pertaining to the flexible circuit materials business in asia of approximately million  which was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our other reportable segment 
high performance foams during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our manufacturing facility located in richmond  virginia which was acquired as part of the acquisition of certain assets of mti global inc the building was classified as an asset held for sale when acquired in the second quarter of market conditions at the time resulted in the fourth quarter impairment charge 
this charge was recorded in our high performance foams operating segment 
printed and electronic solutions over the past few years  our printed and electronic solutions pes electroluminescent el lamp business has steadily declined as new technologies have emerged to replace these lamps in cell phone and other related applications 
in the second quarter of  we took initial steps to restructure the pes business for this decline  as we shifted the majority of manufacturing to our china facility and recorded impairment charges on certain us based assets 
since that time  we have continued to produce el lamps out of our china facility at gradually declining volumes and our management team has initiated efforts to develop new product applications using our screen printing technology 
our initial forecasts indicated the potential for new applications to go to market in the second half of  however  we had not successfully developed any new applications that would generate material cash flows in the future 
we concluded that this situation  plus the fact that our el lamp production was primarily limited to automotive applications as there were no longer material sales into the handheld market as of the second quarter of  was an indicator of impairment 
the resulting analysis concluded that these assets should be treated as abandoned  as they are not in use and we did not anticipate the assets being placed in use in the near future 
as such  these assets were written down to their current fair value  which in this case approximates salvage value as there is not a readily available market for these assets since the technology is becoming obsolete 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to these assets  resulting in a remaining book value of approximately million 
this charge is reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
further  as a result of reaching end of life on certain handheld applications  we recorded additional inventory reserves of approximately million  as this inventory no longer had any value or future use 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the continued decline in the pes business  as described above  we made the decision to market for sale the pes facility located in chandler  arizona 
as a result of this decision  the fair value of the building was appraised at approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
the building does not meet the definition of an asset held for sale  per the relevant accounting guidance  and therefore it will continue to be classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated statement of financial position at december  these charges were reported in our printed and electronic solutions operating segment 
printed circuit materials early in  management determined based on forecasts at that time  that we would need additional capacity for our high frequency products later that year 
management had already undertaken initiatives to build additional capacity through a new facility on our china campus  but needed a solution to fill interim capacity needs 
therefore  we initiated efforts to move idle equipment from our belgian facility to our arizona facility and incurred costs of approximately million due to these efforts 
at the end of  our overall business began to decline due in part to the global recession  and management determined that we would not need this equipment at that time but that we would still need certain capacity later in prior to the china capacity coming on line 
however  in  business did not recover as quickly as anticipated and we believed that we would not need this equipment as we had sufficient capacity to meet our current needs and the china facility would be available in time to satisfy any increase in demand 
therefore  we determined that the costs incurred related to the relocation of this equipment should be impaired and equipment purchased or refurbished as part of the relocation should be written down to an estimated salvage value  resulting in a charge of approximately million  which is reflected in the restructuring and impairment line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our printed circuit materials operating segment 
thermal management solutions in the second quarter of  as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would abandon the development of certain products related to our thermal management systems start up business  specifically products related to our thermal interface material tim 
we had not been successful in developing this product and were not confident in its future market potential  therefore  we chose to abandon its development to focus solely on the development of aluminum silicon carbide products  which we believe have a stronger market potential 
this decision resulted in a charge of approximately million from the impairment of certain assets related to tim production 
this charge is reflected in the restructuring and impairment line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our thermal management solutions operating segment 
severance in the first half of  we announced certain cost reduction initiatives that included a workforce reduction and a significant reduction in our operating and overhead expenses in an effort to better align our cost structure with the lower sales volumes experienced at the end of and in as a result  we recognized approximately million in severance charges in  and paid out approximately million in severance during a summary of the activity in the severance accrual as of december  is as follows dollars in thousands balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  these charges were included in the restructuring and impairment charges line item on our consolidated statements of operations and were reported across all segments 
we did not record any restructuring or impairment charges during equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures increased million from million in to million in the year over year increase is primarily attributable to the strong performance of our foam joint ventures  rogers inoac suzhou ris in china and rogers inoac corporation ric in japan  as business rebounded significantly from the recession driven declines and excess inventory levels experienced in during  we sold our interest in rcct to our partner  chang chun plastics  ltd 
in the fourth quarter of  effectively completing our exit of the flexible circuit materials business 
prior to the sale of our interest  rcct was slightly accretive to our results in other income expense  net other income increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily due to the the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program  which collectively contributed approximately million in unfavorable net adjustments in  compared to million in favorable net adjustments in the foreign currency fluctuations were offset by the pls commission activity for each year 
we dissolved the pls joint venture in the first quarter of  resulting in only million in commission income for  compared to million in net impairment loss net impairment loss is the portion of the auction rate security impairment that relates to credit losses 
the amount increased in from a loss of million to a loss of million 
the change is attributable to market conditions surrounding the underlying securities of the auction rate securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  and in in  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of a portion of the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we developed a tax planning strategy that would allow us to recognize certain deferred tax assets  resulting in a partial reduction of our valuation allowance 
we believe that this strategy is reasonable  prudent  and feasible  and we will implement this strategy  if need be  to ensure that this portion of our deferred tax asset will not expire 
in both and  we were in a cumulative three year loss position in the us as the realization of deferred taxes is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment  we concluded that given the weight of both positive and negative evidence  a valuation allowance should be placed against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets  for which there is neither a tax planning strategy nor source of taxable income against which it would offset 
in  our effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by recording a valuation allowance charge of million against our us deferred tax asset 
also  in both and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity 
we continue to be eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years that gradually increases to the full rate of tax in in  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of 
in  rsz reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
the tax rate in effect in will be  and will increase to the full rate of in under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  also a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  rsh was subject to a reduced rate of tax that gradually increases to the full rate of tax in in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
in  rsh reported pretax income of million which was subject to a tax rate of 
the tax rate in effect in will be  and will increase to the full rate of in backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the printed circuit materials and power distribution systems operating segments 
backlog for printed circuit materials increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end  while backlog for power distribution systems increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales was attributable to declines in all of our segments  most notably our printed and electronic solutions segment  which declined by year over year  our high performance foams segment  which declined by  and our printed circuit materials reportable segment  which declined as compared to the prior year 
a primary driver of these declines was the global economic recession that severely impacted our volumes in  particularly in the first half of the year 
additional factors impacting these results are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased by approximately basis points to in from in margins decreased in all three of our segments  with the most significant declines occurring in our printed electronic solutions and high performance foams segments with declines of and  respectively  in as compared to these margins were significantly impacted by the volume declines experienced during the year  particularly in the beginning of the year as margins in the first quarter our low point for sales were approximately 
as the year progressed  volumes increased and our cost cutting efforts  which were initiated in the first and second quarters of  began to take effect  which resulted in sequential margin improvement  as evidenced by fourth quarter margins of  which were more comparable to levels achieved during  albeit on lower average volumes 
our margins will continue to be driven to a large extent by both our volume levels and product mix 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million from million in expenses declined  partially as a result of the cost cutting measures initiated during the first quarter of as a result of the global economic recession 
results included approximately million of one time costs related to a product liability claim on our printed circuit material products and million of costs associated with the integration of mti global operations  as well as approximately million of incremental costs related to our deferred benefit pension plan as a result of the decline in asset value during results included a one time charge of approximately million related to the settlement of and legal fees for our lawsuit with calamp see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion  as well as incentive compensation expense of approximately million 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased in to from in  primarily as a result of the significant decline in sales experienced in as compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by from million in to million in this decline was due in part to the timing of expenditures  as well as overall cost reductions as part of the cost reduction program initiated in the first half of as a percentage of sales  expenses remained consistent at for and in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges during  we recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges of which million was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
the restructuring and impairment charges were comprised of the following million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets in the following operating segments flexible circuit materials million  printed and electronic solutions million  printed circuit materials million  thermal management solutions million and high performance foams million  million in severance related to a global workforce reduction  and million in charges related to additional inventory reserves related to the restructuring of our printed and electronic solutions and flexible circuit materials operating segments  which was recorded in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations

we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million related to this equipment and wrote it down to an estimated salvage value of approximately million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also recorded an impairment charge on a building located in suzhou  china that was built to support our flexible circuit materials business in the asian marketplace 
we are currently marketing this building for sale and have classified it as an asset held for sale and recorded an impairment charge in of approximately million to reflect the current fair market value of the building less costs to sell 
the remaining asset value of million is classified as an asset held for sale in the current asset section of our consolidated statements of financial position 
the impairment charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
further  as part of the decision to exit the flexible circuit materials business  we recorded additional reserves on certain inventory that will no longer be sold  of approximately million 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
lastly  we also recorded an impairment charge in on certain other assets pertaining to the flexible circuit materials business in asia of approximately million  which was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our other reportable segment 
high performance foams during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our manufacturing facility located in richmond  virginia which was acquired as part of the acquisition of certain assets of mti inc the building was classified as an asset held for sale when acquired in the second quarter of market conditions at the time resulted in the fourth quarter impairment charge 
this charge was recorded in our high performance foams operating segment 
printed and electronic solutions over the past few years  our printed and electronic solutions pes electroluminescent el lamp business has steadily declined as new technologies have emerged to replace these lamps in cell phone and other related applications

further  as a result of reaching end of life on certain handheld applications  we recorded additional inventory reserves of approximately million  as this inventory no longer had any value or future use 
this charge was reported as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the continued decline in the pes business  as described above  we made the decision to market for sale the pes facility located in chandler  arizona 
as a result of this decision  the fair value of the building was appraised at approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this charge was reported in the restructuring and impairment line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
the building does not meet the definition of an asset held for sale  per the relevant accounting guidance  and therefore it continues to be classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated statement of financial position at december  these charges were reported in our printed and electronic solutions operating segment

thermal management solutions in the second quarter of  as part of our strategic planning process  our management team determined that we would abandon the development of certain products related to our thermal management systems start up business  specifically products related to our thermal interface material tim 
we had not been successful in developing this product and were not confident in its future market potential  therefore  we chose to abandon its development to focus solely on the development of aluminum silicon carbide products  which we believe have a stronger market potential 
this decision resulted in a charge of approximately million from the impairment of certain assets related to tim production 
this charge is reflected in the restructuring and impairment line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
these charges were reported in our thermal management solutions operating segment 
severance in the first half of  we announced certain cost reduction initiatives that included a workforce reduction and a significant reduction in our operating and overhead expenses in an effort to better align our cost structure with the lower sales volumes experienced at the end of and in as a result  we recognized approximately million in severance charges in  and paid out approximately million in severance during a summary of the activity in the severance accrual as of december  is as follows balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  these charges were included in the restructuring and impairment charges line item on our consolidated statements of operations and were reported across all segments 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily driven by the continued decline of our flexible circuits joint venture in taiwan  rogers chang chun technology  co  combined with the decline experienced in our polyurethane foam joint venture with inoac corporation in china  which experienced weakened demand  due primarily to the impact of the global recession  as well as excess inventory in the supply chain  particularly in the first half of the year 
sales improved in the third and fourth quarters  particularly at ris  primarily due to the improvement in the chinese economy in the second half of other income other income decreased from million in to million in the decrease is due in part to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and our related hedging program that was implemented in  which collectively contributed approximately million in unfavorable net adjustments in  compared to million in favorable adjustments in  as well as a decrease in in commission income of million related to our pls joint venture

in particular  our industry leading products for cushioning  sealing and protecting sensitive components in mobile internet devices were in high demand  specifically in large touch screen display tablets 
additionally  sales of products that meet stringent industry standards in the mass transit market  particularly seating and sealing applications  were strong during as compared to in  sales levels reached their lowest point in the first half of the year during the peak of the recession 
during the second half of  we began to experience a turnaround in the market as our sales and operating results began to improve 
this trend continued in as markets continued to improve  resulting in increasing sales volumes and profits during the year 
vs 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to in  hpf was impacted significantly by the recession  particularly in the first half of the year  as weakened consumer spending and supply chain inventory issues negatively impacted revenues across all end markets 
cell phone applications in particular experienced significant declines as manufacturers had excess inventory in the supply chain 
however  as the year progressed  sales into the portable handset applications and consumer electronics market  improved as the supply chain inventory corrections were completed and order rates increased 
in the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of certain assets of the silicone foam business of mti global  inc  which was accretive to our sales volumes over the second half of the year 
in the second half of  we experienced sales volume increases as compared to the first half of the year  particularly in cell phone and consumer electronics markets 
additionally  orders improved for our silicone foam materials into the mass transit and general industrial markets  in part due to the mti acquisition 
results include approximately million of one time integration costs related to this purchase  as well as million in severance charges related to both the acquisition  as well as the worldwide workforce reduction announced in the first half of the year

the overall improvement in the business from to was driven by the continued strong demand for the segment s materials into the wireless infrastructure market as the pace of third generation g and fourth generation g systems deployments around the world escalated as many of these programs were delayed from due to the recession 
also  sales into defense applications and into the automotive market for blind spot detection devices have increased in as compared to vs 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to in  the decline in sales was partially driven by the economic recession  although not to the same extent as some of our other businesses 
this segment was also impacted by the overall worldwide softness in the wireless infrastructure market and delays in spending on g program awards in china 
these declines were partially offset by strong demand for high frequency materials into the satellite television market for low noise block down converters lnbs in china  with moderate demand in the us and europe

the sales growth in was driven by the particularly strong demand for busbar products in asia for mass transit applications  as investment continues into the infrastructure of that region 
clean technology applications for renewable energy and power electronics also experienced increased demand for these products  particularly across europe and asia 
operating profit  however  declined in primarily due to the absorption of additional overhead charges as a result of the growth of the business in new regions and markets  as well as the changing mix of sales and profits across our businesses and the impact on our allocation methodologies 
vs 
net sales in this segment declined slightly from million in to million in and operating results also declined from a profit of million in to a profit of million in these declines were partially driven by the recession  particularly in the first half of  although this segment was impacted to a lesser degree than most of our other segments 
overall  sales of power distribution systems products were relatively strong into the mass transit market  as well as into clean technology markets  particularly for wind turbine applications  where demand continues to grow as more countries focus on alternative clean energy sources 
development stage dollars in millions printed and electronic solutions net sales operating loss thermal management systems net sales operating loss as previously noted  we reorganized our segment structure in the second quarter of due to management s current view of the business 
this resulted in the creation of the development stage business category  which is comprised of our printed and electronic solutions pes and thermal management systems tms operating segments 
both of these segments are considered to be development stage by management as they are both working to create new platforms with the goal of developing them into successful  profitable businesses that generate positive cash flows 
printed and electronic solutions this segment  which was formerly known as the durel operating segment and was previously included in our custom electrical components reportable segment  has undergone a significant shift in its business in the past few years 
it was previously focused on the sales of electroluminescent el lamps and inverter drivers that were used primarily in portable communications and automotive markets 
the el lamp business has effectively been replaced with new technology and the remaining sales volumes in this business are primarily related to the remaining inverter business  with a small amount of el lamp sales into the automotive industry 
note that results included charges of million related to asset impairments and million related to severance 
thermal management systems our tms business was formed at the end of and is focused on serving markets where thermal heat management is a priority  such as heat dissipation in electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles 
this venture recognized its first material sales in the second quarter of  as it received its first significant order for its base plate products 
we continue to pursue additional opportunities in the marketplace for these products 
management closely monitors the businesses in this segment to determine if continued investment in their technology platforms will yield positive returns and cash flows for the company and our investors 
ultimately  decision points will be reached as to whether to continue to invest in these initiatives to grow the businesses  at which point they would no longer be considered development stage and be moved into our more stable  core businesses  or to no longer invest in them if we believe that future growth and accretive performance is not likely 
other dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our other reportable segment consists of our elastomer rollers  floats  and non woven materials products  as well as our polyimide laminate systems distribution activities 
this segment formerly contained our tms operating segment  which is now reported as part of our development stage category of businesses 
also  this segment now includes the results of our former joint venture  pls  which became a wholly owned subsidiary as of march  in  net sales increased from million to million  primarily due to the inclusion of pls  which achieved million in sales in  partially offset by the elimination of million of sales in related to our flexible circuit materials business  which ceased activities prior to the start of the remaining increase is due to the improved performance of our elastomer rollers and floats products 
the segment also became profitable in  mainly due to the strong performance of the elastomer component and floats products and the inclusion of pls 
in  net sales decreased to million from million in and operating performance declined from a loss of million in to a loss of million in results included approximately million in asset impairment charges related to equipment and buildings and severance charges of million 
we continuously evaluate the viability of the product portfolio in this segment as it relates to our long term strategic and operational focus 
joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  our joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales increased from to following a decrease of from to the decreased sales volumes at the end of and through were due to softening demand  primarily as a result of the global recession 
sales in increased significantly due to increases in demand in the communications market 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris ris  our joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china  began operations in sales increased from to and decreased from to sales levels had improved in the third and fourth quarters of due primarily to the improvement in the chinese economy  which extended into performance 
the decline in sales for was a result of the global recession and excess inventory in the supply chain  particularly in the first half of rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  our joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit materials for customers in taiwan 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our interest in this joint venture to our joint venture partner for million  resulting in a gain of million 
polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  our joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sold adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
in the first quarter of  this joint venture was dissolved and we assumed any outstanding assets and liabilities of pls 
we also agreed that  going forward  all distribution activity that pls had previously engaged in would be conducted through rogers 
as of december   this distribution activity is minimal 
discontinued operations on october   we closed on an agreement to sell the shares of our induflex subsidiary to bv capital partners 
under the terms of the agreement  rogers received approximately million us million at the october  spot price  which represented the purchase price of approximately million euros plus other amounts due under the agreement 
in addition to this purchase price  there is an opportunity for rogers to receive additional earnout amounts for three years from the date of the sale based on the future performance of the divested business 
as of december   no such earnout has been earned  and we do not anticipate there to be any earnout earned upon completion of the three year period 
this subsidiary had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
net income of million and million have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the net gain reflected as discontinued operations at december  includes a million gain related to the sale of induflex 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the tax related to the discontinued operations was million and million of tax expense for december  and december   respectively 
there was no effect on operating results in  as a result of this discontinued operation 
product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our businesses by developing cost effective solutions that enable or improve the performance of customers products  as well as identifying acquisition opportunities to expand our product and market presence 
our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development 
however  in a period of rising sales  research and development expenditures do not increase at the pace of sales  and therefore  there is often a delay in meeting our targeted investment level  thus the decline in going forward  we will continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
with our acquisition of curamik  we will reevaluate our targeted long term spending rate and adjust our spending targets  if necessary  in the future 
we introduced a variety of new products during for example  our high performance foams business introduced a poron product that provides enhanced shock resistance for mobile internet device displays  an acoustic poron foam product for mobile internet device speakers and a new generation of bisco foam for mass transit floors with a superior flame rating 
our printed circuit materials business introduced a new product that helps enable smaller complex multilayer circuits for base station infrastructure and several products aimed at high reliability applications operating in harsh environments 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by our financial position gaining strength throughout we had been debt free since but in the first quarter of we drew down our line of credit for approximately million for the acquisition of curamik electronics gmbh 
we believe that we will continue to finance our operational needs through internally generated funds and that over the next twelve months  our cash position and internally generated funds during the year will be sufficient to meet the debt service  capital expenditures and ongoing financial needs of our business 
in addition  we continue to have access to the remaining portion of the line of credit should any unforeseen need impact the business 
we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our lending facilities and banking relationships

the increase from to is a result of the sales increases in the high performance foams and printed circuit materials operating segments 
additionally  inventory levels increased by million and million due to the impact of the utis acquisition and the pls dissolution  respectively 
an increase in accounts receivable of million in  versus an increase of million in and a decrease of million in the continued increase in from is primarily due to increased sales volumes even though collections remained strong 
the impact of utis and pls was million and million  respectively 
an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million as compared to a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in the increase in is primarily due to the accrual of the annual incentive compensation plan  combined with increased purchases of raw materials to meet the increased customer demands 
the decrease in was related to the payout in of the annual incentive compensation plan and the payout of million related to the settlement of the calamp lawsuit 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in raw material purchases related to the decreased production levels which is further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable periods as discussed above  driven by our efforts to maintain cash flows in the face of lower sales in a declining economy 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million and million in the investing activities of include million related to the purchase of utis  while in we used approximately million of cash for the acquisition of certain assets of the mti global  inc business and for a million investment in solicore
