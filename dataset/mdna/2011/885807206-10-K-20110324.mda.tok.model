item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs targeting the microenvironment of solid tumors as novel treatments for patients living with cancer 
the microenvironment of solid tumors is characterized by  among other things  hypoxia or lack of oxygen as a consequence of disordered blood vessel growth 
this hypoxic environment is known to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation 
it is thought to be responsible for the poor prognosis of patients with solid tumors and treating the hypoxic environment is currently believed to be a significant unmet medical need 
our hypoxia activated prodrug hap product candidates  including th are designed to specifically target the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors by selective activation of the prodrug to release a potent cytotoxin 
our focus is on product candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer 
our clinical development efforts are currently focused on one product candidate for which we have exclusive worldwide marketing rights 
th  which we discovered  is our lead product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
it is a novel drug candidate that is activated under severe hypoxic conditions that are believed to be present in all solid tumors 
th is currently in phase  phase and phase clinical trials 
in june  we reported updated top line results from the phase monotherapy trial of th including updated data in patients with metastatic melanoma and small cell lung cancer sclc 
we also reported updated top line interim results from each of four phase combination therapy investigations of a chemotherapy agent plus th including updated data in patients with first line pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine plus th and in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with doxorubicin plus th in october  we reported updated top line results from our phase combination therapy trial  including updated data in patients with first line pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine plus th we reported updated top line results from the phase monotherapy and phase combination therapy trials in the fourth quarter of  including updated data in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with doxorubicin plus th we also initiated two clinical studies in the second quarter of a phase open label clinical trial of th in patients with advanced leukemias and a randomized  controlled phase trial of th in combination with gemcitabine in patients with first line pancreatic cancer 
we reported top line results from the phase open label clinical trial in advanced leukemias in the fourth quarter of and expect to report updated top line results in the second half of we also expect to report top line efficacy analysis results from the randomized phase trial at the end of we have reached agreement with the fda on the design and planned analysis of pivotal phase trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma 
as part of the special protocol assessment spa submission  the fda has agreed that the design and planned analysis of the proposed phase trial adequately addresses the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 
we expect to initiate the pivotal phase trial in the middle of we are working to broaden the applicability of th to other cancers as well as to discover additional hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 
we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates  and prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public 
table of contents offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
in august  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  and our cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
in february and march  we raised net proceeds of million through the sale of common stock pursuant to our at market issuance facility 
in march  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of approximately million  which includes underwriter discounts and estimated offering costs 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we execute our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to be higher in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and initiation of new clinical trials 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   along with net proceeds from our at market issuances and march offering will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of  including prosecuting our current ongoing clinical trials and conducting research and discovery efforts toward additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to complete existing clinical trials and initiate new trials in research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates in the near term 
from to  we recognized million in revenue related to the upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue has been recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  through december  in  the company had no further responsibilities for development activities under this agreement and in may  the company dissolved the joint development committee jdc comprising medibic and us 
no payments were made by either party as a result of the dissolution of the jdc 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will increase in the future as we progress with larger clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and 
table of contents accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value provisions of accounting standard codification asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method  except for options granted prior to our initial public offering in february  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  no revenue was recognized 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses  million in higher staffing expenses and million in higher consulting expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million cash grant and a million decrease in facilities expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 
research and development expenses by project in thousands years ended december  th glufosfamide dg discovery research total research and development expenses we discontinued development activities for dg in research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for the increase of million was primarily due to million in clinical and manufacturing expenses  million in employee related expenses and million in consulting expenses 
th continues to progress through the trial  the trial and the trial 
enrollment in the and the trials was completed in the second quarter of the trial was expanded and is expected to continue to enroll patients 
in addition  in june the company initiated a phase randomized controlled combination therapy clinical trial in patients with first line pancreatic cancer and a phase monotherapy clinical trial in patients with advanced leukemias 
discovery research and development expenses were million for compared to million for we continue to focus our efforts towards discovering and developing new drug candidates from our hypoxia activated prodrug platform 
due to our exclusive licensing development and commercialization of glufosfamide to eleison pharmaceutical  inc in october  we did not incur significant research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide for we incurred no significant expenses related to dg for the as we are not currently planning or conducting further additional clinical trials of dg 

table of contents we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and start of new clinical trials 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects a million decrease in stock based compensation  partially offset by million in higher staffing and facilities expenses 
we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same or to slightly increase in compared to interest income expense  net interest income expense net for was million of interest income compared to  of net interest expense for the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the million in interest expense related to notes payable that were repaid in other income expense other income expense for was non cash income of million compared to non cash expense of million  for the non cash income for compared to the non cash expense for was due to the decline during in the fair value of outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of common stock warrants

th continues to progress through the phase monotherapy clinical trial initiated in july  for which in the first quarter of  we expanded enrollment to explore activity in specific indications 
in addition th continues to progress through the phase combination therapy clinical trial  which includes three separate treatment arms and a phase combination therapy clinical trial of th in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma  both of which were initiated in third quarter of 
table of contents research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decline in expenses was due to the completion and announcement of results for our phase trials in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma in and discontinuation of our phase trials in recurrent sensitive sclc and platinum resistant ovarian cancer in october and january  respectively 
in october  we exclusively licensed development and commercialization of glufosfamide to eleison and as a result  we do not expect to incur research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide in the future 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  as we completed enrollment of our dg phase trial in second quarter of and announced results in third quarter of we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million decrease in stock based compensation  million in lower staffing and facilities expense and million in lower consulting expenses 
interest income expense  net interest income expense net for was a net interest expense of  compared to net interest income of million for the change was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates during compared to the prior year 
other income expense interest and other expense for the years ended december  was million

in august  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to per share subject to adjustment 
as a result of our october offering  the exercise price of the warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of common stock was reduced to per share pursuant to the terms of such warrants 
net proceeds generated from the offering were million 
in october  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and  for a purchase price equal to per share  warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to million in connection with the offering 
the warrants had an exercise price equal to per share subject to adjustment 
as a result of our march offering  the exercise price of the warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of common stock was reduced to per share pursuant to the terms of such warrants

in march  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and  for a purchase price equal to per share  warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to million in connection with the offering 
the warrants have an exercise price equal to per share 
net proceeds generated from the offering were approximately million  which includes underwriter discounts and estimated offering costs 
in august  our board of directors approved a for reverse split of our common stock  effective august  accordingly  all references to common shares of stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split 
we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as an increase in accrued clinical development expenses  partially offset by revaluation of warrant liability 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  revaluation of warrant liability and depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as an increase in accrued clinical development expenses 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses  offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in august  offset by repayments of notes payable totaling for the year 
we expect cash requirements to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   along with net proceeds from our at market issuances and march offering will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of including prosecuting our current trials  conducting research and discovery efforts towards additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to complete clinical trials that we started in 
table of contents we expect to need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our future operations 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq capital market and our compliance with continued listing requirements 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million for working capital and equipment purchases 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount under this facility 
at december   all borrowing under this facility had been fully repaid 
in april  we amended the existing loan and security agreement to borrow up to an additional million for working capital and equipment purchases 
the interest rate for borrowings under this facility was determined based on the month us treasury note plus on the date of borrowing 
we borrowed million under this facility  which was repaid over a month period from the date of borrowing 
the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
at june   borrowings under this facility were paid in full 
in august  we entered into a noncancelable facilities sublease agreement that expired on february  for our headquarters in redwood city  california 
in february  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of office space and extended the lease term for the existing space located at our headquarters in redwood city  california to september  the lease is for a period of months  beginning on april  with respect to the additional square footage and began on march  with respect to the square footage previously leased under our august sublease agreement 
the lease will expire  unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the lease  on september  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs and expenses associated with the premises as well as a customary management fee 
we are also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the lease  we furnished a letter of credit to the landlord for approximately million 

table of contents on april   we entered into a noncancelable facilities lease agreement that originally expired on february  for an additional  square feet of laboratory space in redwood city  california 
on november   we extended the term of the lease agreement to expire in august our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our financing and lease agreements  and purchase commitments 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december   are as follows in thousands within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total facilities sublease and lease purchase commitments total at market issuance facility on october   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
sales of our common stock through mlv will be made on the nasdaq capital market  on any other existing trading market for our common stock  to or through a market maker or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement  mlv will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose 
we will pay mlv an aggregate commission rate of of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share of any common stock sold under the sales agreement 
under certain circumstances  sales of the stock under the at market issuances sales agreement could result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
the number of shares we are able to sell under this arrangement will be limited in practice based on the trading volume of our common stock 
as of december  we had not sold any stock pursuant to the sales agreement 
in february and march  we sold  shares of our common stock at an average price of pursuant to the sales agreement 
net proceeds from the sale of stock were million 
the sale of the stock did not result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
on march   we filed a prospectus supplement reducing the amount of securities for sale under our shelf registration statement pursuant to the sales agreement 
the maximum aggregate gross proceeds from potential future sales of common stock under our existing shelf registration statement are million 
license and development agreements on october   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals  inc eleison 
pursuant to the agreement we granted eleison exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize glufosfamide for the treatment of cancer in humans and animals  and certain other uses 
under the agreement  eleison is responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of glufosfamide 
eleison and threshold will share equally in the profits of commercialization  if the further clinical development of glufosfamide leads to regulatory approval and marketing 
eleison will pay us of its profits from commercialization on a quarterly basis  beginning on the date of first commercial sale  if any 
eleison has the right to sublicense some or all of its rights under the agreement  and will pay us of amounts received under any sublicenses  including  without limitation  any royalty payments  license fee payments  milestone payments and payments for any equity or debt purchases by a sublicensee  within days of the receipt of any such amounts or payments by eleison 
eleison will bear all costs associated with development  commercialization and patent prosecution  and will control product development and commercialization 
in addition  eleison will be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments due under the baxter license and medibic 
table of contents development agreement discussed below 
the agreement contemplates that eleison  to satisfy its diligence obligations  will raise sufficient funds to commence clinical development activities with glufosfamide 
in november  we entered into an agreement with medibic to develop glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries  and received an upfront payment of million contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan 
in july  we finalized the development plan with medibic and began recognizing revenue from the upfront payment on a straight line basis over the development period  through december  we were responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
we will also be required to make royalty payments upon product commercialization 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by making certain payments ranging from million to million  depending on the stage of development of the glufosfamide product in japan 
in  we had no further responsibilities for development activities under this agreement and in may  we dissolved the joint development committee jdc comprising medibic and us 
no payments were made by either party as a result of the dissolution of the jdc 
in august  we entered into an agreement with baxter for the licensing and development of glufosfamide 
under this agreement  we paid baxter an upfront license fee of million and a million development milestone in we also made a development milestone payment of million in november and we are obligated to make certain additional development milestone payments  with the next payment due in connection with the filing of a new drug application with the fda for glufosfamide 
we will be required to make a milestone payment of million within days of filing an nda for glufosfamide with the fda 
future milestone payments in connection with the development of glufosfamide and united states and foreign regulatory submissions could total up to million  and sales based milestone payments could total up to million 
following regulatory approval  we will be obligated to pay up to mid single digit royalties to baxter based on sales of glufosfamide products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make development or sales based milestone or royalty payments to baxter 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized the federal carryforward will expire in during the year ended december   the company wrote down its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are expected to expire before utilization due to the annual limitation 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of asc which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing asc including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc  equity 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock  as the underlying equity instruments vest 
the two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each clinical trial and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based upon the levels of inputs described below  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 

table of contents we adopted asc  fair value and measurements  in the first quarter of asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
our short term investments primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
asc requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy  the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation 
our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include securities available for sale 
securities available for sale include money market funds  government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
fair value of warrants prior to january   common stock warrants were recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging and asc  financial instruments 
however in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance now codified in asc that clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify for classification as a liability 
the new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the new guidance on january   resulted in the reclassification of our outstanding warrants from stockholders equity to liability and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our deficit accumulated during development stage of million 
in addition  the stock warrants are required to be fair valued at each reporting period  with the changes in fair value recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we fair value the warrants using a black scholes valuation model 
since the outstanding common stock warrants are fair valued at the end of each reporting period  any change in the underlying assumptions to the black scholes valuation model  including the volatility and price of our common stock  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method 
this asu provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
under the milestone method of revenue recognition  
table of contents consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety can be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
this standard provides the criteria to be met for a milestone to be considered substantive which includes that a performance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone  and b relate to past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
this standard is effective on a prospective basis for milestones in fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted  and applies to milestones achieved on or after that time 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures  to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  this guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
asu became effective for us on january   except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level fair value measurements  which will become effective for us on january  other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
we will be required to apply this guidance prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   however  earlier application is permitted 
we do not expect that this update will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds and investments in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
