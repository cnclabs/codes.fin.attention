table of contents part i item business general cardinal health  inc is an ohio corporation formed in as used in this report  we  our  us and similar pronouns refer to cardinal health  inc and its subsidiaries  unless the context requires otherwise 
we are a healthcare services company providing products and services that help pharmacies  hospitals  surgery centers  physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs  enhancing efficiency and improving quality 
our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal  and are to the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
except as otherwise specified  information in this form k is provided as of june  business segments the following business discussion is based on our two segments as they were structured for fiscal pharmaceutical segment in the united states  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical  over the counter healthcare  and consumer products through its pharmaceutical distribution business to retailers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals  and alternate care providers including mail order pharmacies 
this business maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers 
helps pharmaceutical manufacturers with services including distribution  inventory management  data reporting  new product launch support  and contract and chargeback administration 
operates nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities that manufacture  prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics  distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party payors and healthcare service providers supporting the marketing  distribution  and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products  franchises retail pharmacies under the medicine shoppe and medicap brands  and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
in china  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded  generic and specialty pharmaceuticals as well as medical  surgical  over the counter and consumer products through our yong yu subsidiary 
yong yu is one of the largest importers of pharmaceuticals into china and reaches a wide range of customers including more than  hospitals and clinics and more than  retail outlets 
the pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold  net of manufacturer cash discount  branded manufacturer margin  and generic manufacturer margin 
manufacturer cash discounts are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products 

table of contents branded manufacturer margin refers to compensation amounts under distribution service agreements with manufacturers and to pharmaceutical price appreciation 
amounts earned under the distribution service agreements compensate us for a range of distribution and related services we provide to manufacturers and consist of a fee based on volume with or without pharmaceutical price appreciation 
in addition  a manufacturer may increase its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory 
our contract price for branded pharmaceutical products to customers is based on the manufacturer s published price at the time of sale 
as such  inventory sold following a manufacturer price increase will be based on the higher manufacturer price 
pharmaceutical price appreciation refers to amounts we earn from selling inventory at these increased prices 
generic manufacturer margin also referred to as generic margin refers to price discounts  rebates and other incentives we receive from manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals 
our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices tend to decline over time  although this may vary 
bulk and non bulk sales 
the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk sales based on the nature of our customers operations 
bulk sales consist of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses 
all other sales  including all sales to customers located in china  are classified as non bulk 
sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer are classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and non bulk sales with respect to its retail stores 
we formerly referred to bulk sales as bulk customers and non bulk sales as non bulk customers 
other than this change in terminology  we have not changed how we categorize revenue  segment expenses and segment profit with respect to our bulk and non bulk sales 
substantially all bulk sales consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer  a small portion of bulk sales are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
in contrast  non bulk sales require more complex servicing 
for non bulk sales  we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities  warehouse the product for a longer period of time  pick individual products specific to a customer s order  and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 
bulk sales generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales 
customers receive lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than non bulk sales due to volume pricing in a competitive market and due to lower costs related to the fewer services we provide 
in addition  bulk sales in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales  because bulk orders consist largely of higher cost branded products 
the higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue for bulk sales is also driven by lower branded manufacturer margin and manufacturer cash discounts due to the mix of branded products in bulk sales 
segment distribution  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales are substantially lower than from non bulk sales because bulk sales require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than non bulk sales 

table of contents the following table shows the revenues  segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk sales for fiscal  and in millions non bulk sales revenue from non bulk sales segment expenses allocated to non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from non bulk sales bulk sales revenue from bulk sales segment expenses allocated to bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales segment expenses and profit required complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that we believe are reasonable 
in addition  amounts do not include the impact of last in  first out lifo provisions  if any 
we had no lifo provisions in fiscal  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for pharmaceutical segment revenue  profit and assets for fiscal  and medical segment the medical segment distributes a broad range of medical  surgical and laboratory products to hospitals  surgery centers  laboratories  physician offices and other healthcare providers in the united states and canada 
this segment also manufactures  sources and develops its own line of private brand medical and surgical products 
manufactured products include single use surgical drapes  gowns and apparel  exam and surgical gloves  and fluid suction and collection systems 
the segment also offers sterile and non sterile procedure kits 
our manufactured products are sold directly or through third party distributors in the united states  canada  europe  south america and the asia pacific region 
in addition  the segment provides supply chain services  including spend management  distribution management  and inventory management services  to healthcare providers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for medical segment revenue  profit and assets for fiscal  and 
table of contents acquisitions and divestitures in the past five fiscal years  we completed the following three significant acquisitions apart from businesses spun off as part of carefusion corporation carefusion  as discussed below 
date company location line of business consideration in millions july  healthcare solutions holding  llc p healthcare ellicott city  maryland specialty pharmaceutical services november  yong yu shanghai  china pharmaceutical and medical products distribution december  kinray  inc kinray whitestone  new york pharmaceutical  generic  health and beauty  and home health care products distribution  represents the date we became the majority shareholder 
includes million in cash and million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration to be paid for the acquisition 
includes the assumption of approximately million in debt 
we also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years  including purchasing borschow hospital medical supplies  inc in fiscal during the past five fiscal years  we also completed several divestitures  including selling our former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  other than certain generic focused businesses  for approximately billion in cash during fiscal and selling our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business in fiscal in addition  effective august   we separated our clinical and medical products businesses through distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion the spin off 
during fiscal  we disposed of million shares of carefusion common stock and during fiscal  we disposed of the remaining million shares 
viasys healthcare inc and enturia inc  two significant acquisitions in the last five years  were spun off as part of carefusion 
customers our largest customers  walgreen co 
walgreens and cvs caremark corporation cvs  accounted for approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our revenue for fiscal the aggregate of our five largest customers  including walgreens and cvs  accounted for approximately percent of our revenue for fiscal we have agreements with group purchasing organizations gpos that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members 
our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp arrangements with these two gpos accounted for approximately percent of our revenue for fiscal suppliers we rely on many different suppliers 
products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately percent of our revenue during fiscal  but no single supplier s products accounted for more than percent of that revenue 
overall  we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 

table of contents the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year with an automatic renewal feature to five years 
generally  these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree  if there is an uncured breach of the agreement  or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 
our pharmaceutical segment s nuclear pharmacy services business dispenses several products prepared using a particular radioisotope 
during fiscal  it was difficult to acquire sufficient quantities of that radioisotope from third party suppliers because of a continued and prolonged shortage of a critical raw material used to derive that radioisotope 
however  the supply of raw material normalized in the first half of fiscal competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services 
we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development  manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products 
we compete on many levels  including service offerings  support services  breadth of product lines  and price 
in the pharmaceutical segment  we compete with two other national  full line wholesale distributors mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation and a number of regional wholesale distributors  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors  third party logistics companies  and nuclear pharmacies  among others 
in addition  the pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals  including telemarketers 
in the medical segment  we compete with many different distributors  including owens minor  inc  thermo fisher scientific inc  pss world medical  inc  henry schein  inc  and medline industries  inc 
in addition  we compete with regional medical products distributors  third party logistics companies and manufacturers direct distribution 
competitors of the medical segment s manufacturing and procedural kit businesses include kimberly clark corporation  ansell limited  deroyal industries inc  medline industries  inc  m lnlycke health care  america contract sterilization  professional hospital supply and medical action industries 
employees as of june   we had approximately  employees in the united states and approximately  employees outside of the united states 
overall  we consider our employee relations to be good 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and technical measures to protect our products  services and intangible assets 
we hold patents relating to aspects of our distribution operations  including our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings  and relating to medical and surgical products  such as fluid suction and irrigation devices  surgical waste management systems  surgical and medical examination gloves  surgical drapes  gowns and facial protection products  and patient temperature management products 
we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies  and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 
all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations  but we do not consider any particular patent  trademark  license  franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

table of contents regulatory matters our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
depending upon their specific business  our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including the united states food and drug administration the fda  the united states drug enforcement administration the dea  the united states nuclear regulatory commission the nrc  the united states department of health and human services hhs  united states customs and border protection  state boards of pharmacy  state controlled substance agencies  state health departments  insurance departments or other comparable state agencies  and foreign agencies that are comparable to those listed above

manufacturing and marketing 
our subsidiaries that manufacture and source medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems 
in addition  our medical segment s international manufacturing operations may be subject to local certification requirements 
the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements covering the design  testing  safety  effectiveness  manufacture  labeling  promotion and advertising  distribution and post market surveillance of some of our manufactured products 
we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries 
even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product  the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review 
to assess and facilitate compliance with federal  state and foreign regulatory requirements  we routinely review our quality and compliance systems to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify areas for improvement or remediation 
as part of our quality review  we assess the suppliers of raw materials  components and finished goods that are incorporated into the medical devices we manufacture 
in addition  we conduct quality management reviews designed to highlight key issues that may affect the quality of our products and services 

table of contents from time to time  we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications  regulatory requirements  or published standards 
when we identify a quality or regulatory issue  we investigate and take appropriate corrective action  such as withdrawing the product from the market  correcting the product at the customer location  revising product labeling  and notifying customers 
nuclear pharmacies and related businesses 
our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations from the nrc  the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate  and the state board of pharmacy 
in addition  the fda regulates cyclotron facilities and has issued  effective december  good manufacturing practices regulations for positron emission tomography pet drugs 
prescription drug pedigree tracking and supply chain integrity the fda amendments act of requires the fda to establish standards to identify and validate technologies for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs 
these standards may include track and trace or authentication technologies  such as radio frequency identification devices 
in march  the fda issued guidance establishing standardized numerical identifiers for prescription pharmaceutical packages 
some states have also adopted laws to prevent the introduction of counterfeit  diverted  adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the pharmaceutical supply chain 
for example  effective july  california requires that pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers implement electronic track and trace capabilities for pharmaceutical products 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws we are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
laws and regulations generally prohibit soliciting  offering  receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare  medicaid or other united states government sponsored healthcare programs 
they also prohibit submitting or causing to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government 
violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties as well as qui tam claims under the federal false claims act and similar state acts under which private persons may file suit on behalf of the federal and state governments 
health and personal information practices services and products provided by some of our businesses  including our pharmacy services and specialty pharmaceutical businesses  involve access to patient identifiable healthcare information 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  as well as some state laws  regulate the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information  including requiring specified privacy and security measures 
federal and state officials have increasingly focused on how patient identifiable healthcare information should be handled  secured and disclosed 
some of our businesses collect and maintain other personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information 
security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 
environmental  health and safety laws in the united states and other countries  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws as well as laws relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices 
laws relating to foreign trade and operations united states and international laws and regulations require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods  raw materials and supplies and the handling of information 
we also must comply 
table of contents with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations  which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 
also  we must abide by united states and foreign customs laws and regulations 
similarly  we are subject to laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations  including the united states foreign corrupt practices act  foreign anti bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of internal books and records 
these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering  promising or making payments to non united states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
other information our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements 
certain supply contracts with united states government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands  but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 
our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned  subject to restocking fees 
we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value  or that can be returned to vendors for credit

item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
these are not the only risks we face 
our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 
we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item above  we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
because of competition  our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers 
if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as enhanced cost control measures  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years  the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate 
further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item above  our sales and credit concentration is significant 
for example  walgreens and cvs accounted for approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our revenue for fiscal the aggregate of our five largest customers  including walgreens and cvs  accounted for approximately percent of our revenue for fiscal in addition  walgreens and cvs accounted for percent and percent  respectively  of our gross trade receivable balance at june  if one or more of our large customers default in payment  terminate or do not renew contracts  or significantly reduce their purchases of our products  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
the united states healthcare environment is changing in many ways  some of which may not be favorable to us  including changes resulting from federal healthcare legislation 
the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care  improve safety and contain costs 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined  the use of managed care has increased  distributors  manufacturers  healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated  and large purchasing groups are more prevalent 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the healthcare reform acts were enacted 
among other things  the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to approximately million uninsured americans 
many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until  including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance 
we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services  but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely 
the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid 
beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay a tax in an amount equal to percent of the price for which the manufacturer sells its medical devices 
we manufacture and sell devices that will be subject to this tax 
additionally  the healthcare reform acts changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than percent of the average weighted manufacturer s price from percent of the lowest average manufacturer s price for generic pharmaceuticals 
we could be adversely affected by  among other things  changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  medical devices or healthcare services 
our business requires consistent  diligent and rigorous compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
as described above in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item  we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
in addition  the united states federal government and state governments are devoting greater resources to the enforcement of these laws 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  or if allegations are made that we fail to comply  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
to lawfully operate our businesses  we are required to hold permits  licenses and other regulatory approvals from  and to comply with operating and security standards of  governmental bodies 
failure to maintain or renew  or obtain without significant delay  necessary permits  licenses or approvals  or to comply with required standards  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
products that we manufacture  source  distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements 
noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance could result in product corrective actions  recalls or seizures  warning letters  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution  civil or criminal sanctions  governmental refusal to grant approvals  restrictions on 
table of contents operations  withdrawal of existing approvals and third party claims  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
if we fail to comply with them  we could be subject to federal or state government investigations  or false claims act proceedings initiated by private parties  which could result in civil judgments and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the scope or requirements of these laws or regulations may be interpreted or applied by a regulator  prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact or require us to change our operations 
our global operations are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with united states and foreign export control  trade embargo and customs laws 
if we fail to comply with them  we could suffer civil and criminal penalties 
we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries 
as a result  we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of many jurisdictions 
from time to time  legislative initiatives are proposed  such as the repeal of lifo last in  first out treatment of inventory or the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries  that could adversely affect our tax positions  effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others 
these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
our pharmaceutical segment s margin may be affected by prices established by manufacturers or market forces that are beyond our control 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item  we generate a portion of our branded manufacturer margin from pharmaceutical price appreciation 
if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by smaller amounts  we will earn less branded manufacturer margin 
in addition  prices for generic pharmaceuticals distributed by our pharmaceutical distribution business have generally declined over time  which could have an adverse effect on our generic manufacturer margin  if not offset by generic pharmaceutical programs  including new product launches 
our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 
we rely on information systems to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products  and generate financial transactions and information 
our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities  including our national logistics center 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities are interrupted  
table of contents damaged by unforeseen events or actions of third parties  or fail for any extended period of time 
any data security breach could adversely impact our operations  results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements 
the medical segment is working on a medical business transformation project  which includes a new information system for certain supply chain processes 
the medical segment is planning to transition selected processes to the new system throughout fiscal and if the system is not effectively implemented or fails to operate as intended  it could adversely affect the medical segment s supply chain operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
because of the nature of our business  we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 
due to the nature of our businesses  which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products  we may from time to time become involved in legal proceedings 
for instance  some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party  subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims 
while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance  it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could harm our cash flows or results of operations 
acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 
an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses 
as described above  in fiscal  we acquired kinray  p healthcare and yong yu 
acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition  we may encounter unforeseen accounting or internal control over financial reporting issues  or the acquired business may have regulatory or compliance issues that we did not anticipate 
we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 
we depend on the availability of various components  compounds  raw materials and energy including radioisotopes and oil based resins  cotton  latex  diesel fuel and other commodities supplied by others for our operations 
any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  or could be terminated 
a sustained interruption in the flow of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  while we have processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations 
our manufacturing businesses use oil based resins  cotton  latex  and other commodities as raw materials in many products 
prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs 
prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years  so our costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated 
due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations  we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices 
if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions  or recover these costs through price increases or fuel surcharges  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our global operations are subject to economic  political and currency risks 
our global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession  currency volatility and competition 
political changes can disrupt our supply chain as well as our customers and 
table of contents operating activities in a particular location 
we may not be able to enter into hedges or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks  and any hedges that we enter into or insurance that we are able to obtain may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 
risks associated with the spin off 
carefusion may not satisfy all of its contractual obligations 
we entered into a number of agreements with carefusion that govern the rights and obligations of the parties following the spin off 
we have certain rights under those agreements  including indemnification against certain liabilities allocated to carefusion 
the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the transaction may have unexpected tax consequences 
in connection with the spin off  we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax free transaction under sections and a d of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spin off would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel 
similarly  the irs could determine on audit that the spin off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons  including as a result of certain significant changes in stock ownership of either cardinal health or carefusion 
if the spin off is determined to be taxable for united states federal income tax purposes  we and our shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to plans to sell our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business within our pharmaceutical segment  and met the criteria for classification of this business as discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we committed to plans to sell our former pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  other than certain generic focused businesses  and met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
for additional information regarding discontinued operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this accounting guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting guidance was a million reduction of retained earnings 
as noted above  on august   we completed the distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining million shares of carefusion common stock 
the distribution of carefusion common stock to our shareholders resulted in the recognition of a billion non cash dividend 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented below refers to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are referring to our continuing operations 
executive overview we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies  hospitals  surgery centers  physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs  enhancing efficiency and improving quality 
we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
during fiscal  we achieved record revenue of billion and increased our operating earnings by percent to billion 
we also acted on important strategic priorities that will strengthen our long term position 
we expanded our retail independent customer base significantly with the kinray acquisition  created strong growth from our generic pharmaceutical programs  significantly enhanced our specialty business with the p healthcare acquisition  and launched a growth platform in china with our yong yu acquisition 
during fiscal  our pharmaceutical segment profit increased by percent  primarily due to strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs  including the impact of new product launches  solid performance under our branded manufacturer agreements  and the positive impact of acquisitions 
our medical segment profit decreased by percent  adversely affected by the increased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured and private brand products 
also during fiscal  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per share  or per share on an annualized basis  an increase of percent over fiscal in may  the board of directors also approved a percent increase in the quarterly dividend beginning in july our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  we used billion for acquisitions and received billion of net cash provided by operations and million from the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion 
we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 
trends within our pharmaceutical segment  we expect branded pharmaceutical price appreciation in fiscal to be similar to fiscal we also expect significant new generic pharmaceutical launches in fiscal  however  their impact on our gross margin can vary significantly depending on timing  size  and number of entrants  and may be less in fiscal than in fiscal in addition  we expect our recent acquisitions to have a positive year over year impact on revenue and operating earnings 
finally  we may have a negative impact from a lifo charge in fiscal within our medical segment  variability in the cost of commodities such as oil based resins  cotton  latex  diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold 
in fiscal  we anticipate a negative year over year impact from higher commodity prices 
in addition  given the current economic and healthcare environments  we expect healthcare utilization  including surgical procedures  to remain somewhat sluggish in fiscal 
table of contents acquisitions in december  we acquired kinray for a cash payment of billion 
this acquisition expanded the ability of our pharmaceutical distribution business to serve retail independent pharmacies in the northeastern united states 
in november  we acquired yong yu  a leading health care distribution business in china  for million  including the assumption of million in debt 
the pharmaceutical market in china is expected to grow significantly faster than the market in the united states over the next few years 
in july  we completed the acquisition of p healthcare  a specialty pharmaceutical services company  for a cash payment of million 
this acquisition contributes to the expansion of our presence in specialty pharmaceutical services and distribution 
the acquisition agreement also included a contingent consideration obligation of up to million over the next three years 
since we completed the acquisition  we have made a cash payment of million for the first measurement period 
subsequent to june   we amended the agreement with the former owners to extend the last measurement period by one year and to reduce the maximum contingent consideration payout to million 
at june   we estimate the remaining contingent consideration obligation to have a fair value of million 
the three acquisitions are reported within our pharmaceutical segment 
for fiscal  they increased revenues by billion and operating earnings by million compared to fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the kinray  yong yu and p healthcare acquisitions 
spin off of carefusion effective august   we separated our clinical and medical products business through the distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining million shares of carefusion common stock 
during fiscal and  we disposed of million and million shares of carefusion common stock  respectively 
on july   we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion to effect the spin off and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spin off 
in addition  on august   we entered into a transition services agreement  a tax matters agreement and an accounts receivable factoring agreement with carefusion  among other agreements 
under the transition services agreement  during fiscal and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in transition service fees  which approximately offsets the costs associated with providing the transition services 
substantially all of the transition service arrangements expired in fiscal and early fiscal we expect that transition service fees in fiscal will be substantially less than in fiscal and that the loss of fees in fiscal will be partially offset by cost reductions 
for periods subsequent to fiscal  we have plans in place to largely offset the loss of fees with cost reductions 
under the accounts receivable factoring agreement  during fiscal and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of carefusion trade receivables 
the accounts receivable factoring arrangement expired on april  under the tax matters agreement  carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spin off 
the indemnification receivable was million and million at june  and  respectively  and is included in our consolidated financial statements 
we expect the transition of our relationship with carefusion to a traditional distribution model during the fourth quarter of fiscal to have a to million per quarter positive impact on medical segment revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal however  we expect this change to have minimal impact on medical segment profit 

table of contents results of operations revenue change revenue in millions  except growth rates pharmaceutical medical total segment revenue corporate nm nm consolidated revenues fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment during fiscal  pharmaceutical revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions  net of divestitures billion and increased sales to existing customers billion 
revenue was negatively impacted by losses of customers in excess of gains million 
revenue from bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  revenue from bulk sales decreased percent as a result of the conversion of branded pharmaceuticals to generic pharmaceuticals as well as a shift in sales to certain national chain customers to non bulk from bulk 
revenue from non bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from non bulk sales increased percent  during fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions and the previously mentioned shift in sales 
all sales for kinray  yong yu and p healthcare are non bulk 
see item business for more information about bulk and non bulk sales 
medical segment medical revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by increased volume from existing customers million 
these revenue gains were partially offset by the impact of lost customers in excess of gains million and decreased volume as a result of strong demand for flu related products in the prior year million 
fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by pharmaceutical price appreciation and increased volume from existing customers a combined impact of billion  partially offset by losses of customers in excess of gains billion 
medical segment medical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by increased volume from existing hospital  laboratory and ambulatory care customers million  driven partially by strong demand for flu related products 
also positively impacting revenue were new products million and foreign exchange million 
in addition  in connection with the spin off  we recognized previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion of million prior to the spin off  we deferred revenue for products sold to carefusion businesses until the products were sold to the end customers 
losses of existing customers in excess of gains from new customers reduced revenue by million

strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs  including the impact of new product launches  increased gross margin by million 
acquisitions  net of divestitures  positively impacted gross margin by million 
increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales exclusive of the related volume impact had a positive impact on gross margin of million 
the increase was primarily due to our performance under distribution service agreements and the transition of certain vendors to distribution service agreements 
factors that can influence margin from branded pharmaceutical sales include our service level performance under distribution service agreements  our inventory level and mix  and the magnitude and timing of pharmaceutical price appreciation 
customer pricing changes including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact adversely impacted gross margin by million 
the adverse impact of these customer pricing changes is partially offset by product mix  sourcing programs and other sources of margin 
medical segment gross margin decreased million in fiscal primarily as a result of the factors listed below 
increased cost of oil based resins  cotton  latex  diesel fuel and other commodities used in our self manufactured and private brand products decreased gross margin by million 
increased net sales volume resulted in a million favorable impact to gross margin 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we realized a one time gain of million as a result of the recognition of previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 
somewhat sluggish healthcare utilization disproportionately affected surgical procedures and consequently our higher margin products 
fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment gross margin decreased million in fiscal as a result of the factors listed below 
pricing changes on renewed customer contracts exclusive of the related volume impact decreased gross margin by million 
in fiscal  medicine shoppe offered an alternative franchise model to its franchisees to position the franchise system for future growth 
this transformation adversely impacted gross margin by million in fiscal  however  this was partially offset by efficiencies gained within sg a 

table of contents increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales exclusive of the related volume impact had a positive impact on gross margin of million despite the adverse timing impact of the transition of a significant vendor relationship to a distribution service agreement 
sales volume growth in pharmaceutical distribution had a positive impact of million 
within nuclear pharmacy  for fiscal  the negative impact of the isotope supply shortage was largely offset by the use of alternative isotopes and the favorable impact of cost of materials savings from conversion to generic products 
however  there was a negative impact in the second half of the year due to the severe shortages we experienced during that period 
the favorable impact of various generic pharmaceutical product programs in pharmaceutical distribution was partially offset by lower generic margins due to timing and value of new generic launches 
medical segment gross margin increased million in fiscal as a result of the factors listed below 
increased sales volume resulted in a million increase in gross margin 
decreased cost of oil based resins and other commodities favorably impacted gross margin by million

sg a also included costs related to the spin off of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal increased sg a during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our management incentive compensation 
in fiscal  we had incentive compensation accruals that were million above plan due to better than expected consolidated performance compared with incentive compensation accruals that were million below plan in fiscal in addition  we incurred increased spending on strategic projects million

we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance  acquisition related costs  impairments and gain loss on sale of assets  litigation recoveries charges  net  certain investment and other spending to our segments 
these costs are retained at corporate 
investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects which require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional operating expenses 
we encourage our segments to identify investment projects which will promote innovation and provide future returns 
as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management  the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate 
in addition  spin off costs included within sg a are not allocated to our segments 
pharmaceutical segment the principal drivers for fiscal compared to the prior year were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs  including the impact of new product launches  the positive impact of acquisitions  and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales  offset by customer pricing changes 
see the gross margin section above for discussion of these items 
the principal drivers for the decrease during fiscal were pricing changes on renewed customer contracts  fewer significant generic pharmaceutical launches than the prior year and the medicine shoppe franchise transformation 
the decline in segment profit was partially offset by contributions from our generic programs  disciplined cost controls and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical sales 
segment profit from bulk sales increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and was percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years 
segment profit from non bulk sales increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and was percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years 
the generic pharmaceutical items and acquisitions discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from non bulk sales 
medical segment compared to the prior year  results for fiscal were adversely affected by increased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured and private brand products partially offset by increased sales volume 
results also were impacted by the negative year over year impact of recognizing in fiscal a one time gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 
the principal drivers for the increase during fiscal were growth in sales to certain existing customers and decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements 
results were also positively affected by the one time gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 
segment profit growth was partially dampened from increased spending on strategic projects 

table of contents consolidated operating earnings in addition to revenue  gross margin and sg a discussed above  operating earnings were impacted by the following in millions restructuring and employee severance acquisition related costs impairments and loss on sale of assets litigation recoveries charges  net restructuring and employee severance fiscal  and restructuring and employee severance charges included million  million and million  respectively  of costs arising from the spin off 
acquisition related costs during fiscal  net acquisition related costs included million  related to the kinray  yong yu and p healthcare acquisitions 
the costs were partially offset by million of income as a result of a decrease in the contingent consideration liability relating to the p healthcare acquisition  which reflects actual performance for the first measurement period and changes in our estimate of performance in future measurement periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this change 
impairments and loss on sale of assets in fiscal  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to the write down of specialtyscripts  a business within our pharmaceutical segment 
we completed the sale of specialtyscripts during the third quarter of fiscal litigation recoveries charges  net in fiscal  we received income of million resulting from settlement of a class action antitrust claim in which we were a class member 
in addition  we received million of income for insurance proceeds released from escrow after litigation  commenced against certain directors and officers in  was resolved 
earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations in addition to items discussed above  earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following change earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations in millions  except growth rates other income expense  net nm interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt nm nm gain on sale of carefusion common stock nm nm interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense for fiscal was primarily due to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps 

table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal  we recognized a million loss from the early retirement of over billion of debt securities through a tender offer 
gain on sale of investment in carefusion common stock we recognized million and million of income during fiscal and  respectively  related to realized gains from the sale of shares of carefusion common stock 
provision for income taxes generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items 
a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal  and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation fiscal year ended june  provision at federal statutory rate state and local income taxes  net of federal benefit change in measurement of an uncertain tax position foreign tax rate differential unremitted foreign earnings valuation allowances other effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by million  or percentage points  attributable to recognizing no income tax expense on the sale of carefusion stock due to the release of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 
an unfavorable charge attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore in fiscal favorably impacted the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate see below 
fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a charge of million  or percentage points  attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore 
the fiscal effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by percentage points due to changes in our business mix resulting from the spin off which resulted in a higher percentage of our pretax income being generated in the united states than in lower tax rate international jurisdictions 
a favorable audit settlement with a state taxing authority in fiscal also unfavorably impacted the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate 
ongoing audits the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years through we have received proposed adjustments from the irs related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us 
the irs proposed additional taxes of million  excluding penalties and interest 
if this tax ultimately must be 
table of contents paid  carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for million of the total amount 
we disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them  and we believe our accruals for these matters are adequate 
earnings loss from discontinued operations carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spin off  and had a significant impact on earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal and see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 
recent developments in late august  the fda notified us that it was halting entry into the united states of all procedure kits that we assemble in mexico and import at el paso  texas imported kits 
the fda indicated that we had not supplied adequate documentary support for certain components of the imported kits  but has not indicated any concerns about patient safety 
we are working with the fda to address their concerns  and  in the interim  are implementing steps to mitigate the impact to customers and our business  including shifting assembly of kits to facilities in the united states 
sales of the imported kits were approximately percent of medical segment revenue in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we currently believe that  based upon available capital resources cash on hand  projected operating cash flow  and access to committed credit facilities  we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs  currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  contractual obligations  current and projected debt service requirements  dividends and share repurchases 
during fiscal  we acquired kinray  yong yu and p healthcare with cash on hand 
if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions  depending on the size and timing of such transactions  we may need supplemental funding 
capital resources cash and equivalents our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  at june   our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks around the world or invested in high quality  short term liquid investments 
the decrease was primarily driven by acquisitions  offset by net cash provided by operating activities which is primarily driven by net earnings and working capital  and the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion 
changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases  customer payments of accounts receivable  and payments to vendors during the regular course of business 
we use days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and days payable outstanding dpo to evaluate our working capital performance 
dso is calculated as trade receivables  net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period 
dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
chargeback billings are the difference between a product s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 
fiscal year ended june  days sales outstanding days inventory on hand days payable outstanding 
table of contents the increase in dso in fiscal was driven by the impact of acquisitions and the increase in dpo was due to the timing of payments to vendors during the regular course of business 
the decrease in dso in fiscal was driven by focused efforts to manage customer accounts and reduce delinquency rates 
the significant improvement in dioh in fiscal was largely due to enhanced efficiency in our supply chain operations to reduce inventory requirements 
the change in dpo during fiscal was largely driven by a change in payable terms with a supplier in our pharmaceutical segment 
during fiscal  we deployed billion of cash on acquisitions  million on capital expenditures  million on dividends and million on share repurchases 
during fiscal  we received million in proceeds from sale of carefusion common stock 
during fiscal  we deployed million of cash on capital expenditures  million on dividends and million on share repurchases an additional million repurchased during fiscal settled during the first quarter of

in addition  we completed a debt tender resulting in the purchase of more than billion debt securities using cash of billion distributed to us from carefusion in connection with the spin off 
additionally  in october  we repaid our million floating rate notes at maturity 
the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal included million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 
although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation  permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal  state and local income tax obligations 
as a us parent company  we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 
the net cash provided by discontinued operations for fiscal of billion primarily reflected permanent financing obtained by carefusion prior to the spin off offset by million cash funding provided by us to carefusion pursuant to the spin off separation agreement 
net cash provided by used in discontinued operations for fiscal of million primarily related to the earnings and changes in working capital for carefusion 
ownership of shares of carefusion common stock during fiscal and  we disposed of million and million shares of carefusion common stock for cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
credit facilities and commercial paper our sources of liquidity include a billion revolving credit facility and a million committed receivables sales facility program 
during fiscal  we replaced our prior revolving credit facility with a new billion facility that expires in may and amended the committed receivables sales facility program to extend its term to november we also have a commercial paper program of up to billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june  our ability to access the commercial paper market is limited based on our current credit rating from moody s investor services 
our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio  as of any fiscal quarter end  of at least to and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to as of june   we were in compliance with these financial covenants

long term obligations as of june   we had total long term obligations of billion compared to billion at june  in december  we sold million of fixed rate notes due in a registered offering

we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for the repayment of million of our notes due february  capital expenditures capital expenditures during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to information technology projects and investments to improve the efficiency of our distribution facilities 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be generally in line with the level of spending in fiscal we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
fiscal capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 
dividends during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends of per share  or per share on an annualized basis  an increase of percent from fiscal on may   our board of directors approved a percent increase in our quarterly dividend to per share  or per share on an annualized basis  payable on july  to shareholders of record on july  on august   our board of directors approved our th consecutive regular quarterly dividend

we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength and credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history 
we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate 
we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 
the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year ended june  allowance for doubtful accounts in millions allowance as a percentage of customer receivables allowance as a percentage of revenue reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write offs in millions addition to allowance in millions a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables  sales type leases and finance notes receivables at june   would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate 
at this time  we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
inventories a substantial portion of inventories percent at june   and percent at june  is stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo last in  first out method  or market 
these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 

table of contents the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold  so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue 
using lifo  if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time  so our older inventory is held at a lower cost 
conversely  if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time  so our older inventory is held at a higher cost 
we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities 
accordingly  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
in fiscal and  we did not record any lifo reserve reductions 
the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost  using the fifo first in  first out method  or market 
if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities  the value of inventories would not have changed in fiscal or fiscal primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline  inventories at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june   and  respectively 
we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost 
inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  which were million at june   and million at june  we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition  including identifiable intangible assets 
when an acquisition involves contingent consideration  we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for trade names  customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets  discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows  and estimates of useful lives 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitions  including the contingent consideration related to the p healthcare acquisition 
goodwill and other intangibles purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
impairment testing involves a comparison of estimated fair value to the respective carrying amount 
if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations 
application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment  including but not limited to  the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
in fiscal  we identified four reporting 
table of contents units pharmaceutical segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division and yong yu division  medical segment  nuclear and pharmacy services division  and yong yu division 
fair values can be determined using market  income or cost based approaches 
our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of income based and market based approaches 
under the market based approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses  or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets 
under the income based approach  we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
to further confirm the fair value  we compare our aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal  and and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by percent  there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal  or vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business  our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes 
these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors  we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims 
we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  we periodically refine our estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience 
changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
approximately percent of the vendor reserve at june   pertained to the pharmaceutical segment  compared to percent at the end of fiscal the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements  and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies 
the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment 
we believe  however  that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
provision for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the following table presents information about our tax position fiscal year ended june  net deferred income tax assets in millions net deferred income tax liabilities in billions net loss and credit carryforwards included in net deferred income tax assets in millions net valuation allowance in millions against deferred tax assets this valuation allowance primarily relates to federal  state and international loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after applying the valuation allowances  we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by percent on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by million for fiscal share based compensation all share based payments to employees  including grants of options  are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model 
we believe the lattice model provides for better estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 
during fiscal and  we calculated separate option valuations for two separate groups of employees 
during fiscal  we calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees 
the groups were determined using similar historical exercise behaviors 
the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant years 
as required  the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks 
these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate  and commodity price related changes 
we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational  economic  and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by nature of our global operations  our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso  and thai baht 
transactional exposure our businesses transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
as part of our risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
the fiscal and fiscal analyses utilize a currency portfolio model  encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss 
these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program  which mitigates our businesses transactional exposure 
at each of june  and  we had hedged approximately percent of our businesses transactional exposures 
the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our businesses transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in millions net estimated transactional exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss translational exposure we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars  our functional currency 
we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure 
we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june  and the following table summarizes our businesses translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 

table of contents as part of our risk management program  we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical percent change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity we are exposed to market price changes for commodities  including oil based resins  cotton  latex  and diesel fuel 
we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
our forecasted commodity exposure as of june  increased from the prior year primarily as a result of contract adjustments with vendors  volatility of commodity prices  changes in purchasing volumes and changes in the mix of items we buy 
we have updated the prior year comparable commodity exposure to include all items meeting this criteria 
at june  and  we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical percent fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss we also have additional exposure to commodities through the purchase of finished goods and various other energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index 
we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities  including the items listed in the table above  is million to million as of june
