item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations during  disciplined cost management  strong customer sales and rate relief allowed ameren to overcome the financial impact of weak wholesale power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs 
ameren also returned its newly rebuilt taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility to service  installed major environmental controls at two coal fired plants  simplified its corporate structure by merging its illinois delivery utilities into a single company and by moving aerg under resources company  where ameren s other merchant generation assets reside  launched plans for growing its transmission business  and improved its safety and customer satisfaction performance 
in  ue and aic were authorized to increase rates 
ue obtained approval from the mopsc in may to increase electric rates by million annually and then in february to increase natural gas rates by million annually 
these rate increases have been necessary to recover the cost of infrastructure investments  higher fuel costs  and other operating expenses 
in november  aic received an order on rehearing from the icc on issues arising from the icc s amended order of may the rehearing order authorized an additional million annual rate increase  bringing the total annual revenue increase to million 
ongoing litigation exists surrounding appeals of certain aspects of ue s two most recent electric rate orders 
in february  the missouri office of public counsel moopc made a filing with the mopsc in which the moopc argued that a december  stay  granted by the circuit court of cole county  missouri circuit court  of ue s electric rate increase  as it applies to four industrial customers  should apply to all ue customers 
ue disagrees with the moopc s argument 
on december   the circuit court found that four industrial customers appealing ue s electric rate increase could pay the portions of their bills  representing increases from previously approved levels  into the circuit court s registry pending resolution of these appeals 
this effectively stayed the rate increases for those parties 
ue disagrees with the circuit court s ruling granting these industrial customers a stay 
at this time  ue does not believe any aspect of the and electric rate increases authorized by the and missouri electric rate orders are probable of refund to ue s customers 
ue and aic also have pending rate cases 
in september  ue filed for a million annual electric rate increase 
on february   other parties filed their initial testimony 
the staff of the mopsc recommended a rate increase of million to million 
a key reason that the staff s recommendation is considerably lower than ue s request is the staff s use of a return on equity range of to  compared to ue s request of 
while ue strongly disagrees with elements of the mopsc s staff and other parties initial recommendations  this case is still in its early stages with a decision not expected until july on february   aic filed an electric and natural gas delivery rate case with the icc requesting a million aggregate increase in annual revenues 
this request is based on a future test year ending december   with an icc decision expected in january the use of a future test year is designed to better match aic s rate levels to its expected costs  reducing regulatory lag and providing an improved opportunity to earn a fair return on investment 
in addition to these regulatory developments in ameren s state jurisdictions  ameren is awaiting action from ferc on its august filing for pre approval of supportive rate treatment for its proposed grand rivers regional electric transmission projects 
could be a pivotal year in environmental regulation 
the epa is scheduled to finalize its proposed catr  which is aimed at reducing emissions of so and so further  the epa is scheduled to propose requirements for retrofitting power plants with mact to reduce hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases  cooling water standards  and rules for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
these rules are expected to impose additional costs that could be substantial to ameren and  therefore  its customers 
ameren is continually evaluating these changing environmental standards for their impact on its power plants and is focused on meeting these requirements in the most cost effective manner possible 
ameren remains focused on earning fair returns on investments at its rate regulated utilities by seeking consistent  constructive regulatory outcomes  including mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag  like the use of a future test year in aic s pending electric and natural gas rate case filing 
further  ameren continues to focus on disciplined cost management  including aligning its spending with the level of rates authorized by its regulators 
in  ameren s rate regulated utilities narrowed the gap between their core earnings and their allowed returns on equity by almost three percent and by more than one percent on a weather normalized basis 
the projected return levels are expected to be below what is currently authorized and what ameren considers appropriate 
ameren believes its pending rate cases  cost control efforts and its ongoing work to improve its regulatory frameworks will allow its rate regulated utilities to further narrow the gap between earned and allowed returns 
ameren s merchant generation business continues to aggressively manage operating and capital costs so that this business remains stable during this period of low power prices and well positioned to benefit from an eventual expected power price recovery 
in  ameren s merchant generation business further lowered its cost structure to enhance its long term competitiveness 

table of contents earnings ameren reported net income of million  or cents per share  for compared with net income of million  or per share  in the main factor contributing to the decline in earnings in compared with was noncash goodwill and other asset impairment charges of million  or per share  recorded in related to ameren s merchant generation business 
these charges reflected a decline in the value of ameren s merchant generation business  principally as a result of sustained lower power prices and the potential enactment of more stringent environmental regulations 
ameren s earnings were also lower in  compared with  because of reduced merchant generation margins  as a result of lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs  and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
offsetting factors included higher electricity sales  which benefited from warmer summer weather  new utility rates in missouri and illinois  lower financing costs  and disciplined cost management 
liquidity cash flows from operations of billion were used to pay dividends to common stockholders of million and to fund capital expenditures of billion 
at december   ameren  on a consolidated basis  had available liquidity  in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities  of approximately billion  which was equivalent to the amount of available liquidity at december  capital spending capital expenditures decreased million in compared with the reduction was a result of fewer planned expenditures for the distribution system and power plant improvements  less expenditures required to repair severe storm damage  and the completion of power plant scrubber projects in the merchant generation business during and early from through  cumulative capital spending is projected to range between billion and billion 
much of this spending is at ameren s rate regulated utilities  including million at atx to expand its electric transmission assets 
this five year plan also includes significant investments in environmental projects  including the cost of installing scrubbers for two units of genco s newton plant and for two units of a ue plant 
in addition to existing laws and regulations governing our facilities  the epa is developing numerous new environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry 
these regulations could be particularly burdensome for certain companies  including ameren  ue and genco  that operate coal fired power plants 
significant new rules already proposed or promulgated within the past year include the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  revised ambient air quality standards for so and so emissions increasing the stringency of the existing ozone ambient air quality standard  the catr  which would require further reduction of so and so emissions from power plants  and a regulation governing coal ash impoundments 
within the next year  the epa is also expected to propose new regulations under the clean water act  that could require significant capital expenditures such as new water intake structures or cooling towers at our power plants  nsps and emission guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions applicable to new and existing electric generating units  and a mact standard for the control of hazardous air pollutants  such as mercury and acid gases from power plants 
such new regulations may be challenged with lawsuits  so the timing of their ultimate implementation is uncertain 
although many details of these future regulations are unknown  the combined effects of the new and proposed environmental regulations may result in significant capital expenditures over the next five to eight years for ameren  ue and genco
