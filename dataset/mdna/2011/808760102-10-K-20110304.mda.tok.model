item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop  distribute and license technology that accelerates learning by applying proven research on how the brain learns 
based on more than thirty years of neuroscience and cognitive research  our family of products improves brain fitness with technology based exercises that build the cognitive skills required to read and learn effectively 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  school districts and our company demonstrates the rapid and lasting gains achieved through participation in our products 
our products are marketed primarily to k schools in the us  to whom we sell through a direct sales force 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
since o ur inception  learners have used our products nearly three million times and over  schools have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services 
as of december   we had full time equivalent employees  compared to at december  business highlights we market our fast forword and reading assistant products primarily as a reading intervention solution for struggling and special education students and english language learners 
according to the us department of education usde  in  of fourth graders in the united states were not proficient in reading and performed below the basic level 
between and  there was no change in average th grade reading scores 
while our installed base is growing  the over  schools that have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services represent a small fraction of the approximately  k schools in the us states provide school districts with the majority of their funding  and those funds are also sometimes used to purchase our products 
additionally  federal education funds are a critical resource in helping school districts address the needs of the most challenged learners 
we believe that a significant proportion of our sales are funded by federal sources  particularly title i and idea special education grants 
during  school districts focused more attention on balancing operating budgets than on investing in tools to improve student achievement 
we experienced a substantial decline in booked sales in compared to  which we believe resulted from state budget pressures  uncertainty about future education policies  and an increasing trend toward using federal funds wherever possible to save teacher jobs and core programs rather than on supplemental programs focused on struggling learners 
in february  the center on budget and policy priorities estimated that for the current fiscal year  which began july  states had budget shortfalls totaling billion  or of budgets in those states 
the fact that schools have until september to spend remaining arra funds gives them the flexibility to wait for news regarding additional federal funding to save teacher jobs and developing education policies 
as a result  we believe that many school districts have delayed their purchasing decisions 
despite the recent attention school districts have paid to balancing their budgets  we believe our solutions will remain well positioned for federal title i  idea and competitive funding opportunities such as race to the top and school improvement grants  due to the continued emphasis on national achievement mandates and education reform 
company highlights our total revenue decreased by during as compared to our total booked sales decreased by during as compared to booked sales is a non gaap financial measure 
for more explanation on booked sales  see revenues below 
k booked sales decreased by during as compared to in  we closed five transactions in excess of  totaling million compared to such transactions totaling million in the million decline in transactions approximates the decline in our k business 
in  we expect that large deals will continue to drive our business with an expected significant contribution from scilearn enterprise  a new browser based platform hosted by the school district or learning institution 
we expect that our new platform enables us to expand our per student licensing option to the broader us k market  and we anticipate that in and later we will become less dependent on large deals 
we believe our new platform will enable us to significantly increase the number of smaller  more predictable transactions and recurring revenue 
non school sales  including private practice  international  direct to consumer  virtual schools and oem customers  increased by during as compared to operating expenses increased by during as compared to  and included a non cash impairment charge of million 

table of contents results of operations revenues the following table sets forth information relating to our revenues dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  change change products service and support total revenues versus product revenues decreased by million in compared to the decrease in from was primarily due to lower us k booked product sales as school districts continued to struggle with current and anticipated budget shortfalls 
our service and support revenue increased by million in compared to due to a higher renewal rate as we continue to focus on increasing product effectiveness and customer success 
for  our renewal rate increased to from in renewal rate is determined by dividing the number of school sites that renewed annual support and maintenance contracts by the total number of sites whose contracts were expiring in the period 
versus product revenues increased by million in compared to the increase in was primarily due to higher us k booked sales  which reflected the increased federal funding made available to schools by arra 
booked sales included one transaction for million for which we recognized product revenue of million in our service and support revenue was fairly consistent in compared to in we recognized oem revenue relating to the reading assistant operations that we did not repeat in this was offset primarily by an increase in the number of implementation service days delivered 
we believe that recurring revenue is an important measure of our operating performance 
in  the recurring portion of our revenue stream increased to million 
the following table sets forth information relating to our recurring revenues dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  products recurring non recurring total products service and support recurring non recurring total service and support total revenues recurring revenue as a of total revenue non recurring revenue as a of total revenue we derive recurring product revenue from subscription fees paid by us and international customers to access our applications 
recurring service and support revenue consists of support and maintenance for our software products and fees paid to access our web delivered reporting tools  progress tracker and reading progress indicator 

table of contents booked sales booked sales are a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if any of the requirements to recognize revenue are not met  the sale is recorded as deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be conside red in isolation from revenue  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  change change booked sales less revenue recognized other adjustments na na net increase decrease in deferred revenue na total deferred revenue end of period versus booked sales in the k sector decreased by to million in compared to million in as described above  state budget pressures caused many school districts to delay purchases during booked sales to the k sector for and were and  respectively  of total booked sales 
other adjustments in consists primarily of the recognition of deferred revenue and the related receivable for booked sales with free on board fob destination delivery terms that were not delivered until versus booked sales in the k sector increased by to million for compared to million in the flow of federal stimulus funds to individual school districts and the spending requirements linked to these funds put school districts in a better position to execute new purchases during the year 
one large transaction for approximately million was booked in  whereas the largest transaction booked in was for approximately million 
booked sales to the k sector in represented of total booked sales  compared to in other adjustments in consists primarily of booked sales with fob destination delivery terms that had not been delivered by year end  and therefore no deferred revenue o r receivable was recorded for these transactions 
we believe large booked sales  which we define as transactions totaling more than  are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in  we closed five transactions in excess of  compared to in and in in  school districts struggled with current and anticipated budget shortfalls  making it especially difficult to close large deals in our pipeline 
in  we benefited from the increased federal funding made available to schools by arra 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our booked sales arose from transactions over  large booked sales include volume and negotiated discounts but the percentage discount applicable to any given transaction will vary and the relative percentage of large booked sales and smaller booked sales in a given quarter may fluctuate 
because we discount product license fees but do not discount service and support fees  product booked sales and revenue are disproportionately affected by discounting 
we cannot predict the size and number of large transactions in the future 
booked sales to non school customers increased by to million in as compared to this increase reflects higher sales to private practice clinicians  international vars  consumers and virtual schools 
booked sales to non school customers decreased by in as compared to as a result of adverse economic conditions 
in addition  in we recorded oem booked sales of approximately million from the operations we purchased in our acquisition of jtt holdings inc d b a soliloquy learning soliloquy in january  compared with  in although the current economic and financial conditions  the temporary nature of federal stimulus funding  and federal  state and local budget pressures make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the k and non school markets 
however  achieving our growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control  including general economic conditions and the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
while federal funding for educa tion has grown steadily over the last few decades  the current level of federal spending and the federal deficit are likely to put pressure on all areas in the federal budget 
in addition  school district spending based on federal education stimulus funding is expected to decline after states continue to experience severe budget pressure from the adverse conditions in the job  housing and credit markets 
these conditions may continue to impact state education spending 

table of contents in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
gross profit and cost of revenues the following table sets forth information relating to our gross profits dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  gross profit on products gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit total gross profit margin versus the overall gross profit margin decreased by in compared to due to declines in the proportion of higher margin product revenue 
product revenues made up of total revenues in  compared to in product margins decreased by in over  mainly due to lower revenues over which fixed costs could be allocated 
service and support margins increased by in compared to  reflecting higher delivery of services in versus the overall gross profit margin increased by in compared to  mainly due to an increase in the proportion of higher margin product revenue 
product revenues made up of total revenues in  compared to in product margins in increased over  as proportionately lower royalty costs were partially offset by increased amortization expense arising from the intangible assets acquired from soliloquy and product costs associated with reading assistant 
service and support margins improved in compared to principally due to year over year price increases and cost savings resulting from more efficient delivery of services 
operating expenses the following table sets forth information relating to our expenses dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  change change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative impairment charge total operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due to lower commission and bonus expense as we did not meet our sales quotas for the million increase in from is mostly due to higher commission expense of approximately million as a result of the strong sales performance  partially offset by lower salary and benefit costs as a result of restructuring actions taken in january at december   we had quota bearing sales personnel compared to and at december  and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research  product development and product management activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
research and development expenses increased by million in compared to during  we continued to make critical investments in product development which resulted in increased headcount and consulting expenses 
we also incurred start up expenses for our new development office in shanghai  china 
the million decrease in from is primarily due to the capitalization of approximately million of development costs relating to our reading assistant expanded edition pro duct  partially offset by increased bonus expense of approximately million 
no development costs were capitalized in 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses remained unchanged for as compared to as a result of lower bonus expense offset by increased legal and consulting expenses related to our exploration of strategic alternatives in the area of mergers and acquisitions  which are presently not being pursued 
the million increase in compared to is primarily due to increases in bonus expenses of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
impairment charge impairment charge is attributable to the impairment of the long lived asset group associated with the reading assistant product line acquired through the purchase of soliloquy in we acquired soliloquy for its reading assistant product line that uses speech recognition technology to improve reading fluency 
we have seen success in both the us k and the international markets  as our partners successfully developed an effective english language learning curriculum around the product 
because of this success  we are making additional investments in reading assistant to replace the core technology and enable compatibility with our new web based platform 
due to this investment  we assessed whether the intangible asset group acquired from soliloquy  including s ome capitalized software development costs post acquisition  was impaired in accordance with the required accounting rules 
we used an income approach to determine if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group associated with reading assistant exceeded the carrying values of those assets 
as a result of this assessment  the carrying value of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows 
we then applied a fair value based test 
the fair value of the asset group was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows which rely on estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions include the discount rate  expected remaining useful life of the asset group and cash flows generated during the remaining useful life 
this analysis resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million in  which includes million related to capitalized software development costs 
income tax provision during  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million  and our valuation allowance increased by approximately million 
our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for the same period a year ago 
the decrease was primarily due to us losses not benefitted in the current year 
as of december   we had us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through as of december   we had us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
california state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million  and our valuation allowance decreased by approximately million 
our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for the same period a year ago 
the increase was due to pre tax income in during  we recorded an income tax provision of million 
this provision primarily consisted of a million increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as a result of the establishment of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate was 
this valuation allowance increase was the result of recording a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
after considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income  we concluded that we could no longer support a deferred tax asset balance 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards reflected above are limited due to ownership changes as provided in the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   compared to million at december  
table of contents we expect that during at least the next twelve months our cash flow from operations together with our current cash balances will be our primary source of liquidity and will be sufficient to provide the necessary funds for our operations and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash in our operations during the first half of the year and built cash in the second half 
this pattern results largely from our seasonally low sales in the first calendar quarter  which reflects our industry pattern  and the time needed to collect on sales made towards the end of the second quarter 
we expect that this pattern will continue  that we will use cash in operations during the first half of and that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operating re quirements during that period 
accomplishing this  however  will require us to meet specific booked sales targets in the k market 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our targets with respect to booked sales  revenues  expenses or operating results 
on february   we amended our existing revolving line of credit agreement with comerica bank 
the maximum that can be borrowed under the agreement is million 
the line expires on december  borrowing under the line of credit bears interest at a daily adjusting libor rate 
borrowings under the line are subject to reporting covenants requiring the provision of financial statements to comerica  and  as amended  financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of and positive net worth 
the agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit not to exceed million 
at december   we had an outstanding letter of credit for  there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at december   and we were i n compliance with all our covenants 
net cash used in operating activities for was million versus cash generated of million during the decrease was mainly the result of lower revenue resulting from a decrease in our booked sales 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million was used for the purchase of short term investments net of sales and maturities of million and million was used for capital spending primarily related to investments in research and development and new systems for back office operations 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million was used for purchase of property and equipment and million was used in development of our reading assistant product 
financing activities generated million in resulting from proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
financing activities for included the million borrowing offset by the million repayment on our line of credit as well and proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities in oakland  california 
the minimum lease payment was approximately  per month through from through the end of the lease  the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also have a lease agreement for our tucson  arizona office through may at an average rent of approximately  per month 
in early  we entered into a lease for our reading assistant operations in waltham  massachusetts for approximately  square feet at an average monthly rent of approximately  that expires in september following the closure of the waltham office in december  we have sublet this property through the end of the lease at a monthly rent of approximately  in june  we signed a lease for an office in shanghai  china for  square feet at a rate of approximately  per month through may to be used for research and development 
we also make royalty payments to the institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year 

table of contents the following table summarizes our obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands and thereafter total contractual obligations operating lease obligations net of sublease income minimum royalty obligations total our purchase order commitments at december  are not material 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the rules governing revenue recognition for software companies 
these rules provide specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of these rules requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
in cases where we grant extended payment terms to school customers  we determine if the fixed or determinable fee criterion is met by reference to the customer s specific funding sources  esp ecially where the payment terms extend into the customer s next fiscal year 
if we determine that the fixed or determinable fee criterion is not met at the inception of the arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until the payments become due 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are required to exercise ju dgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
multiple contracts with the same customer are generally accounted for as separate arrangements except in cases where contracts are so closely related that they are effectively part of a single arrangement 

table of contents product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
subscription and term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally month to month or a term of three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  implementation  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
if an arrangement includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the fees for the software license and the services using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting standards for software and service companies 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional se rvices employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal and state operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
the estimated expected stock price volatility increased from in to in and increased again to in our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the options is based upon our historical experience over the expected life of the options 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate has also changed from in to in to in  based on our experience of actual forfeiture rates 
stock compensation expense may be adjusted in the future if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our current estimates 

table of contents the requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards 
we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows million during  million during  million during  and million during these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of december  we expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods 
capitalization of software development costs and website development costs as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies to the financial statements  in and we capitalized certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and will amortize the costs over the estimated lives of the related products 
in and  the company capitalized million and million of costs  respectively  relating to new products that had reached technological feasibility 
in  costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility for new projects were not significant and were charged to research and development expense 
the rules that govern how development costs are accounted for can have a major impact on our reported financial results 
significant judgment is required in assessing whether and when products have reached technological feasibility 
we are also required to use judgment to estimate the net realizable value of the asset by projecting future revenues and cash flows expected to be generated by the products  in order to determine whether the unamortized cost exceed the net realizable value 
moreover  any future changes to our software product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our financial results 
we also capitalize costs related to internal use software and web site application  infrastructure development and content development 
in each case  the software or website is for internal needs  and we do not plan to market the software externally 
for the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million of software and web site development costs 
for the years ended december  and  we capitalized approximately million and million of software and web site development costs  respectively 
the company evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  estimates of future cash flows are used to test the recoverability of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized 
in  we determined that capitalized software development costs relating to the reading assistant asset group was impaired 
see long lived assets below for further discussion 
in late  we determined that we needed to completely redesign our brainspark website and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of million 
significant judgment is required in evaluating which costs are eligible for capitalization and whether any impairment exists 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in december  we identified an impairment indicator related to the core technology intangible asset acquired as a result of the purchase of soliloquy in in  we decided to make additional investments in the reading assistant product line to replace the core technology and enable compatibility with our new web based platform 
as a result  we determined it was necessary to assess the recoverability of the asset group associated with generating reading assistant cash flows  which includes some capitalized software development costs post acquisition 
we used an income approach to determine if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceeded the carrying values of those assets 
as a result of this assessment  the carrying value of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows 
we then performed an analysis to determine the fair value of the asset group  which was determined using the expected present value of future cash flows which are based on estimates  assumptions and management s judgments 
these include the forecast of future cash flows related to the asset group  the discount rate used in discounting those cash flows  and the expected remaining useful life of the asset group 
this analysis resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million in  which includes million related to capitalized software development costs 
the impairment charge was allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of the asset group 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
our exposure to market risk is related to our short term investments in federal agency and corporate bonds at december  we had no investments subject to market risk at december  interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we invest in a variety of securities  which primarily consist of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities and other debt securities of domestic corporations 
due to the nature of these investments and relatively short duration of the underlying securities  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our inve stment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
during the year ended december   a appreciation or depreciation in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income or the fair value of our marketable securities 
foreign currency exchange risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and  therefore  the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
we are directly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent such changes affect our expenses related to our foreign assets and liabilities 
our only exposure in regard to our foreign assets and liabilities is with our chinese subsidiary whose functional currency is the chinese renminbi
