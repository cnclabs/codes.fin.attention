presentation of financial and operating data we operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last tuesday in december 
fiscal years and were weeks in length  while the fourth quarters for those years were weeks in length 
fiscal year was weeks in length and  as such  the fourth quarter of fiscal year was weeks in length 
long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing markets and new domestic or international markets 
domestically  we will remain focused primarily on mid sized markets where we believe a significant demand for our restaurants exists because of population size  income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base 
our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by many factors beyond our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth 
we moderated our restaurant development plans for and due  in part  to increasing restaurant development costs  particularly during to throughout  we focused on reducing our average capital investment for developing our prototype restaurant by making building design modifications and lowering site work costs 
additionally  we have opened two restaurants using a new prototype  which is slightly smaller than our typical prototype 
our average capital investment for 
table of contents texas roadhouse restaurants opened during  including pre opening expenses  was million  which is a decrease of approximately million from our million average in based on the decreased restaurant development costs and improved sales in  we have increased our restaurant development plans for to approximately restaurants from restaurants in we continue to focus on driving sales and decreasing restaurant development costs in order to further increase our restaurant development in the future 
we may  at our discretion  add franchise restaurants  domestically and or internationally  primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with the texas roadhouse or other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions 
in conjunction with this strategy  we signed our first international franchise agreement on april  for the development of texas roadhouse restaurants in eight countries in the middle east over the next ten years  the first of which is expected to open in late additionally  in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with a casual dining restaurant operator in china for minority ownership in three non texas roadhouse restaurants yet to be opened 
we may also look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
additionally  from time to time  we will evaluate potential mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts 
of the restaurants we owned and operated at the end of  operated as texas roadhouse restaurants  while three operated under the name of aspen creek 
all of our planned restaurant growth in will be texas roadhouse restaurants 
maintaining and or improving restaurant level profitability 
we plan to maintain  or possibly increase  restaurant level profitability through a combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management 
in  our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased and  respectively 
the growth in these measures was primarily due to higher guest traffic counts  which we believe is due to our continued focus on encouraging repeat visits by our guests by not sacrificing any operational standards relating to our quality of food and service  along with an improvement in the overall economy 
we also continue to drive various localized marketing programs in order to attract new guests and increase the frequency of visits of our existing guests 
additionally  we believe we have been conservative with menu price increases 
from through  average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales declined primarily as a result of lower guest traffic counts and lower increases in average guest check 
we believe the lower guest traffic counts across these periods were primarily attributable to a general softening of the overall consumer environment  consistent with the casual dining industry  as a whole  experiencing lower guest traffic counts 
during this four year span  consumer casual dining restaurant demand was negatively impacted by increasing unemployment rates and higher menu prices resulting from inflationary pressures such as certain state minimum and tipped wage increases  along with higher gasoline prices 
we believe all of these pressures negatively impacted guest traffic counts for us  as well as the industry 
in addition to lower guest traffic counts from through  we have experienced declining year over year growth in our per person average check since fiscal year for two reasons 
first  we have implemented fewer and smaller menu price increases largely due to the general softening of the overall economy over the last four to five years 
second  we have experienced guests shifting their selections to lower priced menu items and or purchasing fewer alcoholic beverages over the last few years 
as a result  we have seen less year over year growth in our per person average check  despite the menu price increases we have implemented 
leveraging our scalable infrastructure 
to support our growth  we continue to make investments in our infrastructure 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments in our infrastructure including information systems  real estate  human resources  legal  marketing and 
table of contents operations 
historically  general and administrative costs have increased at a slower growth rate than our revenue 
whether we are able to continue leveraging our infrastructure will depend  in part  on our new restaurant and comparable restaurant sales growth rates going forward 
returning capital to shareholders 
we continue to look at opportunities to return capital to our shareholders  including through the repurchases of common stock and the payment of dividends 
our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our common stock through open market transactions 
we made no purchases of our common stock during the weeks ended december  on february   our board of directors authorized the payment of a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
this payment will be distributed on april   to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  the declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors  and any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  earnings  financial condition  applicable covenants under our credit facility and other contractual restrictions  or other factors deemed relevant

we have implemented certain menu pricing increases to partially offset impacts from higher operating costs and other inflationary pressures 
the following table summarizes our menu pricing actions for the periods shown 
increased menu pricing april may june january february as some guests are purchasing fewer alcoholic beverages and or shifting their selections to lower priced menu items  average guest check has not increased in line with the menu price increases above

additionally  lower workers compensation claims experience resulted in lower year over year workers compensation expense for we anticipate our labor costs will continue to be pressured by inflation  driven by higher wage rates partially due to federal and state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates 
these increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments

the amount and timing of any potential future charges  however  is difficult to predict 
in  impairment and closure expenses included million associated with the impairment of goodwill  reacquired franchise rights and other long lived assets primarily building and equipment 
the impairment charges were primarily triggered by our analysis of historical results and projected future cash flows at five underperforming restaurants 
after performing tests for impairment  it was determined that goodwill  reacquired franchise rights and certain other long lived assets associated with these five restaurants were impaired two of which were fully impaired and  accordingly  we recorded impairment charges related to these assets of million  million and million  respectively

the longmont lease expires in may  the everett lease expires in february  the montgomeryville lease expires in march  the fargo lease expires in july and the logan lease expires on august as the fair value of these guarantees is not considered significant  no liability value has been recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measures and disclosures accounting standards update asu in january  the fasb issued asu which amends asc  fair value measures and disclosures 
asu no 
amends the asc to require disclosure of transfer into and out of level 
table of contents and level fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
the changes as a result of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  our fiscal year  except for requirements related to level disclosures  which are effective for annual and interim period beginning after december  our fiscal year 
this guidance requires new disclosures only  and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate restaurants  cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment 
our evaluation requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life  which can be for a period of over years 
in the estimation of future cash flows  we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
if assets are determined to be impaired  we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
we generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal  if available 
when fair value is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows  the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
we also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we have assigned goodwill to the reporting unit  which we consider to be the individual restaurant level 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare 
table of contents it to its carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit may be based on several valuation approaches including capitalization of earnings  discounted cash flows  comparable public company market multiples and comparable acquisition market multiples 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the valuation approaches used to determine fair value are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgment and assumptions about our appropriate revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and comparable company and acquisition market multiples 
in estimating the fair value using the discounted cash flows or the capitalization of earnings method we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods  expectations of future sales growth and terminal value 
assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
when developing these key judgments and assumptions  we consider economic  operational and market conditions that could impact our fair value 
the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
however  estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only our reasonable expectations regarding future developments 
if the estimates used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
at december   we had reporting units  primarily at the restaurant level  with allocated goodwill of million 
the average amount of goodwill associated with each reporting unit is million with six reporting units having goodwill in excess of million 
based on our estimate of fair value  we are currently monitoring five restaurants with total goodwill of million 
since we determine the fair value of goodwill at the restaurant level  any significant decreases in cash flows at these restaurants or others could trigger an impairment charge in the future 
the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment test 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  employment practices liability and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below employment practices liability workers compensation general liability property we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by management  a third party administrator and or an actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
estimates of claims reserves related to workers compensation and general liability are discounted using a discount rate of approximately at december  resulting in a discount of million 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of 
table of contents historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  starting in fiscal  we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our employee healthcare insurance program and purchase insurance for individual claims under the program that exceed  income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb asc fasb asc requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
effects of inflation we believe inflation has had a negative effect on our operations during the past few years as we have not substantially offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu  increasing menu prices and or making other adjustments 
whether we are able and or choose to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what  if any  extent inflation affects our operations in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
our options for the rate are the base rate  which is the higher of the issuing bank prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus an applicable margin 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
should interest rates based on these borrowings increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by million 
on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  which started on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
on january   we entered into another interest rate swap  starting february   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 
table of contents month libor rate for a term ending on january   effectively resulting in a fixed rate libor component of the million notional amount 
by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
our counterparty in the interest rate swap is jp morgan chase  na many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and cheese  and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for other commodities  we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating market prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon two to four vendors 
while we maintain relationships with additional suppliers  if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
