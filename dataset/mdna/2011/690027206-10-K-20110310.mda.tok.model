the liquidity and capital resources section provides a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview outdoor channel holdings  inc is an entertainment and media company 
we are organized into two operating segments  outdoor channel or toc and production services 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
an overview of our two operating segments follows 
the outdoor channel the outdoor channel is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
toc revenues consist primarily of advertising fees  including those from advertisements aired on outdoor channel and fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel  and subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
our advertising revenue for toc consists of advertising bought on our cable network and advertising revenue related to ads placed on our website  outdoorchannel 
com 
advertising revenues are generally driven by audience delivery  which in turn are determined by our subscriber base and the ratings our programs achieve in those homes 
a portion of toc s advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts at the time we enter into such contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on our nielsen ratings from prior years 
if after running the advertising we determine we did not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue  we then provide the advertiser with additional advertising time to reach the aggregate minimum audience that we guaranteed and then recognize such revenue at that time 
any estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
during  toc s nielsen reported male demographic ratings for our program offerings have declined from year ago levels which have had an adverse impact on our ability to increase our reported advertising revenues for toc 
the continued growth of our advertising revenues will  to a certain extent  be dependent on the growth of our audience viewing and subscriber base  as well as the general health of the advertising marketplace 
for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million subscriber homes compared to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month  and for march nielsen s estimate was at million subscribers 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
the estimate regarding outdoor channel s subscriber base is made by nielsen media research and is theirs alone  and does not represent our opinions  forecasts or predictions 
it should not be implied that we endorse nor necessarily concur with such information  simply due to our reference to or distribution of their estimate 
although we realize nielsen s estimate is typically greater than the number of subscribers on which a network is paid by the service providers  we are currently experiencing a greater difference in these two different numbers of subscribers than we would expect 
we anticipate this percentage difference to decrease as we grow our total subscriber base  and we have seen it decrease over the past year 
there can be no assurances that nielsen will continue to report growth of its estimate of our subscribers and in fact at some point nielsen may even report additional declines in our subscriber estimate 
if that were to happen  we could suffer a reduction in advertising revenue 

table of contents we are pursuing subscriber growth by utilizing various means including offering lower per subscriber fees for broader distribution and payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees among other tactics 
such launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense as other direct costs 
if we are unsuccessful with these subscriber growth tactics  our net subscriber fee revenue may decrease over the short term future 
also  we often gain or lose subscribers when our distributors decide to realign their programming lineups and offerings 
while we are programmed in high definition format hd  our hd signal is only carried on a subset of our overall subscriber base 
we currently have approximately million hd subscriber homes 
we are continuing our efforts to increase the carriage of our hd signal as we deem this to be an important competitive feature 
we also continue to invest in programming and advertising and marketing expenses as we believe we need to invest in our programming brand given the increased viewing alternatives  including competitors with similar outdoor themed programming 
we increased expenses in these areas in compared to and expect they will continue to increase in we also have invested significant resources to build our outdoorchannel 
com website which has seen the highest revenue gains of any component of our ad revenue and expect that we will continue to make investments in this area to support material revenue potential for our online operations 
beginning in the second half of we were able to begin reducing certain selling  general and administrative costs  especially those related to our public company costs  such as our audit fees  our tax advisory and compliance fees and our sox compliance costs 
we will continue to focus on areas to reduce sg a expenses in production services production services is comprised of our wholly owned subsidiary  winnercomm  inc  which in turn wholly owns cablecam  llc and skycam  llc 
these businesses are involved in the production  development and marketing of sports programming and aerial camera systems 
production services revenues include revenue from sponsorship and advertising fees from company ad inventory  revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts  revenue from camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting fees 
since our acquisition of winnercomm and its aerial camera business in january  we have been focused on eliminating low margin production business and returning the production services unit to profitability 
we have reduced staff levels at our production services unit  primarily in our tulsa production offices  on three different occasions  the most recent being in june in addition to focusing on higher margin production business  we expect our production services unit to increasingly be used in producing high quality programming for toc 
in  for example  our winnercomm unit of our production services segment generated of its revenue from toc programming and services as compared to in we expect our intercompany revenue at winnercomm to increase to above in we continue to explore areas to reduce sg a costs at our winnercomm unit to improve its profitability 
at our aerial camera unit within the production services segment  a significant portion of our revenue comes from services rendered to national television networks for nfl and college football games 
the nfl is currently in a contract negotiation with its players association and there is a chance that an agreement will not be reached and  accordingly  the nfl season may be disrupted 
if this happens  our aerial camera unit will experience a shortfall of revenues and profits in calendar college football would be unaffected by any nfl strike or lock out 
both toc and our production services segments generate a higher proportion of their revenue and operating income in the second half of our fiscal year due to higher viewed hunting programming which coincides with the fall hunting season at toc and to football driven revenues at our production services unit 
at toc  we expect a trend that started two years ago to continue where endemic advertisers and sponsors of our hunting programs move more 
table of contents of their advertising expenditures from the fourth calendar quarter to the third calendar quarter  which has made our third quarter advertising revenues at toc higher than our fourth quarter revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as customer retention patterns  allowance for bad debts  useful lives of assets  asset valuations including cash flow projections  recoverability of assets  potential unasserted claims under contractual obligations  income taxes  reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated balance sheet and reported amount of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
accordingly  actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition toc generates revenue through advertising fees from advertisements and infomercials aired on outdoor channel  fees paid by outside producers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel and from subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor 
production services revenue includes revenue from sponsorship and advertising fees from company ad inventory  revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts  revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting fees 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
costs incurred prior to completion and delivery are reflected as prepaid production costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
advances of payments prior to completion and delivery are shown as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
revenue from each event is based on an agreed upon contracted amount plus allowed expenses 
revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting services is recognized upon the completion of services 
commission revenue from the marketing of program advertising  and commercial air time is recognized when the advertising or commercial air time occurs 
in the normal course of business  the company acts as or uses an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties 
certain transactions are recorded on a gross or net basis depending on whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction or acting as an agent in the transaction 
we serve as the principal in transactions in which we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership and  accordingly  record revenue on a gross basis 
for those transactions in which we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership  we are considered an agent in the transaction and  accordingly  record revenue on a net basis 
we record revenue when our commission is earned 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an 
table of contents accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
revenues recognized do not exceed the total of the cash payments received and cash received in excess of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated or improved  whether due to customer specific or general economic conditions  we make appropriate adjustments to the allowance 
all bad debt expense for the company is included in selling  general and administrative expense 
valuation of goodwill we currently have two reporting units  toc and production services 
the production services reporting unit consists of our winnercomm  cablecam and skycam businesses which were acquired on january  all of the company s goodwill is attributed to our toc reporting unit 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  pursuant to a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
during  the company relied on the guideline company method under the market approach to determine the fair value of our toc reporting unit 
in  the income approach replaced the market approach methodology utilized in the previous year as the company believes that the income approach is a more accurate basis for measuring the fair values of a public company with multiple reporting units 
if the fair value of any of our reporting units exceeds the carrying values of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to any of our reporting units exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
during the second quarter of  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from the last day of its third quarter september to the first day of its fourth quarter october 
the company selected this date to perform its annual goodwill impairment test because it believes the new date is preferable in these circumstances as it better aligns the timing of the impairment test with the company s long range planning process  giving the company more visibility 
in addition  the october test date is preferable because it allows additional time for management to plan and execute its review of the completeness and accuracy of the impairment testing process 
the annual impairment analysis performed as of september  and  respectively  did not indicate any impairment 
in accordance with this change  the company conducted its annual impairment test as of october  the annual impairment analysis performed as of september  did not indicate any impairment 
the company performed an annual impairment test as of october  and again at october  and neither test indicated any impairment 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units is based on our projection of revenues  cost of services  other expenses and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the valuations employ present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of our annual assessment date were a expected cash flow for the period from to plus a terminal year  b a discount rate of  which is based on marketplace participant expectations  and c a debt free net cash flow long term growth rate of which is based on expected levels of growth for nominal gdp and inflation 

table of contents as of october   if forecasted debt free net cash flow growth had been lower than estimated  sensitivity calculations indicate that goodwill attributed to toc would not be impaired 
as of october   if the discount rate applied in our analysis had been higher than estimated  sensitivity calculations indicate that goodwill attributed to toc would not be impaired 
as of october   the company would have been required to perform the second step of the implied fair value analysis had the projected cash flow growth rate been less than negative four percent 
changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment  including expected future cash flows and discount rate  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units in the future and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
prepaid programming costs we produce a portion of the programming we air on our channel in house and amortize the related costs of production over the expected airings of the produced shows 
at any given time  we have unamortized costs for programming that are carried on our balance sheet as prepaid programming costs 
these unamortized costs will be charged to programming expense when the related programs air and the related advertising revenue is recognized 
at the time it is determined that a program will not likely air  we charge to programming expense any remaining unamortized costs recorded in prepaid programming costs 
share based compensation we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense is recognized over the service period  based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we account for stock options granted to non employees using the fair value method 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a 
table of contents variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics  among others a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or the right to receive benefits from the entity  that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
under this guidance  ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity are required 
this guidance became effective for us on january  and did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides for a new methodology for establishing the fair value for a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
when vendor specific objective or third party evidence for deliverables in a multiple element arrangement cannot be determined  an enterprise is required to develop a best estimate of the selling price of separate deliverables and to allocate the arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance will be effective for us on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that expands the required disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance provides for new disclosures requiring the company to i disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and ii present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the company to i determine each class of assets and liabilities based on the nature and risks of the investments rather than by major security type and ii for each class of assets and liabilities  disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both level and level fair value measurements 
this guidance became effective for the company on january   except for the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements  which is effective for us on january   and did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the guidance pertaining to the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides additional guidance on when to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
under this guidance  an entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance will be effective for us on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
consolidated results of operations overview on january  we acquired winnercomm see note of the consolidated financial statements and began operating in two segments  toc and production services

it is possible that our subscriber fee revenue will be adversely affected by these accruals in until we resolve ongoing discussions with certain of our distributors

the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then amortized to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
the anticipated airing schedule has typically been over or quarters that generally does not extend over more than years 
as the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is prospectively adjusted accordingly 
at the time we determine a program is unlikely to air or re air  we amortize programming expense with the remaining associated cost recorded in prepaid programming 
we do not make any further expense or asset adjustments if in subsequent periods demand brings episodes to air that had previously been fully expensed  rather  we consider such events when we review our expected airings prospectively 
satellite transmission fees for were million  a decrease of  or  compared to million for the decrease in satellite transmission fees was primarily due to lower monthly fees associated with our new satellite agreement which became effective in june production and operations costs for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the increase in costs for relates primarily to the inclusion of costs associated with our production services segment

the effective income tax rate was approximately and for and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the change in pre tax earnings from operations and the factors described above for net income loss our resulting net loss for was  compared to net income of million for liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash in our operating activities in  compared to million in  and had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase in cash flows from operating activities in compared to the same period in was due primarily to decreases in operating expenses with our toc segment and a decrease in our operating loss at our production services segment 
net working capital increased to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to the reasons stated above 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used of million for the increase in cash provided by investing activities related principally to the proceeds from the net sale of short term available for sale securities and a decrease in capital expenditures for fixed asset replacements 
the cash used for related primarily to the net purchase of short term available for sale securities  our acquisition of winnercomm and capital expenditures for fixed asset replacements 
as of december   we held million of auction rate securities classified as long term assets 
auction rate securities are investment vehicles with long term or perpetual maturities which pay interest monthly at current market rates reset through a dutch auction 
beginning in february  the majority of auctions for these types of securities failed due to liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets 
our auction rate securities followed this trend and experienced multiple failed auctions due to insufficient investor demand 
as there is a limited secondary market for auction rate securities  we have been unable to convert our positions to cash 
we do not anticipate being in a position to liquidate all of these investments until there is a successful auction or the security issuer redeems their security  and accordingly  have reflected our investments in auction rate securities as non current assets on our balance sheet 
due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these investments 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves for similar securities  market rates of returns  and the expected term of each security 
based on these models  we recorded an unrealized gain on our pps of in as a result of the lack of liquidity in the pps market  we have an unrealized loss on our pps of  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we deemed the loss to be temporary because we do not plan to sell any of the pps prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value and  at this time  do not deem it probable that we will receive less than of the principal and accrued interest 
in making assumptions of required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
our auction rate security investments continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  are fully collateralized by underlying financial instruments primarily closed end preferred and municipalities and have maintained at least a credit ratings despite the failure of the auction process 
we believe that based on the company s current cash  cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities balances at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow  financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations 

table of contents we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
cash used by financing activities was million in compared to cash used of million for the increase of million in cash used by financing activities relates to a special one time million dividend 
per share common share paid in december and an increase in the purchase and retirement of treasury stock as employees used stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares  net of a million reduction in the purchase of stock in connection with the stock repurchase plan

on december   our board of directors declared a special one time dividend of 
per share of common stock to be paid in cash on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  as of december   we had sufficient cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations to meet our short term cash flow requirements 
management believes that our existing cash resources  including cash on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations at current levels and anticipated capital requirements through at least december  to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance our working capital requirements or our desire to expand operations beyond current levels  we could seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available if needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations employment agreements total operating lease obligations principally relate to satellite lease commitments for delivery of our signal and office leases 
purchase obligations relate to purchase commitments made for the acquisition of programming  advertising and promotions  including magazine advertisements and radio show sponsorships  talent agreements  equipment or software maintenance  ratings and research services and other operating purchases

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of  and  respectively 
at december   all of our securities were auction rate securities with long term maturities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the amount of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we currently do not have significant transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we currently have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
