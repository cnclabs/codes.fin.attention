overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes that may be safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic profiles 
our most advanced program involves developing proprietary formulations of injectable recombinant human insulin  or rhi  designed to be more rapid acting than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs presently used to treat patients with type and type diabetes 
we  therefore  refer to these reformulations as our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations 
in addition to our rhi based formulations  we are using our formulation technology to develop new ultra rapid acting formulations of insulin analogs 
these insulin analog based formulations generally use the same or similar excipients as our rhi based formulations and are designed to be more rapid acting than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs  but they may present characteristics that are different from those offered by our rhi based formulations 
an earlier rhi based formulation known as linjeta tm and previously referred to as viaject was the subject of a new drug application  or nda  that we submitted to the fda in december in october  the fda issued a complete response letter stating that the nda for linjeta tm could not be approved in its present form and that we should conduct two pivotal phase clinical trials with our preferred commercial formulation of linjeta tm prior to re submitting the nda 
based upon the complete response letter and subsequent feedback the fda provided to us at a meeting in january  we decided to study newer rhi based formulations in earlier stage clinical trials 
the objective of these clinical trials was to determine whether one or more of our newer rhi based formulations was likely to offer a combination of pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic  stability and injection site tolerability characteristics that is preferable to the linjeta tm formulation that was the subject of the complete response letter 
in august  we completed patient visits and analyzed top line data from the first phase clinical trial of two rhi based formulations that we refer to as biod and biod the trial was a single center  randomized  double blind  three period crossover trial in subjects with type diabetes 
each study drug was administered on separate days 
the objective of the trial was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and injection site toleration of biod and biod  as compared to the insulin analog marketed as humalog 
pharmacodynamics were assessed using the euglycemic clamp method 
local injection site discomfort was measured after each test injection with a mm visual analog scale  or vas  and with additional questions pertaining to injection site toleration 
based on our review of the of the data from our clinical trial of biod and biod  as well as the results of a similar clinical trial conducted by oregon health science university in which biod and biod were administered by insulin pump in lieu of subcutaneous injection  we have determined that further formulation work is needed before advancing an rhi based formulation into phase clinical testing 
while biod and biod were more rapidly absorbed than humalog  and while both formulations were well tolerated by patients  the relative serum insulin peak levels were lower and the decline following peak was slower with biod and biod compared to humalog  and the overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of biod and biod did not meet our target product profile 
in december  we selected a new rhi based formulation to study in a phase clinical trial 
we plan to begin this clinical trial in the first calendar quarter of in addition  we continue to develop several ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations to determine their potential pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic  tolerability and stability characteristics 
in support of this development effort  we have entered into an agreement with a pharmaceutical company to acquire a limited supply of an insulin analog for use as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in our proprietary insulin analog based formulations 
we have agreed to preserve for the pharmaceutical company  for a limited period of time  the right to license our insulin analog based technology on an exclusive basis 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through our initial public offering in may  a follow on offering in february  registered direct offerings in august and may and  prior to these public offerings  private placements of convertible preferred stock and other securities 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
the deficit accumulated during the development stage is attributable primarily to our research and development activities and non cash charges for accretion of beneficial conversion rights and deemed dividend warrants and share based compensation 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
we expect to continue to generate significant losses as we continue to develop our product candidates 
to date  we have not generated revenues and we expect to incur operating losses as we continue our efforts to develop and commercialize ultra rapid acting formulations of rhi and insulin analogs 
as of september   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of september  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the first half of the calendar year 
we believe that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by raising additional capital from the capital markets  registered direct offerings  proceeds derived from grants and collaborations  including  but not limited to  upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties 
we can give no assurances that such funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
as a result of implementing a reduction in force in january  research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended september  decreased as we focused our efforts on conducting preclinical studies and phase clinical trials to study biod and biod and other new formulations of rhi or insulin analogs in order to determine our preferred development  clinical and regulatory program for our ultra rapid acting formulations 
over the longer term  however  we anticipate these expenses will increase as we conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials to determine whether and how to advance the clinical development of and seek regulatory approval for an rhi or insulin analog based formulation  conduct preclinical studies with earlier stage product candidates and make limited investments in order to advance proof of concept formulations  and purchase insulin analogs and other materials to support our research and development activities 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects and our drug development program for our ultra rapid acting rhi and insulin analog based formulations  including the original linjeta tm formulations and biod and biod to date  we have not tracked expenses related to our product development activities on a project or program basis 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of research and development expenses that we incurred with respect to each of our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
however  substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our ultra rapid acting insulin program 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
year ended september  december  inception to september  in thousands research and development expenses preclinical expenses manufacturing expenses clinical regulatory expenses total the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the success of our product candidates  particularly our proprietary formulations of injectable insulin that are designed to be absorbed more rapidly than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs presently used to treat patients with type and type diabetes  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  the progress  timing or success of our research  development and clinical programs  including any resulting data analyses  our ability to conduct pivotal clinical trials and other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize a proprietary formulation of injectable insulin  our ability to develop and commercialize rhi or insulin analog based formulations that may be associated with less injection site discomfort than the formulation that is the subject of the complete response letter we received from the fda  the cost to develop an insulin pen for use with our product candidates and the clinical development program required to support use in insulin pumps  the costs of pre commercialization activities  if any  the costs associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of an ultra rapid acting rhi or insulin analog based formulation or any of our other product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including share based compensation expenses  in our executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ending september  will remain substantially the same as in the fiscal year ended september  as we continue to focus our efforts on preclinical studies and phase clinical trials 
over the longer term  however  these expenses could increase if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into later stage clinical trials  including phase pivotal trials 
restricted cash restricted cash of thousand as of september  and thousand as of september  was held in a money market account with a bank to secure a credit card purchasing agreement utilized to facilitate employee travel and certain ordinary purchases 
marketable securities in accordance with accounting standard codification  or asc  topic  investments in debt and equity securities  our marketable securities were classified as available for sale 
in accordance with that standard  these securities are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we regularly evaluate the performance of these investments individually for impairment  taking into consideration the investment  volatility and current returns 
if a determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the related securities are written down to their estimated fair value due to the short term need for funds 
we sold all of our marketable securities in march and modified our investment strategy to primarily invest in money market accounts 
the decision eliminated investment fees and yielded a higher return 
as of september  and  we had million and of marketable securities investments  respectively 
pre launch inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit cannot be reasonably determined  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  we expensed million and million  respectively  of costs associated with the purchase of recombinant human insulin  as research and development expense after it passed quality control inspection and transfer of title occurred 
as a result of receiving the fda s complete response letter with respect to our linjeta tm nda  we continue to expense pre launch inventory as research and development 
the pre launch inventory treatment will be reevaluated if we complete phase clinical trials of a product candidate for which the inventory is applicable and we file a related nda or nda supplement for review by the fda 
warrant liability in may  we completed a registered direct offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock   shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants will expire on may   five years from the issuance date of may  in the event we enter into a merger or change of control transaction  the holders of the warrants will be entitled to receive consideration as if they had exercised the warrant immediately prior to such transaction  or they may require us to purchase the unexercised warrants at the black scholes value as defined in the warrant of the warrant on the date of such transaction 
as per the terms of the warrants  the holders have up to days following any such transaction to exercise this right 
as a result of this provision  we recognize the warrants as liabilities at their fair value on each reporting date 
because the warrants issued in the may financing do not contain a repricing provision  we are using the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
the black scholes valuation model takes into account  as of the valuation date  factors including the current exercise price  the expected life of the warrant  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the term of the warrant 
using this model  we recorded an initial warrant liability of million as of the initial warrant issuance date 
the significant assumptions by the model were warrants and common stock outstanding  remaining terms of the warrants  the common stock price of per share  the warrant exercise price of per share  a risk free interest rate of and an expected volatility rate of 
the liability is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized currently in the statements of operations under the caption adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
in august  we completed a registered direct offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of per share 
in december  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share per the terms of the warrant 
in may  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share per the terms of the warrants in connection with our may financing 
these warrants were measured at fair value using the monte carlo simulation method which is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of our and our peer group s future expected stock prices and minimizes standard error 
the monte carlo simulation method takes into account  as of the valuation date  factors including the current exercise price  the expected life of the warrant  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  the risk free interest rate for the term of the warrant and the probability of a change of control 
the liability was revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value were recognized currently in the statements of operations under the caption adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
in august  a holder exercised a portion of these warrants and purchased a total of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the remaining warrants for  shares expired unexercised on december  comprehensive loss comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and changes in equity for unrealized holding gains losses on marketable securities during the period 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  we had   and  of comprehensive loss  respectively 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
we have maintained an investment strategy of investing primarily in a premier commercial money market account  which consists primarily of short term debt securities issued by the us government  treasury securities and us government agencies 
the focus on preserving cash and investing in stable securities generated lower returns during the year ended september  we intend to maintain this conservative strategy until the financial markets and interest rates improve 
exercise of warrants in august  holder of warrants that we issued in our august financing exercised a portion of these warrants and purchased a total of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
this exercise resulted in proceeds to us of approximately thousand and reduced the number of outstanding warrants from the august financing to  as of september   we had the following warrants outstanding i warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of which will expire on july   ii warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share which will expire on may   and iii warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants described in clause iii expired unexercised on december  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
share based compensation stock incentive plan in march  our shareholders approved our stock incentive plan  or the plan 
up to  shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the plan  plus shares of common stock underlying already outstanding awards under our prior plans 
the contractual life of options granted under the plan may not exceed seven years 
the plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that are not a full value award will be counted against the share limit as one share for each share of common stock and any award that is a full value award will be counted against the share limit as shares for each one share of common stock 
we have not made any new awards under any prior equity plans after march  the effective date the plan was approved by our stockholders 
we will continue to use the black scholes pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value 
the expected life for these grants was calculated in accordance with the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab topic d in accordance with sab no 
the simplified method was chosen due to our limited history 
until we have adequate history  we will continue to utilize the simplified method 
we recognize compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the share based payments to both employees and non employees 
we selected the black scholes valuation model as the most appropriate valuation method for stock option grants to employees  members of our board of directors and non employees 
the fair value of these stock option grants is estimated as of their date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
because we lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information  we based our estimate of expected volatility on the median historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that we believe are comparable to us based on the criteria set forth in asc topic c and sab topic d  particularly line of business  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
we will continue to consistently apply this process using the same companies or  if those companies become no longer comparable  other appropriately comparable companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available 
however  we will regularly review these comparable companies  and may substitute more appropriate companies if facts and circumstances warrant a change 
we use the simplified method that uses the average of the weighted average vesting period and the contractual life of the option  seven or eight years  to determine the estimated term of the option 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants serving on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes valuation model  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever is longer 
as of september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
because we must revalue these options for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the share based compensation expense related to these non employee options will increase or decrease  based on changes in the price of our common stock 
for the years ended september   and  the share based compensation expense income related to these options was million  million and million  respectively 
restricted stock units we grant restricted stock units  or rsus  to executive officers and employees pursuant to the plan  from time to time 
there is no direct cost to the recipients of rsus  except for any applicable taxes 
each rsu represents one share of common stock 
except as set forth below with regard to rsus awarded to executive officers and employees in december and  additionally  with regard to rsus awarded in connection with a reduction in cash compensation  each award vests annually over three years  with vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder vesting in two equal installments on each anniversary thereafter 
each year following the annual vesting date  between january st and march th  we will issue common stock for each vested rsu 
during the period when the rsu is vested but not distributed  the rsus cannot be transferred and the grantee has no voting rights 
if we declare a dividend  rsu recipients will receive payment based upon the percentage of rsus that have vested prior to the date of declaration 
the costs of the awards  determined as the fair market value of the shares on the grant date  are expensed per the vesting schedule outlined in the award 
for example  rsus awarded to executive officers and employees in december vest over four years and are therefore expensed ratably over the four year vesting period  whereas the rsus awarded in december vest over three years and are expensed in the first year and each year in the next two years 
in connection with a one time reduction in cash compensation expenditures for the fiscal year ended september   our chief executive officer agreed  on october   to reduce his base salary for the fiscal year from  per month to  per month  for total reduction of  we treated the reduced portion of our chief executive officer s base salary as deferred into the  rsus that we granted to him on the same date 
the number of rsus was determined by dividing  by  or the fair market value of our common stock on october   the date of grant 
additionally  effective october   our board of directors modified the compensation it pays to our independent directors for the fiscal year ended september  we typically pay our chairman  in cash annually and each of our other non employee directors  in cash annually 
for the fiscal year ended september   our chairman received  in cash as compensation for serving as a director and the remaining  in the form of rsus 
each other independent director received  in cash as compensation for serving as a director and the remaining  in the form of rsus 
the independent members of our board of directors received a total of  rsus 
the rsus granted in connection with reduced cash compensation were issued under the plan and vested in equal installments on each of december   march   june  and september  the shares of common stock represented by the rsus were distributed on september  for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at september  and  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million and million  respectively  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us federal and million for state tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards expire between and to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available  we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
we updated the section analysis  performed in fiscal year  to incorporate the registered direct offering that we completed in may as of september   we performed a preliminary section analysis in connection with the registered direct offering that we completed in august and believed that an ownership change had occurred 
we updated this analysis to take into account the registered direct offering that we completed in may based on this further review  we determined that an ownership change under section occurred on may  we believe that approximately million of the million federal losses will expire unused as a result of section limitations 
the maximum annual limitation under section is approximately million for years 
the limitation could be further restricted if ownership changes occur in future years 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is limited  future income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in decreased net income 
we also have state research and development credit carryovers of approximately million  which expire commencing in fiscal results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in clinical expenses  million in manufacturing and device development expenses and million in regulatory expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million in expenses related to our discovery activities as we increased our preclinical studies in the year ended september  research and development expenses for the year ended september  were reduced by our receipt in january of million in research grants under the internal revenue service s therapeutic tax credit program and were increased by a million severance charge resulting from the retirement of our former chief scientific officer 
the reductions in clinical expenses reflect reduced expenses of million because we conducted two phase clinical trials during the year ended september   as compared to two month safety extension trials  two tolerability studies and a pump study during the year ended september  in addition  the reductions in clinical expenses reflect reduced professional fees of million and reduced personnel costs of million as a result of our implementation of cost saving initiatives 
the reductions in manufacturing and device development expenses are attributable to savings of million as a result of renegotiating the terms of our recombinant human insulin supply agreement  the completion of our insulin pen development in the year ended september   which resulted in expenses of million that did not recur in the year ended september   and reduced personnel and professional costs of million 
the million reduction in regulatory expenses resulted from lower professional fees in the year ended september  as compared to because year ended september  included the filing our nda and day update with the fda 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
we also recorded a credit of thousand in share based compensation income for the year ended september  for options granted to non employees  which we must revalue for accounting purposes each reporting period 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to a decrease of million in professional fees  million in personnel and employee share based compensation expenses  million in non employee director share based compensation expense and other expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
we also recorded a credit of thousand in share based compensation income for the year ended september  for options granted to non employees  which we must revalue for accounting purposes each reporting period 
interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase resulted primarily from interest on the higher cash balances generated by our may financing and by moving our cash to a premium money market fund which eliminated investment fees and yielded a higher return 
interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability percentage of net loss adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability decreased to million for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the september  decrease of million in warrant liability is comprised of an million and million decrease with the may and august warrants  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the closing price of our common stock on september  of per share being lower than the september  closing price of our common stock of per share  for the august warrants  and the may  closing price of our common stock of for the may warrants 
we use the black scholes valuation method to calculate the fair value for the may warrants and the monte carlo simulation method for the august warrants 
as a result  the fair value for the may and august warrant liability decreased 
the august warrants expired on december  the may warrants will be revalued each reporting period 
net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to reduced expenses and adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability as noted above 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in clinical expenses and million in manufacturing and device development expenses 
the savings in clinical expenses are directly related to conducting fewer studies during the fiscal year ended september  for example  our month safety extension trials for patients who completed the pivotal phase clinical trials of linjeta tm ended in february the savings in manufacturing and device development are the result of purchasing a reduced quantity of recombinant human insulin in the twelve months ended september  of million  as compared to the million of purchases made in the twelve months ended september  the decreases in clinical and manufacturing expenses were offset by increases of million in regulatory expense attributable to professional and consulting fees associated with filing our nda in december and our day safety update in april  million in personnel and share based compensation expenses  million in expenses related to further develop our earlier staged products  and million in professional fees  storage and other expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the share based compensation income for the year ended september  was thousand 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of thousand  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to a decrease in personnel and employee share based compensation expenses of million offset by an increase of million in professional fees  million in non employee director share based compensation expense and other expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in share based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the share based compensation income for the year ended september  was thousand 
interest and other income 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was due to a lower cash balance and shifting our investments primarily into treasury securities

adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability percentage of net loss adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability increased to million for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the september  charge represents an increase in fair value of our warrant liability determined by the monte carlo simulation method 
the monte carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of our and our peer group s future expected stock prices and minimizes standard error 
these warrants will be revalued each reporting period 
net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to reduced clinical and manufacturing expenses and adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability as noted above 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and cash flows as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products or other sources of revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated significant operating losses since we were incorporated in we initially funded our research and development operations through proceeds from our series a convertible preferred stock financing in and our mezzanine and series b convertible preferred stock financings in through december   we had received aggregate gross proceeds of million from these sales 
we received an aggregate of approximately million from our initial public offering in may  our follow on offering in february and our registered direct offerings in august and may at september   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
we plan to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our approved investment policy guidelines

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  primarily reflects the proceeds from the sale of our securities in our registered direct offering in may  our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of  warrants  and the lowering of our restricted cash requirement 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from the sale our securities in our registered direct offering in august and through our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of stock through our employee purchase plan 
in may  we completed a registered direct offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock   shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants will expire on may  we received net proceeds  after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses  of approximately million from this financing 
in august  we completed a registered direct offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
we received net proceeds  after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses  of approximately million from this financing 
in december  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share and in may  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share in connection with our may financing 
in august  warrants for a total of  shares were exercised and we received proceeds of approximately thousand 
the remaining warrants for  shares expired unexercised on december  funding requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the first half of the calendar year 
we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our existing capital resources are not sufficient to complete our clinical development program for an ultra rapid acting formulation of rhi or an insulin analog 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of our product candidates  particularly our proprietary formulations of injectable insulin that are designed to be absorbed more rapidly than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs presently used to treat patients with type and type diabetes  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  the progress  timing or success of our research  development and clinical programs  including any resulting data analyses  our ability to conduct pivotal clinical trials and other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize a proprietary formulation of injectable insulin  our ability to develop and commercialize rhi or insulin analog based formulations that may be associated with less injection site discomfort than the formulation that is the subject of the complete response letter we received from the fda  our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter  or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves  our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates  our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  the degree of clinical utility of our products  the ability of our major suppliers to produce our products in our final dosage form  our commercialization  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategies  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may receive additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants that we issued in connection with our may registered direct offering 
whether the warrants are exercised will depend on decisions made by the warrant holders and on whether the market price of our common stock exceeds the per share warrant exercise price 
the warrants expire on may  we have achieved cost saving initiatives to reduce operating expenses  including the reduction of employees and we continue to seek additional areas for cost reductions 
however  we will also need to raise additional funds and periodically explore sources of equity or debt financing 
we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings  partnerships  joint ventures  debt financings  bank borrowings or other sources 
however  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if we fail to obtain additional capital when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments total fixed contractual obligations adopted accounting pronouncements fair value measurement effective october   we adopted the provisions of asu fair value and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu provides amendments to subtopic  fair value measurements and disclosures overall  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
asu clarifies that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value 
the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
participating securities in june the fasb issued asc earnings per share overall formerly financial statement position emerging issues task force  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities asc 
asc provides that securities and unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
upon adoption  a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform to the provisions of asc warrant liability given that the warrant holders will participate fully on any dividends or dividend equivalents  we determined that the warrants are participating securities and therefore are subject to asc these securities were excluded from the eps calculation since their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
share based compensation given that the holders of restricted stock unit awards rsus will only receive dividends or dividend equivalents on rsus that have vested prior to the company declaring dividends as well as forfeiting their rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents on any unvested portion  we determined that the rsus are non participating securities and therefore are not subject to asc recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  effective for interim periods and years beginning after december  the issuance of asu no 
is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu no 
supersedes the presentation options in asc topic and facilitates convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  as permitted by the terms of our investment policy guidelines 
currently  our excess funds are invested in a premium commercial money market fund with one major financial institution 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates were to increase 
because most of our transactions are denominated in united states dollars  we do not have any material exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
