item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with geoeye s consolidated financial statements and related notes and the discussions under application of critical accounting policies also under item  which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and item a 
risk factors  which describes key risks associated with our operations and industry 

table of contents business and industry factors business strategy we believe we are well positioned as a leading global provider of imagery and imagery information services due to our broad range of imagery collection assets  world class image processing and production facilities  and a strong global distribution network 
key elements of our strategy to take advantage of our competitive position and grow our business include expand our satellite constellation 
with the nga enhancedview award  we will continue to develop and grow our constellation and add capacity to serve our customer base and expand our services 
geoeye is currently under construction and as of december   we have spent million on development 
our recent billion enhancedview award from the nga included up to a million cost share to help fund the development of geoeye it also provided for a ten year enhancedview sla for geoeye and geoeye after it is launched  and value added services 
further expand our value added products and service offerings 
we believe our industry leading image resolution  our proprietary production process and expert personnel establish us as a leader in the field of imagery production and enhancement 
we also expanded the production capacity of our facilities housing our classified and multi source production operations 
our recent acquisition of spadac  inc allows us to provide customers with analytical services that can be used for mission critical and commercial needs 
we believe these and continued investments in our imagery enhancement and production capabilities will enable us to serve the next generation demand for customer specific satellite imagery products and services 
further commercialize our industry leading high resolution imagery 
we plan to develop new platforms and distribution technologies to make our imagery and products more accessible to our current and potential customers 
for example  our eyeq web based services platform sells imagery and other location intelligence based on multi year subscriptions and seat licenses  rather than selling imagery pixels by the square kilometer 
eyeq also offers a web interface with tools that function as our customers data center 
eyeq can serve up imagery and other content for our customers to access via their own data network and for delivery to their customers and partners 
expand our existing  geographically diverse customer base 
we will continue to build on our existing relationships with our customers and our international resellers so that we can offer value added products and services to meet their growing needs 
we remain committed to growing our geographically diverse customer base and driving growth through the continued development of our relationships with international resellers and international ground stations 
continue to deliver quality and timely imagery 
our ability to provide high quality  accurate imagery to our customers in a timely manner is the foundation of our business 
we plan to continue to provide high quality imagery and production services to our customers by means of geoeye and  once it is launched  geoeye we also plan to deploy capital into research and development to augment and enhance our ability to serve our customers 
industry factors the geospatial technologies industry is affected by many different factors 
factors that drive market demand for our products and services include  but are not limited to  increased demand for technologies in response to national defense and environmental observation initiatives  commercial demand for satellite mapping technologies  global infrastructure project initiatives and advances in communication technologies 
factors that could negatively affect market demand for our products and services include  but are not limited to  us and foreign governments developing and launching their own imagery programs  the proliferation of competing surveillance technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles  us export constraints and decreasing federal and international budgets 
as with any industry there are trends  both positive and negative  that can have an impact on the commercial imagery data providers 
positive trends include the following we expect that due to geopolitical uncertainty  global terrorist activity  changing climate trends and large natural disasters  there will be continued demand from both us and international government agencies for up to date and accurate digital imagery and digital mapping databases 
defense personnel may be called upon to deploy to support actions in hostile environments or to respond to natural disasters  and combat mission planners will require the latest geospatial information 
our customers in countries around the world will continue to need to monitor their borders and the other areas of political and economic interest 

table of contents the frequency of natural disasters such as tsunamis  hurricanes and earthquakes has increased awareness of the utility of imagery information products for humanitarian missions and the need for geo information in risk assessment  response and recovery 
satellite data is a valuable tool in assessing disaster response and recovery and planning logistical operations 
geoeye is often the first to deliver commercial satellite imagery to the us government  foreign governments  commercial customers and humanitarian agencies 
commercial satellite imagery was put to immediate use following the january earthquake in haiti 
in late february  geoeye provided imagery from both geoeye and ikonos to the us government after a magnitude earthquake struck chile 
in march  the entire world saw the practical application of commercial satellite imagery for understanding the extent and scope of the volcanic eruption in iceland and the effect of its ash cloud on western europe 
in april  geoeye provided imagery to international customers to better assess the scope and magnitude of the devastation of the earthquake in the central china city of yu shu 
also in april  geoeye began supp lying the us coast guard with millions of kilometers of imagery to understand the scope of the man made oil spill disaster in the gulf of mexico 
geoeye continued to supply the nga and the us coast guard with current imagery throughout the summer so that federal agencies could make better response decisions as the crisis evolved 
geoeye provided imagery for relief workers after the pakistan floods  which began in late july following heavy monsoon rains in the khyber  sindh and punjab regions of pakistan 
over the past few months  geoeye has supplied imagery for humanitarian support and emergency relief support for the wildfires in colorado  the massive floods in queensland  australia  the catastrophic landslides in brazil  and the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
we believe the heightened focus on the global environment could increase use of imagery for global observation to support climate change initiatives or to verify or monitor carbon reduction projects established through legislation or done voluntarily 
commercial demand for geospatial technologies continues to grow 
according to an industry study  the commercial market for imagery better than three meter ground resolution from high resolution imaging satellites is expected to grow over the next few years 
we believe that growth will be fueled in part by the broad awareness created by the online mapping search engines such as google earthtm and microsoft virtual earth tm 
consumers are beginning to utilize location based technologies for everything from navigation to social networking 
the convergence of imagery with gps and personal navigation devices  combined with inexpensive access to broadband communications networks  appears to have generated a development of new commercial applications incorporating imagery and imagery information products 
our technology is well suited for infrastructure project management 
both satellite and aerial imagery  along with other location based technologies  can help the us  other countries and large commercial enterprises achieve their infrastructure goals more efficiently and cost effectively since every infrastructure project has a reference to a physical location on the surface of the globe 
according to an industry trade group  a significant portion of the new stimulus programs proposed by the current us administration will require geospatial data or services  particularly in the areas of design and planning for infrastructure projects  wildfire mapping  environmental infrastructure projects  surveying and charting and airport improvements 
rapid advancements in it infrastructure capabilities such as cloud computing  mobile communications and broadband may have dramatic effects on the industry 
while digital information  including satellite imagery and products  is easily distributed to customers over the internet  there is increasing customer interest in having others host imagery for them while adding value to it in a service oriented environment 
as a result  we anticipate growth in the increasing use of cloud computing where data and applications reside in cyberspace rather than on company servers or hard drives 
the nga s sla is an example of how agencies may utilize geospatial technology rather than just buying imagery pixels by the square kilometer 

table of contents there are also some negative industry trends the us government may build and launch its own classified satellite imaging program and produce imagery similar to or better than that currently provided by commercial data providers 
while the current and the last two government administrations in the us developed commercial remote sensing policies that are favorable for the commercial satellite imagery industry  the intelligence community may make efforts to fund satellite systems that could compete with the commercial imagery data providers 
the current economic demands on the us government resources and the inherent time it takes to design and deploy new imagery satellite systems may mitigate any near term impact should the government decide to develop competing assets 
however  we continue to monitor for any change in the us government s policy toward commercial imagery providers 
more countries are increasingly interested in developing and launching their own imagery satellite systems 
according to a euroconsult study done in january  it is possible that over high resolution satellite systems could be launched and in operation across all regions in the to timeframe 
while none of these imaging systems can currently match the resolution and accuracy of us commercial systems  several countries are planning to launch systems with capabilities similar to our imagery assets 
the development and launch of such systems does involve significant risk and uncertainty  including technological  launch and financing risk 
we are mindful of this trend as we consider how best to grow our business 
the us government is increasingly using other sensors such as unmanned aerial vehicles for more persistent surveillance 
while these systems are mainly used for tactical intelligence collection and tactical and targeted munitions delivery  they can provide commanders with visibility over a smaller area of interest on a more sustained basis 
we believe that our imagery and products will remain an important element in fulfilling the us government s broad imagery needs in both tactical and non mission critical situations 
while not new  the us government continues to place onerous restrictions on the export of space components to all countries 
itar  created a decade ago to ensure us space technology does not fall in the wrong hands  has  in effect  hampered us competitiveness overseas 
such strict government licensing restricts exchange of technical data and export of commercial remote sensing hardware  such as ground stations  thereby encouraging development of foreign manufacturing capability 
we are mindful of overall market trends and the pressure on us federal defense and intelligence budgets 
while our satellite imagery business is somewhat insulated from the general economic downturn because we provide crucial information to defense and intelligence agencies around the world  economic conditions at the state and local level could affect mj harden  our aerial division  and it may be harder to penetrate new markets  particularly the commercial markets

interest expense  net  also includes amortized prepaid financing costs and amortization of debt discount 
interest expense increased during compared to  primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding long term debt 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in our cost of capital from a floating rate of at least percent related to the notes compared to a fixed coupon rate of percent and percent related to the and notes  respectively 
the increase in capitalized interest during as compared to the same period in was due to the increased construction costs of the geoeye satellite during  on which interest is applied 
other non operating expense we recorded other non operating expense of million in related to the fair value measurement of the preferred stock commitment associated with the cerberus stock purchase agreement 
the preferred stock commitment fair value was marked to market and reflected as an adjustment to earnings and added to additional paid in capital when cerberus purchased the preferred stock on september  gain from investments in connection with the acquisition of geoeye analytics  we recognized a gain of million resulting from the increase in the estimated fair value of our non controlling interest in spadac prior to the acquisition 
during the third quarter of  we liquidated our holdings in another cost method investment and recorded a gain of million 

table of contents loss from early extinguishment of debt the loss from early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was million  due to the issuance of the notes with a face value of million in october and repayment of million of our notes 
the early extinguishment of debt represents the expensing of the unamortized prepaid financing costs  unamortized discount and tender premium related to the notes 
write off of prepaid financing costs during the third quarter of  we wrote off unamortized prepaid financing costs of million  including a million non refundable commitment fee  related to costs incurred on the debt financing under the notes purchase agreement with cerberus 
in august  the nga awarded the company the enhancedview contract without a letter of credit requirement  and as a result  the debt facility was cancelled  and these financing costs were expensed 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million and income tax benefit of million for and  respectively 
tax provisions were calculated using our annual effective tax rate of approximately percent and percent for and  respectively 
the increase in our annual effective tax rate is primarily due to the non recurring  non deductible book charges related to the fair value adjustment of the preferred stock commitment partially offset by the tax benefit of the research and development credit 
our income tax benefit is mainly related to restored net operating losses resulting from an irs ruling approved in october the total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are approximately million and million for and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire between tax years and we had tax credit carryforwards of approximately million of which million expire on various dates through the statutes of limitation for income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions for tax years through have not expired  thus  these years remain subject to examination by the irs and state jurisdictions 
significant state jurisdictions that remain subject to examination include colorado and missouri for tax years through and virginia for tax years through for tax years for which we are no longer subject to federal  state and local tax examinations by tax authorities  the tax attribute carryforwards generated from these years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities

table of contents during  we filed an application for change in method of tax accounting for the nextview cost share payments with the internal revenue service 
as a result of the filing  a section a revenue adjustment of million is recognized annually for tax years through during  we submitted an amendment to the original application for a change in method of tax accounting which has not been finalized as of december  non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that represents net income loss before depreciation and amortization expenses  net interest income or expense  income tax expense benefit  non cash stock based compensation expense and other items 
we present adjusted ebitda to enhance understanding of our operating performance 
we use adjusted ebitda as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an operating performance measure  and not a liquidity measure  that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under financial performance under gaap  and our cal culation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures of other companies 
the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool has limitations  and it should not considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for all contractual commitments  it does not reflect our significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness  it does not reflect cash requirements for the payment of income taxes when due  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing adjusted ebitda in isolation  and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as cash flow provided by used in operating activities and capital expenditures  to measure our liquidity 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda is as follows

adjusted cash ebitda is defined as adjusted ebitda less amortization of deferred revenue related to the nextview agreement with the nga in the indenture governing the notes  and as adjusted ebitda less amortization of deferred revenue related to the nextview  enhancedview or any successor agreement with the nga in the indenture governing the notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our borrowings 
equity sources and uses in march  the company entered into a stock purchase agreement and a note purchase agreement with cerberus satellite llc  or cerberus 
the additional debt financing related to the development and launch of geoeye was necessary  because the original request for proposals for enhancedview required that  upon a successful contract award  the company would need to provide a letter of credit for the full amount of any potential cost share award for the development of geoeye that would be received from the nga for a period of up to three years after the nga s certification of the satellite s imagery 
under the stock purchase agreement  cerberus agreed to purchase from the company and the company agreed to sell to cerberus  subject to certain conditions including a successful contract award requiring a letter of credit  u p to  shares of a newly issued series of convertible preferred stock of the company  having an initial liquidation preference of  per share 
if the company received a contract award without the letter of credit requirement  the company would no longer be obligated to issue  shares of preferred stock to cerberus  but cerberus would have the option to purchase  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  or the preferred stock 
under the terms of the note purchase agreement  at the company s option  and assuming a letter of credit requirement  cerberus also agreed to provide the company with debt financing of million  contingent upon the company receiving an award from the nga with a letter of credit requirement 
this letter of credit requirement was subsequently eliminated 
on september   we consummated a preferred stock issuance pursuant to the stock purchase agreement with cerberus 
pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement and as a result of the enhancedview award by the nga being made without the letter of credit requirement  cerberus purchased  shares of preferred stock having a liquidation preference of  per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million  after discounts and before issuance costs 
the issuance of  shares of preferred stock to cerberus represents an ownership interest  assuming conversion of such preferred stock to the company s common stock  of approximately percent as of december the preferred stock will be entitled to receive a dividend at an annual rate of percent  payable in kind  in cash or securities  at the company s option 
the preferred stock will have a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment and customary anti dilution adjustments 
holders of the preferred stock will vote with the company s common stock on an as converted basis 
however  cerberus is not permitted to vote with the preferred stock to the extent it would result in cerberus voting more than an equivalent of percent of the company s outstanding voting securities 
on december   we filed a shelf registration to register the common stock that is issuable upon the conversion of the preferred stock 

table of contents contracted backlog we have historically had and currently have a substantial backlog  which provides some assurance regarding our future revenue expectations 
backlog reduces the volatility of our net cash provided by operating activities more than would be typical for a company outside our industry 
backlog to be recognized in millions beyond total contract backlog enhancedview sla enhancedview cost share amortization nextview cost share amortization international north american commercial us government total backlog total backlog includes all contractual commitments 
these include the remaining portion of our ten year term of the enhancedview sla with the nga  infrastructure design and procurement services under the enhancedview contract with the nga  access fee agreements  regional affiliate ground station operations and maintenance contracts with our international regional affiliate customers  commercial imagery contracts and value added products and services  and remaining unamortized revenue from the nga nextview cost share payments made prior to the geoeye satellite becoming fully operational 
in addition  as part of the enhancedview agreement  the nga has agreed to contribute to the overall construction and launch costs of the geoeye satellite and associated ground station equipment  as well as the design and procurement of additional i nfrastructure to support government operations 
this award component will be initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contractual term of the enhancedview contract 
the enhancedview sla contract is structured as a one year contract  with nine one year renewal options exercisable by the nga 
most of our government contracts  including the enhancedview program  are funded incrementally on a year to year basis  however  certain foreign government and commercial customers have signed multi year contracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in our backlog 
capital expenditures for  our capital expenditures included million for satellites and ground systems and million for property  plant and equipment 
we currently expect that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million  of which million should be related to our continued construction of geoeye under the enhancedview program 
also during  we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
approximately million is associated with building improvements  including the construction of a new satellite operating center  we are making to our new corporate headquarters facility 
our new lease agreement provides for a million tenant improvement reimbursement allowance 
reimbursements under this provision will be recorded as a deferred lease incentive and will reduce rent expense over the remaining lease term 
we expect to utilize the remaining reimbursement allowance during we intend to fund our capit al expenditure requirements through cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 
we do not have any other significant off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year contractual obligations and thereafter total in thousands long term debt obligations interest expense on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents contractual interest payment obligations on the million outstanding principal balance of our notes  which bear interest at a rate per annum of and contractual interest payment obligations on the million outstanding principal balance of our notes  which bear interest at a rate per annum of 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding 
as of december   purchase obligations include enhancedview related commitments  ground systems and communication services 
in addition to the above  the company has entered into commitments subsequent to december   totaling up to approximately million  primarily purchase obligations  all of which expire in and operating leases we have commitments for operating leases primarily relating to equipment and office and operating facilities 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance and minimum lease payments 
these leases contain escalation provisions for increases as a result of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses 
we recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
substantially all of these leases have lease terms ranging from three to twelve years 
some of our leases have options to renew 
total rental expense under operating leases for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in august  we entered into a twelve year lease agreement for a total commitment of million for office space to relocate our corporate headquarters in herndon  virginia 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  revenue recognition  satellites and related ground systems  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from imaging services  the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers and the provision of direct access to our satellites and associated ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services 
we also derive significant revenue from value added production services where we combine our images with data and imagery from our own and other sources to create sophisticated information products 
additionally  effective in  the dissemination  hosting and analysis of imagery became a source of revenue 
we enter into fixed price  unit price and time and materials contracts with our customers 
when recognizing revenue  we consider the following we consider the nature of our contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
we record revenues from the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers based on the delivery of the imagery 
we recognize revenues for the provision of direct access to our satellites on a straight line basis over the delivery term of the contract 
however  certain multi year sales contracts are based on minimum levels of access time with adjustments based on usage 
we recognize revenues for the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and support services based on the delivery of these products and services 
if the satellite access service is combined with the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services and the requirements for separate revenue recognition are not met  we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the combined delivery term of the services 
we record revenues generated from the information services base service offering  including dissemination and hosting of imagery  on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
revenue is recognized on contracts to provide value added production services using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recognized on each production contract based on either the contract price of units of production delivered during a period or upon costs to date plus an estimate of gross profit to date 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known 
under the units of delivery method  revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
contract costs are recognized as incurred  with costs to date of unfinished production for which revenue has not been recognized being capitalized 
under the cost plus gross profit earned method  progress toward completion is measured against all measurable deliverables based on either resources applied or cost incurred compared to total resources or cost projected for the project 
we recognize costs as incurred 
profit is determined based on our estimated profit on the contract multiplied by our progress toward completion 
revenue represents the sum of our costs and profit on the contract for the period 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
these assumptions include future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
we review our contract estimates on a continual basis to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion 
at times  we may receive payments from some customers in advance of providing services 
amounts received from customers pursuant to satellite access prepayment options are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as deferred revenue 
these deferred amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the agreement terms 
in addition  cost share amounts received from the us government are recorded as deferred revenue when received and recognized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the satellite 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether the collection is reasonably assured  which requires us  among other things  to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments in these assumptions and estimates could materially affect the timing and or amount of revenue recognition 

table of contents satellites and related ground systems satellites and related ground systems are recorded at cost 
the cost of our satellite includes capitalized interest cost incurred during the construction and development period 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellite and related ground systems include internal direct labor and project management costs incurred in the construction and development of our satellite and related ground systems 
during the construction phase  the costs of our satellites are capitalized  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the satellite 
the portion of any insurance premiums associated with the insurance coverage of the launch and on orbit commissioning period prior to a satellite reaching start of commercial operations  are capitalized in the original cost of the satellite and are amortized over the estimated life of t he asset 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss was to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
asset impairment assessments goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we calculate the fair market value at the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the company exceeds the fair market value  impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
an impairment test was performed on recorded goodwill and it was determined that no impairment existed as of december  long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of our satellites  fixed assets and other long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be affected by  among other things  changes in estimates of the useful lives of the assets for example  degradatio n in the quality of images downloaded from the satellite  changes in estimates of our ability to operate the assets at expected levels for example  due to intermittent loss of satellite transmissions and the loss of one or several significant customer contracts 
satellites and other property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we estimate the useful lives of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance  including its orbital design life and its estimated service life 
the orbital design life of a satellite is the length of time that the manufacturer has contractually committed that the satellite s hardware will remain operational under normal operating conditions 
in contrast  a satellite s service life is the length of time the satellite is expected to remain operational as determined by remaining fuel levels and consumption rates 
our in orbit satellites generally have operational lives of nine years and service lives as high as thirteen years 
the useful depreciable lives of our satellites are generally the operational lives 
although the service lives of our satellites have historically extended beyond their depreciable lives  this trend may not continue 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our satellites to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary based on the health of the individual satellites 
changes in our estimate of the useful lives of our satellites could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we charge to operations the carrying value of any satellite lost as a result of a launch or in orbit failure upon the occurrence of the loss 
in the event of a partial failure  we record an impairment charge to operations upon the occurrence of the loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the satellite 
we measure the impairment charge as the excess of the carrying value of the satellite over its estimated fair value as determined by the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 

table of contents income taxes income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse 
significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of our deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
as part of our financial process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we evalua te the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based in part on the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed more likely than not that certain tax positions will be sustained 
under asc  a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and  if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we evaluate our tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable  based solely on its technical merits  presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and having access to all relevant facts and information 
when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard  a liability is recorded for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
additionally  for those tax positions that are determined more likely than not to be sustainable  we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit more likely than not determined by cumulative probability to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
investments we record our investments in debt securities at amortized cost or fair value  and we classify these securities as short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet when the original maturities at purchase are greater than ninety days but less than one year 
the company s short term investments consist of debt securities that include commercial paper  corporate bonds  agency notes  variable rate demand notes and certificates of deposit 
investments in debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are recorded at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity 
investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as available for sale 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
other than temporary impairment occurs when the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value  and we determine that difference is not recoverable in the near future 
factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the amortized cost basis 
as of december   we categorized our investments as either available for sale or held to maturity  and all of these outstanding short term investments mature within one year 
although the variable rate demand notes have long term contractual maturity dates of to years  the interest rates reset weekly 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities  they are classified as short term due to our ability to quickly liquidate or put back these securities 
as of december   we had no investments 

table of contents recent and pending accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued revised guidance on revenue from multiple deliverable arrangements including principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the allocation of the consideration 
additionally  this revised guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements using estimated selling prices of deliverables if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
the new guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
an assessment of the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance was performed  and it was deemed t o not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb revised its guidance on accounting for revenue that contains tangible products and software 
the new guidance revised the scope of software revenue guidance  such that software included together with tangible products would not be included within its scope 
the revised guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
an assessment of the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance was performed  and it was deemed to not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new guidance that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  it requires reporting entities to disclose separately the amount of significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers and provide information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level fair value measurements disclosures that are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the updated guidance did not have an effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flow during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are not currently exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates 
all of our debt and held to maturity short term investments as of december   are fixed rate 
at december   the estimated fair value of our long term debt instruments was approximately million  compared with a carrying value of million  excluding the million unamortized discount 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our debt and held to maturity short term investments  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows  because we intend to hold these investments and carry the debt to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
our available for sale investments generally renew every seven days and therefore  are classified as short term investments due to our ab ility to quickly liquidate or put back these securities 
these financial instruments may be subject to interest rate risk through lost income  should interest rates increase during their limited term to maturity or resetting of interest rates and thus may limit our ability to invest in higher income earning investments 
effective july   we had entered into an interest rate cap agreement associated with the notes that was intended to protect us from increases in interest rates by limiting our interest rate exposure to the three month libor with a cap of percent 
the notes were subject to interest rate fluctuation because the interest rate reset semi annually for the term of the notes 
the interest rate cap agreement was outstanding until january  when we paid off the remaining balance of the notes 
we do not currently have any material foreign currency exposure 
our subsidiary in asia commenced operations in january  our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars and the majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars
