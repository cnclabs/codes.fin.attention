net sales net sales for the year were unfavorably impacted by lower prescription volumes due to a lower average number of beds served year over year  along with a shift in mix towards assisted living which generally has lower penetration rates than skilled nursing facilities  reductions in utilization for certain drugs and lower census in client facilities in certain areas  reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues  the increased availability and utilization of generic drugs  as well as lower sales in the company s clinical research organization cro business cro services 
partially offsetting these factors were the favorable impact of drug price inflation  acquisitions and growth in specialty pharmacy services 
see discussion of sales and operating profit results in more detail at the pharmacy services segment and cro services segment captions below 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total net sales was for the year ended december   as compared with in gross profit was unfavorably affected in the period by certain of the aforementioned items that reduced net sales  primarily the reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues  reduced prescription volumes and lower sales at the company s clinical research business 
partially offsetting these factors were the increased availability and utilization of higher margin generic drugs  the favorable effect of drug price inflation and cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts  rebates and other price concessions discounts relating to purchases from the company s suppliers and vendors 
when recognizing the related receivables associated with these discounts  omnicare accounts for these discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold and inventories 
the company records its estimates of discounts earned during the period on the accrual basis of accounting  giving proper consideration to whether those discounts have been earned based on the terms of applicable arrangements  and to the levels of inventories remaining on hand 
receivables related to discounts are regularly adjusted based on the best available information  and to actual amounts as the applicable arrangements are settled and cash is received 
the aggregate amount of these adjustments have not been significant to the company s operations 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses omnicare s consolidated selling  general and administrative operating expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  representing a decrease from the experienced in the prior year period 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were favorably impacted largely by continued progress in the company s non drug purchasing program and productivity improvements 
provision for doubtful accounts during the fourth quarter  omnicare implemented a company wide reorganization program 
among other changes  this program has resulted in numerous senior management and other organizational leadership changes  including a realignment of division presidents for its long term care pharmacy divisions and change in its office of general counsel 
as a result of these activities and the performance of its year end closing process  the company reassessed the allowance for doubtful accounts for facility receivables and concluded that an incremental charge of million was necessary 
the key factors leading to management s change in estimate relate primarily to a decision in the fourth quarter of to implement a different strategic approach for the resolution of past due accounts which are disputed and or currently in litigation 
in particular  this new approach includes a heightened focus on settling outstanding accounts receivable disputes and the avoidance of proacted costly and often disruptive litigation with customers  where possible 
as a result of this change in approach  the company believes it will have reduced opportunities to monetize disputed receivables through litigation  increasing the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 
investment income investment income for the year ended december  was modestly lower than the amount earned in the comparable prior year period 
interest expense interest expense was higher in than the prior year period primarily due to higher interest rates on certain components of the company s overall debt portfolio  a moderately higher overall outstanding debt balance at year end versus year end  and certain debt redemption costs recorded in see additional information at the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective income tax rate the year over year change in the effective tax rate is largely due to certain non deductible expenses  primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in and a larger reduction of income tax expense in the versus periods relating to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions settled through the expiration of statutes of limitations 
see further discussion at the income taxes note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pharmacy services segment for the years ended december  net sales operating income from continuing operations vs 
for the year ended december   omnicare dispensed approximately  prescriptions in comparison to approximately  prescriptions dispensed during the prior year 
pharmacy services sales were favorably impacted by drug price inflation  acquisitions and growth in specialty pharmacy services 
partially offsetting these factors were lower prescription volumes largely due to lower average number of beds served year over year  along with a shift in mix towards assisted living which typically has lower penetration rates than skilled nursing facilities  reduced utilization trends for certain drugs and a reduction in census in certain areas  reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues  and the increased availability and utilization of generic drugs 
while the company is focused on reducing its costs to mitigate the impact of drug pricing and reimbursement issues  there can be no assurance that such issues or other pricing and reimbursement pressures will not adversely impact the pharmacy services segment 
operating income as a percentage of the segment s sales was in  compared with in operating income in was unfavorably affected primarily by the operating income effect of certain of the aforementioned items that reduced net sales  in particular reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues and lower prescription volumes and the previously mentioned incremental charge to provision for doubtful accounts

cro services segment for the years ended december  net sales operating loss income vs 
revenues for were lower than in the prior year period primarily due to lower levels of new business added  as well as early project terminations by clients and client driven delays in the commencement of certain projects 
as a percentage of the segment s revenue  the operating loss was in compared with in the prior year 
the primary reason for the operating loss in relates to a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter  largely as a result of the company s revised outlook on the cro services segment 
see further discussion at the goodwill and other intangible assets note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
see also the additional discussion at the special items caption of this md a 
the operating loss was also attributable to the aforementioned factors that reduced sales as well as restructuring charges of million in incurred to rightsize and reposition the cost structure of the business 
backlog at december  was million  representing a decrease of million from the december  backlog of million 
while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation within our client base  new drug discovery remains an important priority of drug manufacturers 
the company believes that drug manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in drug research development and commercialization 
vs 
net sales net sales for the year were favorably impacted by drug price inflation  the increased use of certain higher acuity drugs  biologic agents and existing drugs with new therapeutic indications  and acquisitions  as well as growth in specialty pharmacy services 
more than offsetting these factors were the unfavorable sales impact of the increased availability and utilization of generic drugs  reductions in reimbursement and or utilization for certain drugs as well as competitive pricing issues  a lower average number of beds served year over year  a shift in mix towards assisted living and lower revenues in the company s cro business 
see discussion of sales and operating profit results in more detail at the pharmacy services segment and cro services segment captions below

selling  general and administrative expenses omnicare s operating expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  representing a decrease from the experienced in the prior year 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were favorably impacted largely by continued progress in the company s productivity improvement initiatives  non drug purchasing initiatives  reductions in employee benefit costs and the continued integration of prior year acquisitions 
these favorable items were partially offset by increased operating costs associated with recent acquisitions 
provision for doubtful accounts the reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts during the period relates largely to the improved overall accounts receivable position of the company 
specifically  net accounts receivable of approximately  million at december  was million lower than the december  balance of approximately  million 
further  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively  representing a year over year reduction of days 
investment income investment income for the year ended december  was modestly lower than amount earned in the prior year  primarily due to lower interest rates versus the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was lower than the prior year  primarily due to lower debt outstanding resulting from payments aggregating million on the company s senior term a loan facility  maturing on july  the term loans  throughout and  payments of million to pay off a term note payable in the fourth quarter of and lower interest rates on variable rate loans 
effective income tax rate the year over year decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to the reduction of income tax expense in the period totaling approximately million  primarily attributable to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions settled through the expiration of statutes of limitations  partially offset by certain nondeductible litigation costs recognized in the period

the program is anticipated to be completed in and is currently estimated to result in restructuring and other related charges of approximately million  the majority of which is anticipated to be incurred in the pharmacy and corporate segments  and is largely related to severance and employee buyout costs  which will primarily be operating expense related 
in implementing these initiatives  the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately million in the year ended december  the company anticipates that net positions eliminated and total savings as a result of the cwr program will not significantly impact the company s overall employee base or overall operating results  respectively

see further discussion at the discontinued operations note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at part ii  item  of this filing 
impact of inflation the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar products during the three years ended december  has ranged between approximately to  which tends to impact sales and costs of sales at approximately the same level 
therefore  inflation has not materially affected omnicare s net income  inasmuch as government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  were million compared with million at december  including restricted cash amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company generated net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations of million during the year ended december   compared with net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating cash flows in were used primarily for debt payments  acquisition related payments  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and dividend payments 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in net income as well as the year over year change in inventories due to large inventory reductions in as a result of full potential hub and spoke integration activities in these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a year over year reduction in accounts receivable as well as in the cash requirements relating to accounts payable activity 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a fourth quarter payment of approximately million due to the settlement with the united states attorney s office  district of massachusetts  which was more than offset by the favorable impacts of a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable during the period 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by the extra payment to the company s drug wholesaler of approximately million these payments are due weekly  and the year ended december  included one extra weekly payment  and the related impact on the year over year movement in accounts payable on operating cash flows 
favorably impacting operating cash flow was the excess of tax deductible interest expense over book interest expense related to the company s junior subordinated convertible debentures  convertible debentures and convertible notes 
this resulted in an increase in the company s deferred tax liabilities during the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively million cumulative as of december  
the recorded deferred tax liability could  under certain circumstances  be realized in the future upon conversion or redemption of the debt  which would serve to reduce operating cash flows

the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for at least the next year  although no such assurances can be given in that regard 
additionally  the company believes that external sources of financing  including short and long term debt financings  are available

omnicare records interest payable to the old trust and new trust as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the company had no other unconsolidated entities  or any financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its swap agreements related to certain of the company s borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates on fixed to floating rate swap agreements for certain debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis points 
in connection with its offering of million of notes during  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the notes the swap agreement 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months  plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
also  in december  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the notes the swap agreement 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with an interest period of six months  plus a spread of a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pre tax interest expense by approximately million per year

the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its critical estimates giving consideration to a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at part ii  item  of this filing 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  omnicare recognizes revenue when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to the customer  prices are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy services segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products have been reimbursed by the federal medicare part d plan and  to a lesser extent  state medicaid programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a portion of the company s revenue systems are largely computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of the company s revenue systems  the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed  unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for billed  unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicare  medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
patient co payments are associated with medicare part d  certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
cro services segment a portion of the company overall revenues relates to the cro services segment  and is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  nutraceutical  medical devices and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue  on the respective lines of the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance  cash flows and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility and private pay customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts represented and of gross receivables net of contractual allowance adjustments as of december  and december   respectively 
unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in the company s provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages  which could materially impact the overall financial results  financial position or cash flows of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of december  would result in an increase to the provision for doubtful accounts and related allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
patient charges pending approval from medicare  medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicare  medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicare  medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
in the fourth quarter  omnicare management decided to implement a different strategic approach for the resolution of past due accounts which are disputed and or currently in litigation 
in particular  this new approach includes a heightened focus on maintaining positive relationships with current and former customers  with a greater priority on settling outstanding accounts receivable disputes and the avoidance of litigation where possible 
as a result of this change in approach  the company believes there is an increased risk of uncollectible accounts receivable  and adjusted its provision for doubtful accounts accordingly 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers  as well as efforts to collect rework medicare part d copays and rejected claims 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible by omnicare management including the national credit and collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company does not have a significant portion of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company experience  management believes that the aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly or the company customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected

goodwill goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment is largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the book carrying value of the assets would exceed their fair value  an impairment loss may be necessary 
changes in the estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
adverse conditions in the cro market have led to lower than anticipated levels of new business being added as well as early project terminations by clients and client driven delays in the commencement of certain projects resulting in lower than expected operating profits and cash flows for this business 
management anticipated a turnaround in its cro services business in the third quarter of based on various restructuring activities enacted in late and during the first half of eg  reductions in force  location consolidation  etc based on the unanticipated continuation of the decline in operating performance during the third quarter of  coupled with the revised outlook  the company s earnings outlook for the cro business has been reduced 
as a result  the company determined it was required to perform an interim impairment test with respect to goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to its cro services reporting unit outside of its normal fourth quarter test period 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  is a comparison of the reporting unit estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment 
the second step requires the company to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
the company estimated the fair value of the cro reporting unit in step one based on discounted cash flows which required significant management judgement  as well as a market approach that compared the reporting unit earnings and revenue multiples to those of comparable public companies 
the outcome of step one  requiring that the company perform the second step resulted in a fair value less than the company carrying value 
next  the second step required the company to allocate the fair value of the cro reporting unit that failed the first step test to the fair value of the reporting unit net assets 
the company calculated the fair values of the reporting unit net assets  with assistance from a third party valuation firm in the determination of fair values for significant tangible and intangible assets 
based on the results of the step two process  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the third quarter the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended december  and and  except for the aforementioned cro goodwill impairment charge in  concluded that goodwill had not been impaired 
given the substantial amount of the excess of fair value over carrying value  none of the company s reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing step one of omnicare s most recent annual goodwill impairment test 
taxes the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under this authoritative guidance  recognition and measurement are considered discrete events 
the recognition threshold is met when it is determined a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries  investigations and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits  investigations and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of inspections  audits  inquiries  investigations  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  investigations  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company believes that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it cannot at this time predict the ultimate effect of any of these initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
the company s outlook for future operating results are favorably impacted by the anticipated effects of certain pharmaceutical marketplace dynamics  such as branded drug price inflation and new generics  as well as productivity improvements in the company s operations 
further  in addition to any potential impacts associated with the regulatory and other matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs  factors that could negatively impact the company s future operating results include the impact of pricing adjustments and bed losses  as well as an increase in its payroll costs
