dodd frank  the eesa  the arra  and the related governmental programs include a variety of initiatives that could have a significant impact on the banking industry and on arrow  however  the actual impact that these new laws and programs will have on the financial markets  the financial services industry and arrow cannot be determined at this time 
in addition  various other federal bills that would significantly affect banks have been introduced in congress 
we cannot estimate the likelihood of any currently proposed banking bills being enacted into law  or the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon our financial condition or operations 
new federal banking laws the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of became effective october  the act addressed many areas of bankruptcy practice  including consumer bankruptcy  general and small business bankruptcy  treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy  ancillary and cross border cases  financial contract protection amendments to chapter governing family farmer reorganization  and special protection for patients of a health care business filing for bankruptcy 
this act did not have a significant impact on our earnings or on our efforts to recover collateral on secured loans 
in january of  congress began to consider a bill that would give bankruptcy judges the power to alter rates  terms  balances and maturities of home mortgage loans 
the sarbanes oxley act  signed into law on july   adopted a number of measures having a significant impact on all publicly traded companies  including arrow 
generally  the act sought to improve the quality of financial reporting of these companies by compelling them to adopt good corporate governance practices and by strengthening the independence of their auditors 
the act placed substantial additional duties on directors  officers  auditors and attorneys of public companies 
among other specific measures  the act required that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify to the sec in the holding company s annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec regarding the accuracy of its financial statements contained therein and the integrity of its internal controls 
the act also accelerated insiders reporti ng requirements for transactions in company securities  restricts certain executive officer and director transactions  imposed obligations on corporate audit committees  and provided for enhanced review of company filings by the sec 
as part of the general effort to improve public company auditing  the act places limits on consulting services that may be performed by a company independent auditors by requiring that the company s audit committee of the board of directors evaluate amounts to determine independence 
the act created a federal public company accounting oversight board the pcaob to set auditing standards  inspect registered public accounting firms  and exercise enforcement powers  subject to oversight by the sec 
in the wake of the sarbanes oxley act  the nation s stock exchanges  including the exchange on which arrow s stock is listed  the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd promulgated a wide array of governance standards that must be followed by listed companies 
the nasd standards include having a board of directors the majority of whose members are independent of management  and having audit  compensation and nomination committees of the board consisting exclusively of independent directors 
we have implemented a variety of corporate governance measures and procedures to comply with sarbanes oxley and the amended nasd listing requirements  although we have always relied on a board of directors a majority of whose members are independent and independent board committees to make important decisions regarding the company 
the usa patriot act initially adopted in and re adopted by the us congress in with certain changes the patriot act  imposes substantial new record keeping and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions  with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers 
the us treasury department has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the patriot act requirements 
the patriot act requires all financial institutions  including banks  to establish certain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
the provisions of the act impose substantial additional costs on all financial institutions  including ours 
in november  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act glba  which permitted bank holding companies to engage in a wider range of financial activities 
for example  under glba bank holding companies may underwrite all types of insurance and annuity products and all types of securities products and mutual funds  and may engage in merchant banking activities 
bank holding companies that wish to engage in these or other financial activities generally must do so through separate financial subsidiaries and may themselves be required to register and qualify to register as so called financial holding companies 
a bank holding company that does not register as a financial holding company remains a bank holding company subject to substantially the same regulatory restrictions and permitted activities as applied to bank holding companies prior to glba see item ic  supervision and regulation  above 
we have not elected to become a financial holding company 
also under glba  financial institutions have become subject to stringent customer privacy regulations  in addition to the privacy provisions under the fair credit reporting act amendment of recent changes in deposit insurance laws and regulations 
the fdic collects both insurance premiums on insured deposits and an assessment for the financing corporation fico bonds 
the fico was established by the competitive equality banking act of  and is a mixed ownership government corporation whose sole purpose was to issue bonds to insure thrift institutions 
outstanding fico bonds  which are year noncallable bonds with a principal amount of approximately billion  mature in through fico has assessment authority  separate from the fdic authority to assess risk based premiums for deposit insurance  to collect funds from all fdic insured institutions sufficient to pay interest on fico bonds 
the fdic acts as collection agent for the fico 
since the first quarter of  all fdic insured deposits have been assessed at the same rate by fico 
for  our fico assessment was thousand 
in the fdic resumed charging financial institutions a premium under the new risk based assessment system 
under this system  institutions in risk category i the lowest of four risk categories will pay a rate based on a formula of to cents per of assessable deposits 
both of our banks qualified for the cent per assessment rate during the federal deposit insurance reform act of allowed eligible insured depository institutions to share a one time assessment credit pool of approximately billion 
our credit amounted to thousand 
the credit was available to offset fdic insurance premiums beginning in  but not to offset the fico bond assessment  which will continue through the one time credit fully offset our fdic insurance premiums for and offset approximately thousand of our thousand fdic premiums 
in  in response to the level of claims against the bank insurance fund  the fdic announced that it would raise the lowest rate from cents to cents per of assessable deposits beginning with the first quarter of  which remained in effect throughout and in addition  beginning with the second quarter of  the fdic added four new factors to the assessment rate calculation  including factors for brokered deposits  secured liabilities and unsecured liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions  including our banks  at 
of total assets as adjusted for tier capital 
we charged thousand to earnings in the second quarter of for this assessment  which was paid on september  in the fourth quarter of  the fdic collected prepaid assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and based on the current rate of cents per in and and cents per for and  our prepaid assessment amounted to million 
the expense will be ratably recorded over the respective periods as directed by the fdic 
amounts expenses for fdic insurance and the fico assessment are included in the table of other expenses in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february of  the fdic finalized the new assessment system to take effect in the second quarter of the final rule changes the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity  adopts a new large bank pricing assessment scheme  and sets a target size for the deposit insurance fund 
the changes will go into effect beginning with the second quarter and will be payable at the end of september 
the rule as mandated by dodd frank finalizes a target size for the deposit insurance fund at percent of insured deposits 
it also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches percent so that the average rate over time should be about basis points and  in lieu of dividends  provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches percent and percent 
also as mandated by dodd frank  the rule changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
we expect that the new assessment system will result in lowering our fdic insurance assessments in we are unable to predict whether or to what extent the fdic may elect to impose additional special assessments on insured institutions in upcoming years  although it is commonly understood that the fdic insurance fund may not be adequate if bank failures continue at their present rate for any significant period of time and or the cost to the fdic of the bank failures recently resolved by it should prove even greater than was initially anticipated

competition we face intense competition in all markets we serve 
traditional competitors are other local commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan institutions and credit unions  as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks 
like all banks  we encounter strong competition in mortgage lending from a wide variety of other mortgage originators  all of whom are principally affected in this business by the rate and terms set  and the lending practices established by the very large and growing government supported entities fannie mae and freddie mac  who purchase and or guarantee a very substantial dollar amount and number of mortgage loans  which in accounted for a large majority of the total amount of mortgage loans extended in the us additionally  non banking financial organizations  such as consumer finance companies  insurance companies  securities firms  money market and mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of the various other types of loan and financial products and transactional accounts that we offer  even though these non banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us 
under federal banking laws  such non banking financial organizations not only may offer products comparable to those offered by commercial banks  but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks

risk factors our financial results and the market price of our stock in future periods are subject to risks arising from many factors  including the following please note that the discussions below regarding potential impact on arrow of certain of these factors that may develop in the future are not meant to provide predictions by arrow management that such factors will develop  but to acknowledge the possible impact that could occur if the factors do develop 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry 
for many financial institutions  dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past three years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values 
to date  the impact of these adverse market conditions has been less significant on arrow than it has been on many other us financial institutions 
write downs at many of these other institutions  initially of asset backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans  have caused a number of those institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stabi lity of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
generally  in the financial services sector  this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies at many institutions  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity 
although this turmoil has affected arrow and our local markets less than certain other institutions and markets so far  the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already  to some extent  adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market developments may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may i mpact our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on arrow and others in the financial institutions industry 
if economic conditions  already weak  should worsen and the us experiences a prolonged economic slump  the company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses at the balance sheet date 
our allowance for loan losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio  including the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio and other factors 
if the economy in our geographic market area  northeastern region of new york state  should deteriorate or enter into a prolonged state of recession  this may have an additional adverse impact on our loan portfolio 
if the quality of our portfolio should weaken due to this impact  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses  and future enhanced provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect financial results 
moreover  loan portfolio difficulties often accompany difficulties in other areas of our business  including growth of our business generally  thereby compounding the negative effects on earnings 
a sustained and or significant increase in domestic interest rates could negatively affect the company s net interest income 
an institution s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest  including short term and long term rates and the relationship between the two 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies such as the federal reserve board  and actions taken by foreign central banks 
like all financial institutions  the company s balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
recently  long term interest rates have begun to rise  and many commentators believe that the federal reserve and other central banks will begin to increase short term rates within the next months or soon thereafter 
together  these developments ie  a rising rate environment may negatively affect banks profitability 
see the discussion under changes in net interest income due to rate  on page of this report 
if economic conditions worsen significantly and the us financial markets should suffer another downturn  the company may experience limited access to credit markets 
as discussed under part i  item d liquidity  the company has relationships with various third parties to provide overnight and longer term credit arrangements 
as these third parties themselves have difficulty in accessing their own credit markets then we may  in turn  experience a decrease in our capacity to borrow funds from them or other third parties traditionally relied upon by banks for liquidity 
if the value of real estate in our market area were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which might have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to considering the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of borrowers  we often secure loans with real estate collateral  which in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower 
this real property may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is outstanding 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
furthermore  the possibility of legislative changes at the federal or state level  related to foreclosure proceedings  may result in negative impacts to financial institutions 
if securities prices should significantly decline in upcoming periods a double dip recession  we likely will experience a reduction in income from fiduciary activities 
the most significant portion of the income we earn from managing assets in our fiduciary capacity is tied to the market value of those assets  ie  investment securities 
we are subject to the local economies where we operate  and unfavorable economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon the growth in business activity  income levels and deposits in our geographic market area 
unpredictable and unfavorable economic conditions unique to our market area may have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and financial performance 
as a community bank  we are less able than our larger regional competitors to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions over a larger market area 
moreover  we cannot give any assurances that we will benefit from any unique and favorable economic conditions in our market area  even if they do occur 
current levels of market volatility 
the market for certain investment securities  including mortgage backed securities  has been highly volatile or inactive  and may not stabilize or resume in the near future 
this volatility can result in significant fluctuation in the prices of those securities  some of which we hold in our investment portfolio  which could affect the results of our operations 
changes in accounting standards may materially impact the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board fasb changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in changes to previously reported financial statements 
specifically  changes in the fair value of our financial assets could have a significant negative impact on our asset portfolios and indirectly o n our capital levels 
the company s business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly or fails to provide for an orderly management succession 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain our key personnel for the duration of their expected terms of service  and to arrange for an orderly succession of other  equally skilled personnel 
competition for the best people in our business can be intense 
while our board of directors actively reviews succession plans  any sudden unexpected change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business 
the company relies on other companies to provide key components of the company s business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and mutual fund distribution 
these parties are beyond our control  and any problems caused or experienced by these third parties  including their not providing us their services or performing such services poorly  or not being able to continue to perform such services  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect arrow 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
arrow has exposure to many different counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other financial institutions 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could lead to market wide liquidity problems and to losses or defaults by arrow or by other institutions and organizations 
n bsp  many of these transactions expose arrow to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  arrow s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by arrow cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due arrow 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the company faces continuing and growing security risks to its own information base and to information on its customers 
the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use are always vulnerable to unforeseen problems  including theft of confidential customer information identity theft and interruption of service as a result of fire  natural disasters  explosion or general infrastructure failure 
these problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third party service providers 
we constantly assess and attempt to improve our security systems and disaster preparedness  including back up systems  but the risks in these areas are substantially escalatin g 
the company s stock price may begin to reflect market volatility more closely than it has in the past 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  significant acquisitions or business combinations  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  new technology used or services offered by our competitors  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and changes in government regulations 
many of these factors that may adversely affect our stock price are less reflective of our particular condition or operating results than general market fluctuations  industry wide factors or general economic or political condit ions and events  including terrorist attacks  economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes  credit loss trends or currency fluctuations 
we may be adversely affected by new and enhanced government regulation 
even before the recent financial crisis and regulatory changes to law and regulation  we were subject to extensive federal and state banking regulations and supervision 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect our depositors funds and the federal deposit insurance funds  not the company s stockholders 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in the imposition of limitations on our operations that would adversely impact our operations and could  if capital levels dropped significantly  result in our being required to cease or scale back our operations 
on top of the preexisting regulatory structure  the recent changes in governing law  regulations and regulatory practices could impose additional costs on us or adversely affect our ability to obtain deposits or make loans and thereby hurt our revenues and profitability 
many provisions of the dodd frank are subject to additional regulation and rulemaking before implementation 
in addition  dodd frank requires multiple studies which could result in additional legislative action 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the dodd frank or the resulting regulations and rules may adversely impact the company 
however  compliance with the dodd frank may increase our costs  cause us to modify our strategies and business operations  and increase our capital requirements  any of which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition

there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
any downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition at the same time that other areas of our operations  including new loan originations and assets under administration in our trust department may also be experiencing negative pressures from the same underlying negative economic conditions 
liabilities for retirement plans we have a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of return on plan investments 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy  our own operations or applicable law and regulation may result in material changes to our liability for postretirement expense  with consequent impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets accounting standards require a reduction in the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is  in part  based on an estimate of future taxable income 
goodwill accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
other than temporary decline in the value of debt and equity securities accounting standards require that  for individual securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  an enterprise shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss 
if we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
any significant economic downturn might result  and historically have on occasion resulted  in an other than temporary impairment in securities held in our portfolio 
valuation methods for securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis most of the available for sale portfolio  which includes us treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal securities  corporate debt and equity securities are priced using industry standard models that consider various assumptions that include time value  yield curves  volatility factors  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are either observable in the marketplace  derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
municipal and corporate securities are valued using a type of matrix  or grid  pricing in which securities are benchmarked against the treasury rate based on credit rating 
these model and matrix measurements are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and our financial condition as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
when necessary  prior year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income of million for  an increase of thousand  or  compared to diluted earnings per share of represented an increase of  or  from our net income for  determined in accordance with gaap  included a million gain  net of tax  that we recognized on the sale of our merchant bank card processing to transfirst  a one time transaction which closed in that period the transaction 
we have adjusted net income for the period to exclude income from this transaction 
doing so produces a non gaap measure  adjusted net income  as well as additional non gaap measures derived therefrom  ie  adjusted diluted earnings per share  adjusted return on equity and adjusted return on assets for the period 
under sec rules  these non gaap measures  if provided in a filed report such as this report  must be accompanied by a reconciliation to the nearest comparable gaap measure 
the table below presents thes e non gaap measures for the period  as well as a reconciliation of these measures to the comparable gaap measures for the period  and a comparison between these non gaap adjusted measures for the period and our comparable gaap measures for the period  that is  our net income  diluted earnings per share  return on average assets and return on average equity for  prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe the inclusion of the non gaap measure for the period and the comparison between the period gaap measures and the period non gaap measures is meaningful and helpful  because it better reveals the earnings from our fundamental line of business  the commercial banking business  and the trend from period to period in that business

during  our net interest margin increased primarily due to falling short term interest rates which has a proportionately larger impact on the cost of our deposits than on our earnings from our assets 
this combined with a market wide return of a positively sloped yield curve which has a proportionately larger impact on our earning assets than on our liabilities and a increase in average earning assets resulted in increased net income in however  during both and  we experienced a decrease in our net interest margin as rates remained very low  and the increase in net interest income that we experienced was due to the growth in earning assets 
our margin compression in and resulted from the fact that our deposits were already at such low rates going into that it was not possible to effect significant additional downward repricing during this period  while our loa n cash flows continued to reprice downward 
importantly  we did not experience significant deterioration in our loan and asset quality during despite the continuing worldwide economic recession and severe disruption in the financial markets generally  which began in although our earnings in was positively impacted by one significant transaction  discussed below and later in this report  net income for was a record high for us 
financial market turmoil continues from the third quarter of through year end  the dow jones industrial average dow jones lurched from a high of over  to a low of under  and then rebounded to as high as  demonstrating a degree of volatility not seen in many decades  with the most dramatic change occurring during the fourth quarter of the us economy itself experienced a similarly severe downturn in and  but a less dramatic recovery in the financial sector and particularly banks have been severely affected  suffering major losses on mortgages and other credit portfolios and an industry wide loss of short term liquidity 
in addition  bank failures have continued to occur with regularity  throughout and  and are expected to persist for the foreseeable future 
many community banks  like our company  have not experience d significant losses in their loan or investment portfolios or the liquidity concerns that many of our larger contemporaries have experienced  but expanding problems in commercial real estate portfolios throughout the us now threaten many of these community banks 
however  the magnitude of turmoil in the markets did have an impact on our operations during and and may continue to influence our financial condition and results of operations in forthcoming periods 
decision not to participate in us treasury tarp cpp in as previously disclosed in our current report in form k filed with the sec on january   our board of directors determined in late january  after we had applied for participation by the company in the us government s capital purchase plan an element of the larger troubled assets relief program  and after we had been preliminarily approved by the department of treasury for participation  that we would not proceed ahead and sell shares of our preferred stock to the treasury department but would decline to participate 
the basic reason for the board s decision  as discussed in the form k  was that the company s financial and liquidity positions remained sufficiently strong through the downturn such that the potential loss of board and management flexibility entailed in participation in the program was deemed too high a cost to warrant participation 
sale of merchant bank card processing to transfirst in as we previously reported on march   our bank subsidiaries  glens falls national and saratoga national  sold their merchant bank card processing business for an initial cash payment at closing of million to transfirst llc transfirst and a bank designated by transfirst 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a relationship with transfirst under which transfirst will provide merchant bank card processing to merchant customers of our subsidiary banks 
the gain was offset  in part  by an estimated thousand cost to terminate certain pre existing agreements for a net gain of million  which we recognized in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  a post closing adjustment to the purchase price substantially eliminated the termination fees related to the pre existing agreements such that our net gain on the sale of the business as adjusted increased thousand to approximately million 
fdic special assessment prepayment in the fdic announced during the second quarter of that they would levy a special assessment on all fdic insured financial institutions to rebuild the fdic s insurance fund which has recently been depleted by bank failures 
the special assessment was set at of an institution s total assets less tier capital 
institutions were instructed to estimate and accrue the expense in the second quarter of we determined that our expense was thousand  which we accrued on june  during the third quarter of the fdic announced that it would not impose any additional special assessments in the remainder of  but would generate additional much needed cash for the insurance fund by requiring insured institutions to prepay in the fourth quarter of their projected assessments for the fourth quarter of and all of  and our prepayment amount of million  will be amortized  as required by bank regulatory guidance  into expense during the relevant periods to which such assessment relates 
economic recession and loan quality as the economic recession got underway in late  our market area of northeastern new york was relatively sheltered from falling real estate values and increasing unemployment 
as the recession became stronger and deeper in late  even northeastern new york began to feel the impact of the worsening national economy reflected in a slow down in real estate sales and increasing unemployment rates 
by year end  we had experienced a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  although by standard measures our portfolio continued to appear stronger than the average for our peer group throughout and nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   an increase of thousand from the prior year end 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans was 
at december   an increase of only one basis point from one year earlier 
by way of comparison  this ratio for our peer group increased during the same period by basis points  from at december  to at september  our loans charged off net of recoveries against our allowance for loan losses were thousand for  as compared to million for the prior year 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans  an increase of basis points from the prior year end 
to date  we have not experienced significant deterioration in any of our three major loan portfolio segments o commercial loans we lend to small and medium size businesses  which typically do not encounter liquidity problems  since we often also provide support for their supplementary liquidity needs 
current unemployment rates in our region are higher than in the past few years and the number of total jobs has decreased  but these trends are largely attributable to a few changes in the local operations of a small number of larger corporations 
commercial property values have not shown significant deterioration and we update the appraisals on our nonperforming and watched commercial properties as deemed necessary  usually when the loan is downgraded or when we perceive significant market deterioration since our last appraisal 
o residential real estate loans we have not experienced a notable increase in our foreclosure rates  primarily due to the fact that we did not originate or participate in underwriting subprime or other high risk mortgage loans  such as so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm s or negati ve equity loans 
o indirect automobile loans these loans comprise over of our loan portfolio 
we have not experienced any significant increases in our delinquency rate or level of charge offs 
both delinquencies and charge offs did increase modestly during  but delinquencies actually decreased in investment securities and other than temporary impairment prior to lehman s bankruptcy in september  we held a million par value senior unsecured bond issued by lehman 
immediately after the bankruptcy  the fair value of the bond decreased significantly 
we deemed the decline to be other than temporary in the third quarter  and  accordingly  recognized a non cash other than temporary impairment charge to earnings of thousand net of tax a 
reduction in diluted earnings per share 
after further deterioration in the bond  we recognized an additional charge to earnings of thousand net of tax a 
reduction in diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of the remaining estimated value of our lehman bond of thousand was included in non performing assets as of december  during  we sold the bond at an additional loss of thousand 
also during  we recognized a thousand impairment charge on one inactively traded common stock which we continue to hold in our available for sale portfolio 
we did not hold any preferred or common stock of fannie mae or freddie mac 
as of year end  we had not experienced any impairment issues with our holdings of mortgage backed securities or cmo s 
mortgage backed securities held by the company are comprised of pass through securities backed by conventional residential mortgages and guaranteed by government agencies or government sponsored entities 
we do not hold any private label mortgage backed securities or securities backed by subprime or other high risk non traditional mortgage loans 
liquidity and access to credit markets we have not experienced any liquidity issues during and through the date of this report 
the terms of our lines of credit with our correspondent banks  the fhlbny and the federal reserve bank have not changed  except for some increases in the maximum borrowing capacity see our general liquidity discussion on page 
in general  we rely on asset based liquidity ie funds in overnight investments and cash flow from maturing investments and loans with liability based liquidity as a secondary source overnight lending arrangements with our correspondent banks  fhlbny overnight and term advances and the federal reserve bank discount window  as our main sources 
during the recent period of bank failures  a few institutions experienced a run on deposits  even though there was no reasonable expectation that depositors would lose any of their insured deposits 
we maintain  and periodically test  a contingent liquidity plan whose purpose is to ensure that we can generate an adequate amount of cash to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises 
visa transactions in  and on march   visa inc distributed to its member banks  including glens falls national  by way of a mandatory redemption of of the visa class b shares held by the member banks  some of the proceeds realized by visa from the initial public offering and sale of its class a shares just then completed 
with another portion of the ipo proceeds  visa established a billion escrow fund to cover certain  but not all  of its continuing litigation liabilities under various antitrust claims  which its member banks are otherwise required to bear 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  we recorded the following transactions a pre tax gain of thousand from the mandatory redemption by visa from us of of our class b visa inc shares  reflected as an increase in noninterest income  and a reversal of thousand of the thousand accrual previously recorded by us at december   representing our then estimated proportional share of visa litigation costs  which reversal was reflected as a reduction in other operating expense 
in october  visa announced that it had settled a lawsuit with discover financial services  which was part of the covered litigation for which the visa member banks remained contingently liable and for which visa had established its escrow fund 
since that time  visa has deposited additional amounts into the escrow fund for covered litigation billion in december  million in july  million in may and million in october these developments reduced the company s proportionate exposure for covered litigation but also reduced the ultimate value of its remaining class b visa shares  as visa s settlement of covered litigation claims directly reduced the value of member banks class b stock 
however  the compa ny had not previously recognized the value of its remaining class b shares in accordance with sec guidance  thus the company did not recognize any income or expense in any of the periods presented as a result of the reduced value of its class b shares upon visa s settlement of the litigation 
the estimation of the company s proportionate share of any potential losses related to the remaining covered litigation is extremely difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty 
management has determined that the remaining thousand liability included in other liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet represents the fair value of our proportionate share of the remaining covered visa litigation obligations at that date  but this value is subj ect to change depending upon future developments in the covered litigation 
change in stockholders equity at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on stockholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from year end our total stockholders equity at year end increased over the year end level 
major changes to stockholders equity included i million of net income for the year  ii net unrealized gain of thousand in securities available for sale  net of taxes  and iii equity received from our various stock plans of million  net of taxes  offset by iv cash dividends of million  v net changes in our pension plans reflected as other comprehensive income of thousand  and vi repurchases of our own common stock of million 
as of the last trading day of  our closing stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to our tangible book value 
the company and each of its subsidiary banks also continue to remain classified as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
as mentioned above  due to our strong capital  financial and liquidity positions  we did not participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program a component of tarp 
the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin

the increase in net interest income was million  or  from to net interest income increased million  or  from to in  an increase in average earning assets  net of a smaller increase in average paying liabilities ie  changes in volume had a million positive impact on net interest income  while changes in rates provided a million negative impact on our net interest income for the year  reflecting the fact that the prevailing federal funds rates stayed in the range of to 
for all the year 
generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes  and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
impact of interest rate changes our profitability is affected by the prevailing interest rate environment  both short term rates and long term rates  by changes in those rates  and by the relationship between short and long term rates ie  the yield curve 
changes in interest rates 
from mid to fall  the fed maintained elevated short term rates  with a federal funds target rate of 
in september  however  in response to a weakening economy and a loss of liquidity in the short term credit market  precipitated in large part by the collapse in the housing market and resulting problems in subprime residential real estate lending  the fed began lowering the federal funds target rate  rapidly and by significant amounts 
by the december meeting of the board of governors  the fed funds rate had decreased basis points  to  and in early  the fed  in response to continuing liquidity concerns in the credit markets  further lowered the targeted federal funds rate by an additional basis points  to 
in the ensuing year  the fed in a series of rate reductions lowered the target rate to the maximum extent possible  by january  the fed funds target rate was at an unprecedented low of to  where it has remained up to the present 
we saw an immediate impact in the reduced cost of our deposits when rates began to fall in  and our deposit costs continued falling in and and to a much lesser extent throughout yields on our earning assets have also fallen in the last two years  but at least initially the drop in our asset yields was not as significant as the decline in our deposit rates 
as a result  our net interest margins generally increased in late and early  positively impacting our net interest income 
changes in the yield curve 
an additional important development with regard to the effect of rate changes on our profitability in the mid to mid period was the flattening of the yield curve  especially during and the first half of after the fed began increasing short term interest rates in june  the yield curve did not maintain its traditional upward slope ie  lower rates for shorter duration debt  higher rates for longer term debt but flattened  that is  as short term rates increased  longer term rates stayed unchanged or even decreased 
therefore  the traditional spread between short term rates and long term rates the upward yield curve essentially disappeared  ie  the curve flattened 
in late and in early  the yield curve actually i nverted  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
we  like many banks  typically fund longer duration assets with shorter maturity liabilities  and the flattening of the yield curve directly diminishes the benefit of this strategy 
the flattening of the yield curve was the most significant factor in the decrease in our net interest margin during the period and consequent downward pressure on our net interest income 
at the end of the second quarter of  however  the yield on longer term securities began to increase compared to short term investments  and the yield curve began to resume its more traditional upward sloping shape 
the increase in rate spread was further enhanced when long term rates initially held steady after the fed began lowering short term rates in september in response to the economic downturn 
ultimately  as the crisis deepened  long term rates also began to decrease  while short term rates continued to decrease  roughly in parity with each other  to the historically low levels that both short and long term rates presently occupy  levels that the federal reserve explicitly sought to perpetuate at least in the near future  through the various means at its disposal 
the upward sloping yield curve may continue  and continue to be steep  for some time  to the benefit of banks and financ ial institution generally 
on the other hand  all lending institutions  even those like us who have avoided subprime lending problems and continue to maintain high credit quality  have experienced some pressure on credit quality in recent periods  and this may continue if the national or regional economy continues to be weak 
any credit or asset quality erosion will reduce or possibly outweigh the benefit we may experience from the return of a more positively sloped yield curve and a highly favorable interest rate environment generally 
thus  no assurances can be given on future improvements in our net interest income or net income generally  particularly as consumer mortgage related borrowings have diminished across the economy and the redeployment of funds from maturing loans and assets into higher yielding assets has become progressively more difficult 
effect of rate changes on our margin 
in september  as noted above  the fed began lowering short term interest rates in response to the worsening economy 
from the third quarter of through mid our margin steadily improved as the rates we paid on our interest bearing liabilities began to reprice downward more rapidly than the yields on our earning assets 
this had a significant positive impact on our net interest income 
from mid into  our net interest margin held steady at around  but the margin began to narrow in the last three quarters of and all four quarters of as the downward repricing of paying liabilities began to slow while interest earning assets continued to reprice downward at a steady rate 
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was 
to a certain extent  further downward pricing of liab ilities is approaching a limit and will most likely not decline much further  whereas assets continue to have room to reprice downward 
if the general trend of rate reduction continues  margins  including our margin  will be under continuing pressure and slow compression may continue 
in this light  no assurances can be given that our net interest income will continue to grow  even if asset growth continues and earnings may be negatively impacted in future periods 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income  even though our net interest margin decreased by basis points from to between the two years 
this positive effect was offset  in part  to the million negative impact on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  an increase of million  or  in investment securities and a increase in the level of bank balances at interest 
within the loan portfolio  our three principal segments are residential real estate loans  indirect loans primarily automobile loans and commercial loans 
the increase in average loan balances from to was principally driven by a strong demand for residential real estate loans 
however  during the last six months of we began to sell our newly originated loans to freddie mac while retaining the loan servicing 
some of these sales were refinancing of loans that were formerly in our own portfolio 
consequently  the outstanding balance of residential real estate loans began to decrease in the fourth quarter of  continuing into the early part of average indirect loan balances decreased slightly during the year  under  while average commercial loans balances remained essentially flat 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities was evenly divided between increases in municipal deposits balances and non municipal account balances 
the fact that our average earning assets increased more than our average paying liabilities  was attributable an increase in non interest bearing funding sources  including non interest bearing demand deposits  and increases in stockholders equity 
to for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income  even though our net interest margin decreased by basis points from to between the two years 
this positive effect was in addition to the thousand positive impact on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  an increase of million  or  in investment securities and a increase in the level of overnight funds 
although the balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio began to decrease in the second half of  the average balances increased million  or  in our commercial and commercial real estate loans and increased million  or  in our residential real estate loans 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily attributable to increases in municipal deposit balances 
the fact that our average earning assets increased more than our average paying liabilities  was attributable to both an increase in non interest bearing demand deposits together with additions to stockholders equity 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations

noninterest income the majority of our noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of noninterest income 
analysis of noninterest income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gains on securities transactions other than temporary impairment otti net gain on sale of merchant bank card processing gain on visa stock redemption gain on the sale of premises income from restitution payment n a insurance commissions net gains on sales of loans other operating income total noninterest income compared to total noninterest income decreased thousand  or  from to two significant transactions involving noninterest income that occurred in were discussed in the overview beginning on page the net gain on the sale of our merchant bank card processing to transfirst in the first quarter of and  the write down of an inactively traded common stock in other transactions are listed in the table  above 
for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from the increase reflected a recovery in the dollar amount of assets under administration  largely a result of the general rebound in the us equity and debt markets between the periods 
at period end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from period end a significant portion of our fiduciary fees are indexed to the market value of assets under administration 
fees for other services to customers primarily service charges on deposit accounts  revenues related to the sale of mutual funds to our customers by third party providers and servicing income on sold loans were million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from the decrease between the two periods in fees for other services to customers was in part the result of a modest decline in revenues derived from third party mutual fund sales 
the decrease also reflected the fact that the total for the period included income from our merchant credit card processing business prior to our sale of that business at the end of the first quarter of  no income from that business was earned by us in see sale of merchant bank card processing to transfirst  in the overview section  on page 
income from debit card transactions increased from million for to million for certain provisions of dodd frank limited the size of interchange fees that large banks may charge on customers debit card transactions 
although these provisions do not directly apply to smaller community banks like ours  the law may indirectly restrict an ability to continue to charge current interchange fees because of the need to compete on price with larger banks 
on november   the federal reserve issued amendments to regulation e implementing certain provisions in the electronic fund transfer act 
the new rules  which became effective on july   among other things  set limits on the ability of banks to provide deposit customers with overdraft protection on their deposit accounts  and to charge them overdraft fees for covered overdrafts  without the customer s consent 
we believe that these new laws and rules restricting interchange fees and overdraft fees are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
our interchange fee percentage will not likely be materially reduced in upcoming periods  we believe  and debit card usage by our customers continues to grow 
moreover  we do not offer so called privilege  bounce or similar automated overdraft protection programs of the sort that led to substantial increases in overdraft fee income at certain other banks and provided the impetus for the new consumer protection regulations restricting the use of such programs by banks 
insurance commissions first became a significant source of noninterest income for us following our acquisition of an insurance agency  capital financial group  inc capital financial specializes in selling and servicing group health care policies as well as life insurance 
on april   we acquired a second insurance agency  loomis lapann  inc  which sells primarily property and casualty insurance to retail customers in our service area 
in february of  we acquired our third insurance agency  the upstate agency  which also specializes in property and casualty insurance to retail customers 
consequently  we expect that noninterest income from insurance commissions will continue to increase in upcoming periods as a result of our expansion of this line of business 
the volume of our sales of loan originations decreased after the second quarter of until the third quarter of  when we began to resell most of our newly originated residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market ie  to freddie mac 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
we are unable to predict at what rate we may continue to resell loan originations in future periods versus holding such loans and thereby augmenting our own portfolio 
much depends on the volume of originations  the rates attaching thereto  the ready availability of sales thereof into the secondary market and the pricing of such sales 
we have generally retained servicing rights for loans originated and resold by us 
compared to total noninterest income increased million from to the most significant transactions involving non interest income occurring during and were discussed in the overview beginning on page the net gain on the sale of our merchant bank card processing to transfirst in the first quarter of  the write down of our lehman bond in and of our holdings in an inactively traded common stock in and  the gain from the visa stock redemption 
for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from the decrease mirrored and resulted from a similar and significant decrease in the fair value of assets under administration and management following the severe decline in the stock markets during to the early period 
at december   the fair value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from december  a significant portion of our fiduciary fees are indexed to the average dollar amount of assets under administration and we normally expect and experience a change in our fiduciary fee income proportionate to our change in average dollar assets under administration 
an increase in stock market prices was not sufficient to achieve an overall increase in income from fiduciary activities for as compared to  since the average balance in was still well below the average balance for income from fiduciary activities includes fee income from the investment advisory services performed by our affiliated investment advisor for our proprietary mutual funds 
these mutual funds are the north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
the combined funds represented a market value of million at december   compared to million at december  fees for other services to customers primarily service charges on deposit accounts  credit card merchant fees  debit card interchange fees  revenues related to the sale of mutual funds to our customers by third party providers and servicing income on sold loans were million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from the period 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in fees we received from the merchant bank card processing business following our sale of that business in the first quarter of that decrease was offset  in part  by an increase in fees on debit cards and other fee income 
during the first quarter of  visa successfully completed an initial public offering ipo and used a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to fund a billion litigation escrow account 
as a result  in the first quarter of  our subsidiary  glens falls national  a visa member bank that is contingently liable with other member banks for certain covered visa litigation expenses  reversed litigation related accruals of thousand out of the total of thousand in pre tax charges which we had previously recognized in the fourth quarter of for such expenses 
visa used another portion of the ipo proceeds to redeem of the visa class b common stock held by each of its member banks 
as a result  we also recognized in the first quarter a pre tax gain of thousand representing the proceeds received by us from this partial redemption 
in  we sold many of our newly originated residential real estate loans to freddie mac  resulting in net gains of thousand  compared to thousand in gains for the period which is reflected in other operating income above 
other operating income also includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned  repossessed vehicles  fixed assets  as well as other miscellaneous revenues

securities held to maturity are debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings

types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial commercial real estate construction commercial real estate other consumer other consumer automobile residential real estate total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net maintenance of high quality in the loan portfolio in the second half of and throughout most of  the us experienced significant disruption and volatility in its financial and capital markets 
a major cause of the disruption was a significant decline in residential real estate values across much of the us  which  in turn  triggered widespread defaults on subprime mortgage loans and steep devaluations of portfolios containing these loans and securities collateralized by them 
in mid  as real estate values continued to fall in most areas of the us  problems spread from subprime loans to better quality mortgage portfolios  and in some cases prime mortgage loans  as well as home equity and credit card loans 
in addition  in mid to late  commercial real estate values also began to decline and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios began to experience the same problems that previously beset residential mortgage portfolios 
although the erosion of residential and commercial property values has in many markets begun to level off in recent periods  the damage to asset portfolios remains a serious concern 
many lending institutions have suffered sizable charge offs and losses in their loan and investment securities portfolios in the past two years as a result of their origination or investment in these kinds of loans or securities 
through year end  we have not experienced a significant deterioration in our loan or investment portfolios  except for two impaired securities discussed earlier on page we have never engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we do not extend or purchase any so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm  or negative equity mortgage loans 
on occasion we have made loans to borrowers having a fico score of or below or have had extensions of credit outstanding to borrowers who have developed credit problems after origination resulting in deterioration of their fico scores 
we also on occasion have extended community development loans to borrowers whose creditworthiness is below our normal standards as part of the community support program we have developed in fulfillment of our statutorily mandated duty to support low and moderate income borrowers within our service area 
however  we are a prime lender and apply prime lending standards and this  together with the fact that the service area in which we make most of our loans has not experienced as severe a decline in property values as other parts of the us  are the principal reasons that we have not experienced to date significant deterioration in the real estate categories of our loan portfolio 
if  however  weakness persists or worsens in the us or our regional economy  we may experience elevated charge offs  higher provisions to our loan loss reserve  and increasing expense related to asset maintenance and supervision 
residential real estate loans in recent years  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
in  our gross originations for residential real estate loans exceeded million  as compared to million in during the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  as prevailing mortgage rates began to decline again due primarily to the fact that the government supported entities gse  fannie mae and freddie mac  began to overwhelm the home mortgage market with their very low rate structured pricing models  we sold most of our mortgage originations in the secondary market 
during the second half of and the first two quarters of  for a variety of reasons  we once again began to retain newly originated residential real estate loans in our loan portfolio  selling only a relatively small portion of the originations to freddie mac with further offsets as a result of normal principal amortization and prepayments on pre existing loans 
after april  rates on conventional mortgages began to fall 
the national average for april was  reaching a low point with an average of for the month of october 
in response  we determined to sell most of our originations to freddie mac  amounting to million for the last half of if the current gse subsidized low rate environment for newly originated residential real estate loans persists  we may continue to elect to sell a higher portion of our loan originations and may even experience a decrease in our outstanding balances in this segment of our portfolio 
moreover  if our local economy or real estate market suffers further major downturns  the demand for residential real estate loans in our service area may decrease  which also may negatively impact our real estate portfolio and our financial perfo rmance 
indirect loans primarily automobile loans in the early post years  indirect loans primarily automobile loans originated through dealerships located primarily in the eastern region of upstate new york were the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
for much of this period  these loans were the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
in the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  we encountered enhanced rate competition on auto loans from other lenders  including finance affiliates of the auto manufacturers who increased their offerings of heavily subsidized  low or zero rate loans 
this increasingly competitive environment  combined with softening demand for vehicles  especially for suvs and light trucks  had a negative effect on our indirect originations  and we experienced decreases in these balances in the first two quarters of however  during the last two quarters of  our share of the local indirect auto loan market increased as some of the major lenders in the indirect market pulled back  including the auto companies financing affiliates 
our portfolio at december  exceeded the balance at december  by million  o r 
however  in our outstanding balances steadily declined from month to month and our ending balance at december  was million  or  below the year end balance 
nationally  automobile sales rose modestly  but steadily  during and adjusting for the spike in sales in mid under the federally subsidized cash for clunkers program 
concurrently with the increased loan demand  we introduced more competitive financing rates in the second quarter of and as a result experienced some growth in this portfolio in both the second and third quarters of  before declining again in the fourth quarter of during  the borrowers on the newly originated indirect loans had an average credit score at origination of over our experienced lending staff not only utilizes software tools but also reviews and evaluates each loan individually 
we believe our disciplined approach to evaluating risk has contributed to maintaining our strong loan quality in this portfolio 
originations of indirect loans for were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from originations for were approximately million 
these indirect loan originations represented an increase of million  or  over the originations for at december   indirect loans represented the second largest category of loans in our portfolio and a significant component of our business 
net charge offs for our consumer loans in  which are primarily indirect car loans  were actually less than our net charge offs for however  if weakness in auto demand persists  our portfolio is likely to experience limited  if any  overall growth  either in real terms or as a percentage of the total portfolio  regardless of whether the auto company affiliates continue or resume their offering of highly subsidized vehicle loans 
such weakened demand for vehicle loans could negatively impact our financial performance 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans in recent years  we have experienced moderate to strong demand for commercial and commercial real estate loans 
these loan balances have generally increased  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
however  in response to the recession  demand began to ease in and our outstanding balances at the end of were essentially unchanged from year end during the first three quarters of  commercial loan balances increased by only million  or 
substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlbny or us treasury indices 
we have not experienced any significant weakenin g in the quality of our commercial loan portfolio in recent quarters  although during that period on a national scale the commercial real estate market has begun to show signs of significant weakness 
it is entirely possible that we may experience a reduction in the demand for such loans and or a weakening in the quality of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio in upcoming periods 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category 
loan portfolio quarterly average loan balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans percentage of total quarterly average loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans quarterly tax equivalent yield on loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans other consumer loans includes certain home improvement loans secured by mortgages 
however  these same loan balances are reported as residential real estate in the table of period end balances on page  captioned types of loans 
from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  the average tax equivalent yield on our loan portfolio declined by basis points  from to  due to falling interest rates generally and heightened competitive rate pressure on new commercial and commercial real estate loans as well as automobile loans 
the yields on new year fixed rate residential real estate loans also fell during the period  but we did sell a significant portion of those originations to the secondary market  specifically  to freddie mac  as cited earlier 
the continuing trend in recent quarters  that the yield on assets declined more rapidly than our cost of funds  was discussed in more detail on page above in the section entitled impact of interest rate changes 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets is impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates 
we expect that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will continue to be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the extent of federal government and federal reserve participation in the home mortgage market  the makeup of our loan portfolio  the shape of the yield curve  consumer expectations and preferences and the rate at which the portfolio expands 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during a period of change in prevailing rates  we generally experience a time lag between the impact of the change on our deposit portfolio which is felt relatively quickly and the impact of the change on our loan portfolio which occurs more slowly 
this time lag tends to have a positive impact on net interest margins during the beginning of a rate decline period and a negative impact on the margin at the beginning of a rate increase period 
conversely  the repricing time lag tends to have a negative impact on our margins when a rate decrease period matures such has been the case in recent periods  and a positive impact on margins when a rate increase period matures 
at the present time  the prevailing expectation is that rates will remain at historically low levels for a protracted period of time  as a result of adopted and pursued strategies by the federal reserve board 
if and when rates do increase to more normal levels  however  the repricing lag between deposits and assets may be expected to have a short term negative effect on our net interest income and earnings 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
most of the real estate construction loans are made with a commitment for permanent financing  whether extended by us or unrelated third parties 
the maturity distribution below reflects the final maturity of the permanent financing

maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not funded at that time 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
c 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or mor e and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect automobile loans  million of residential real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
all our impaired loans over thousand are measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  ii the loan observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recog nition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
our method for measuring all other loans is described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  three commercial loans and one residential real estate loan over thousand were considered impaired with an average recorded investment of million 
at year end  the balance of impaired loans consisted of four loans with a combined balance of million which had no related reserve  since the fair value of the collateral exceed the carrying amount of the loans 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of thousand from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  an increase from 
at year end by way of comparison  the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for our peer group at december  was  up from at december  during  income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans  if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
during  three commercial loans over thousand were considered impaired with an average recorded investment of million 
at year end  the balance of impaired loans consisted of three loans with a combined balance of million which had no related reserve 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of thousand from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented

during  four commercial loans over thousand was considered impaired with an average recorded investment of million 
at year end  the balance of impaired loans consisted of that one loan with a balance of million which had no related reserve 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from 
at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for our peer group at december  was  up from at december  during  income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans  if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment history  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for the loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state  which in turn are impacted at least in part by economic conditions in the us generally 
on both the regional and national level  economic conditions are much weaker at present than was the case in the and earlier periods 
if weak economic conditions persist  potential problems loans likely will increase

deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits fluctuations in balances of our now accounts and time deposits of  or more are largely the result of municipal deposit fluctuations 
municipal deposits on average represent to of our total deposits 
municipal deposits are typically placed in now accounts and time deposits of short duration 
many of our municipal deposit relationships are subject to annual renewal  by formal or informal agreements 
in general  there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits starting with a low point during july and august 
account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into the winter months from tax deposits and receive an additional boost at the end of march from the electronic deposit of state funds 
in addition to these seasonal fluctuations within types of accounts  the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year to year as some municipalities move their accounts in and out of our banks due to competitive factors 
often  the balances of municipal deposits at the end of a quarter are not representative of the average balances for that quarter 
for a variety of reasons  including the seasonality of municipal deposits  we typically experience little net growth or a small contraction in average deposit balances in the first quarter of each calendar year  versus significant growth in the second and fourth quarters 
deposit balances followed this general pattern for  enhanced by the addition of new municipal account relationships throughout the year 
we also experienced growth in our non municipal account balances  primarily in now accounts and money market savings accounts 
we typically experience a shift within the mix of deposit categories during periods of significant interest rate increases or decreases 
during periods of falling rates  like the period from mid through the end of  depositors tend to transfer maturing time deposits to nonmaturity interest bearing deposit products 
this continued during at december  time deposits represented of total deposits  down from at december  this compares to recent historical lows and highs for time deposits of at june  and at june  we expect this shift from time deposits to nonmaturity deposit products to continue if rates remain at their current low levels 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are typically obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve bank 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve rate actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as demonstrated in the table above  we experienced a steady decrease in the cost of our deposits in each of the past quarters following the period of falling interest rates from mid through the end of although some maturing time deposits will continue to reprice at lower rates in forthcoming periods  the favorable reduction in the cost of deposits may not continue since most of our time deposits have already repriced to current rates and the rates on our nonmaturity deposit balances have already been reduced to or nearly to the lowest sustainable levels 
we do not use brokered deposits as a regular funding source and there were not any such balances carried during  or v

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
overnight investments in federal funds sold  interest bearing bank balances at the federal reserve bank  and cash flow from investment securities and loans  both from normal repayment cash flows and prepayments  and the ability to quickly pledge marketable investment securities and loans to obtain funds  represent our primary sources of available liquidity 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end due to the volatility in market values  we are not able to assume that large quantities of such securities could be sold at short notice at their carrying value to provide needed liquidity 
but  if market conditions are favorable resulting in unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio  we may pur sue modest sales of such securities conducted in an orderly fashion to provide needed liquidity 
in addition to liquidity from short term investments  investment securities and loans  we have supplemented available liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million  but did not draw on those lines during we participate in the overnight advance program with the fhlbny  which allows for overnight advances up to the limit of pledged collateral  including mortgage backed securities and loans 
the amount available for overnight advances amounted to million at december  during  we used this facility for a short period 
the average balance of these overnight advances was thousand for the balance in other short term borrowings at december  consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york 
in addition  we have identified brokered certificates of deposit as an appropriate off balance sheet source of funding accessible in a relatively short time period 
also  our two bank subsidiaries have each established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of overnight funds investments  available liquidity from our investment securities portfolio  cash fl ow from our loan portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences 
during the past several quarters  arrow s liquidity position has been strong  as depositors and investors in the wholesale funding markets have shown no hesitations on placing or maintaining their funds with our banks 
the financial markets have been challenging for many financial institutions  and in the view of many  lack of liquidity has been as great a problem as capital shortage 
as a result  liquidity premiums have widened and many banks have experienced certain liquidity constraints  including substantially increased pricing to retain deposit balances 
because of arrow s favorable credit quality and strong balance sheet  arrow has not experienced any significant liquidity constraints through the end of e 
capital resources and dividends stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the most significant positive changes to stockholders equity included a net income of million  b net unrealized gains in the valuation allowance for available for sale securities of thousand  net of tax  c equity received from our various stock based compensation plans of million  offset  in part by d a net retirement plan losses reflected as a component of other comprehensive income of thousand  e cash dividends of million  and f purchases of our own common stock of million 
in each of and  we enhanced our regulatory capital by issuing million of capital securities in private placements with institutional investors  utilizing a subsidiary delaware business trust for that purpose 
these trust preferred securities were reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in the past  these securities were an attractive funding vehicle  although the current financial downturn has caused trust preferred securities to become less favored from both a market and regulatory perspective 
under the federal reserve s current regulatory capital guidelines  trust preferred securities still qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues of trust preferred securities qualify in their entirety as tier regulatory capital 
there is no current consideration  to our knowledge  that trust preferred securities will lose their status as tier i capital under bank regulatory guidelines 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to stockholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
our continuing strong capital base and financial condition were key factors in our decision in january of  to decline a capital investment by the us treasury under their cpp see page 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to our holding company and subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common stockholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital for the risk based capital guidelines includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
although there is considerable current speculation in banking and financial circles that bank regulatory capital guidelines will likely be adjusted in forthcoming periods so as to require a greater degree of capital protection against sudden financial stress within banks  there is no consensus on what these enhanced capital standards will look like or over what period they will be imposed on the banking section 
the source of funds for the payment of stockholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
in addition to regulatory constrictions on payments of dividends  there are statutory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we may engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions may be used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions may be used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions may be used to manage customers requests for funding 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates interest rates or prices fees for products and services will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate and market risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco dev elops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest reasonably predictable repricing date 
we normally apply a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period 
however  at year end the targeted federal funds rate was a range of to 
for the decreasing rate simulation we applied a basis point downward shift in interest rates for the long end of th e yield curve with short term rate decreases limited at zero 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a increase in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were well within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions from september through december that resulted in a basis point decrease in prevailing rates 
we believe that decreases in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short term positive impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the mid to longer term 
we believe that increases in prevailing rates will generally have a negative impact on our margin and net interest income in the short term  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the long term 
in each case  that is  in the case of increasing or decreasing rates  the slope of the yield curve and changes in the slope of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
