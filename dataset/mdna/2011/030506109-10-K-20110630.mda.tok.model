overview american woodmark corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets 
its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers  major builders and home manufacturers and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
at april   the company operated manufacturing facilities and service centers across the country 
during the company s fiscal year that ended on april  fiscal  the company experienced a continuation of difficult housing market conditions that have prevailed since the housing market peaked five years ago 
several emerging positive factors were overshadowed by negatives 
positive factors included private sector job creation of approximately million during the company s fiscal and mortgage delinquencies  as reported by the mortgage banking association  reaching their lowest levels in two years 
negative factors included gross private residential fixed investment  as reported by the us department of commerce  declining during the third and fourth calendar quarters of and first calendar quarter of and housing starts declining by and during the three and twelve month periods ended april   respectively 
in new home construction  housing starts reached a year low of only  during fiscal  a decline of compared with million housing starts in fiscal in the remodeling market  sales of existing homes during fiscal were million homes  a reduction from the prior year s federal housing stimulus aided levels and the median home price of houses sold declined by 
although existing home sales levels have stabilized  the combination of declining home prices and elevated unemployment levels have led to relatively weak consumer confidence  causing the company s overall market to decline by approximately during fiscal  based upon sales reported by the kitchen cabinet manufacturers association 
faced with these challenging market conditions  the company s largest remodeling customers chose to utilize aggressive sales promotions during the fall and spring selling seasons to boost sales 
these promotions consisted of free products and cash discounts to consumers based upon the amount and or type of cabinets they purchased 
the company s competitors participated vigorously in these promotional activities and the company chose to meet these competitive offerings 
price conscious consumers responded favorably to these promotional offerings and the company and its large remodeling customers realized increased sales order volumes 
the company s remodeling sales rose more than in the second half of fiscal and rose in the low teens for the entire fiscal year 
the company also realized a mid single digit increase in its new construction sales during fiscal  despite the decline in housing starts 
management believes this result  combined with the company s increase in remodeling sales  indicates that the company realized market share gains in both of its sales channels during fiscal in the face of these difficult market conditions  the company s net sales  gross profit  net loss and free cash flow all improved during fiscal net sales grew by  gross margin grew by  net loss was reduced by and free cash flow defined as cash from operating activities less cash used for investing activities improved by nearly million 
despite the present housing market downturn  the company believes that the long term fundamentals for the american housing industry continue to remain positive  based upon favorable population growth  favorable demographics  job creation and low long term interest rates 
based upon this belief  the company has continued to invest in improving its operations and its capabilities to service its customers 
the company remains focused on growing its market share and has continued to invest in developing and launching new products and expanding its marketing reach to new customers 
during fiscal  the company announced cost reduction initiatives  including a salaried reduction in force  closure of two of its oldest manufacturing plants and suspension of operations in a third plant 
these initiatives were completed during the first quarter of fiscal the majority of the restructuring charges related to these actions were reflected in the company s results for fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the slight reduction in the company s gross margin rate was driven by increased sales promotion costs 
these promotions consisted of free products and cash payments to the company s large remodeling customers based upon the amount and or type of cabinets purchased 
the company s competitors participated vigorously in these promotional activities and the company chose to maintain competitive parity by participating as well 
the company regularly assesses its long lived assets to determine if any impairment has occurred and regularly evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
although the company is presently operating at a loss in what appears to be the bottom of the housing market  the company expects that improvements in market demand and continued market share gains will enable it to return to profitability well before the expiration of the useful lives of its long lived assets and any applicable tax carryforward periods 
accordingly  the company has concluded that neither its long lived assets pertaining to its manufacturing plants nor any of its other long lived assets were impaired and that no valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets was necessary as of april  restructuring charges recorded in connection with the company s cost reduction initiatives aggregated million net of tax in fiscal  million net of tax in fiscal and million net of tax in fiscal exclusive of these charges  the company generated a net loss of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal results of operations fiscal years ended april in thousands vs

average revenue per unit decreased during fiscal  driven primarily by an increased proportion of new construction sales within the company s sales mix 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the impact of increased sales volume in fiscal created improved labor efficiencies and more favorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  which were more than offset by increased sales promotion costs  diesel fuel and material costs 
specific changes and additional information included sales promotion costs increased in order to meet competitors promotional offerings to drive sales growth in a challenging market 
most of the sales promotions involved the use of free products or cash reimbursements back to the company s large retail customers and were deducted from gross margin as opposed to being classified as operating expenses

during fiscal  the company s gross profit declined as a percentage of net sales from to 
the impact of reduced sales volume in fiscal created inefficiencies from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead and in labor productivity  which more than offset the beneficial impact of reduced overhead costs related to plant closures  reduction in diesel fuel and material costs and the impact of a million insurance recovery 
specific changes and additional information included materials and freight costs decreased as a percentage of net sales by during fiscal as compared with fiscal  driven primarily by declines in diesel fuel and lumber prices  and labor and overhead costs increased by as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior fiscal year  as the decline in sales volume caused reduced productivity of direct labor and under absorption of fixed overhead costs that more than offset the million reduction in overhead driven by the company s restructuring initiatives 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses in fiscal were of net sales  compared with of net sales in fiscal the decreased cost as a percent of sales in fiscal resulted from increased sales levels  which resulted in favorable leverage 
selling and marketing expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal the higher cost as a percent of sales in fiscal was driven by a reduction in net sales that exceeded the reduction in spending as volume based reductions in compensation costs were offset in part by increased promotional costs and increased business development activities compared with the prior year 
general administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal declined by million  or  compared with fiscal and represented of net sales  compared with of net sales for fiscal the majority of the decline was related to a reduction in the company s pay for performance variable compensation and reduced bad debt and related costs pertaining to insolvent customers 
as of april   the company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating less than million 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal declined by million  or  compared with fiscal and represented of net sales  as compared with of net sales for fiscal declines associated with the company s pay for performance variable compensation program and reduced bad debt expense were partially offset by the absence of a prior fiscal year gain of million on the termination of a retiree health care plan 
as of april   the company had receivables from customers with a higher perceived level of risk aggregating million 
effective income tax rates the company generated a pre tax loss of million during fiscal based upon statutory tax rates in effect and the impact of permanent tax differences for meals and entertainment  a tax basis adjustment and other permanent differences  the company s effective tax rate was 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  reflecting the impact of statutory tax rates in effect during the years to which the pre tax loss was carried back  combined with permanent tax differences for general business credits and the domestic production deduction 
outlook for fiscal the company follows several indices  including but not limited to housing starts  existing home sales  mortgage interest rates  new jobs growth  gdp growth and consumer confidence that it believes are near term leading indicators of overall demand for kitchen and bath cabinetry 
the company believes that while these indicators collectively suggest the long term economic outlook for housing is positive  the near term outlook remains subdued 
the company expects that the economic recovery will continue at roughly its current pace and that new job creation will average approximately  per month during its fiscal this in turn should translate into a gradual improvement in consumer confidence and enable the remodeling market to be roughly neutral to slightly positive compared with prior year levels  as the benefits from increased employment continue to be hampered by uncertain home prices and credit availability 
the company believes momentum from improving employment will result in improvement in new household formation from its recent low levels 
this in turn should help improve housing starts by approximately  to a range of  to  during fiscal the company expects that it will maintain the market share gains it has made  enabling it to generate sales growth of approximately to 
the company plans to increase its capital expenditures from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  driven by increasing the number of sales display units deployed with customers and deploying machinery and equipment to enable production volume to increase 
the company expects that its operating cash flow may decline  driven by a decline in the amount of expected income tax refunds and increased working capital requirements as the company s sales grow 
the company also expects it will experience inflationary pressures in lumber  plywood and various other materials that could negatively impact profitability during fiscal additional risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report  including under forward looking statements and elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under item a  risk factors and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at april   which represented an increase of million from april  total debt was million at april   million lower than in the prior fiscal year and long term debt  excluding current maturities  to capital was at april   up from at april  the company maintains a million secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  n 
a 
wells fargo 
pursuant to the terms of the wells fargo credit facility  at april   million of the company s cash served as security for borrowings under this facility and was classified as restricted cash 
operating activities the company s main source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities 
primarily because of its non cash operating expenses that are included in net income  the company s cash provided by operating activities has historically been considerably higher than the company s net income 
during the three year period ended april   the company generated a total of million in cash from operating activities  as compared with a cumulative net loss during this period of million 
of the million difference between these two amounts  million related to non cash depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the million decrease in net loss  proceeds of million collected from income tax refunds and the absence of payments made in relation to the company s cost reduction initiatives in the prior year of approximately million 
partially offsetting these improvements were declines in the amount of non cash depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense of million and an increase in the company s net working capital investment in inventory and customer receivable levels of million 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the significant reduction in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the million increase in net loss  payments of previously accrued restructuring charges and severance costs of approximately million  the building of an income tax benefit  of which nearly million was collected during fiscal and declines in the amount of non cash depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense of million 
the company s net working capital contribution from changes in inventory and customer receivables was million less favorable in fiscal  offset by the company s utilization of pension credits that avoided the requirement to fund pension plan contributions of million 
investing activities the company s investing activities consist of capital expenditures and investments in promotional displays 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in property  plant and equipment for fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal investments in promotional displays were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the company increased its investments in capital expenditures by million and reduced its investment in promotional displays by million 
the company also received proceeds of million during fiscal from the sale of two previously closed manufacturing plants 
capital expenditures rose in fiscal as the company began to deploy machinery and equipment to facilitate increased production levels  while reductions in customers new store growth and store re merchandising activities caused the company to reduce its investment in promotional displays 
financing activities the company s financing activities typically consist of returning a portion of its free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing activities to its shareholders  repaying debt and satisfying its other credit obligations  net of any proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
the company generated free cash flow of million in fiscal  which represented an increase of million compared with fiscal the company used million for financing activities  considerably less than the million used for financing activities in fiscal the primary financing activity use of cash in fiscal was million to pay dividends to the company s common stockholders 
the company generated negative free cash flow of million in fiscal and used million for financing activities  including million to serve as security in the form of restricted cash for the company s credit facility with wells fargo and million to pay dividends 
the company generated million of free cash flow in fiscal and chose to build its cash balance by million to create additional financial flexibility  using million for financing activities  including million to pay dividends and million to repurchase stock 
under a stock repurchase authorization approved by its board of directors in  the company is authorized to repurchase its common stock from time to time  when management believes the company s liquidity and expected cash flows are ample and the market price for its common stock presents an attractive return on investment for its shareholders 
at april   approximately million remained authorized by the company s board of directors to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
the company has purchased a total of million shares of its common stock  for million  since the company made no stock repurchases in fiscal or the company can borrow up to million under the wells fargo credit facility  however  the company s aggregate debt with wells fargo cannot exceed the collateral value of the company s cash and specified investments held in accounts pledged to wells fargo 
at april   million of loans and million of letters of credit were outstanding under the wells fargo facility and million of the company s cash was held as security 
under the terms of the wells fargo credit facility  the company must maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth not greater than to and must comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at april  was to the credit facility does not limit the company s ability to use unrestricted cash to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock as long as the company maintains the required ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
as of april   the company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the credit facility 
cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements  service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for fiscal the timing of the company s contractual obligations as of april  is summarized in the table below fiscal years ended april in thousands total amounts and thereafter revolving credit facility economic development loans term loans capital lease obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations pension contributions total interest commitments under interest bearing debt consist of interest under the company s primary loan agreement  term loans and capitalized lease agreements

critical accounting policies management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to give reasonable assurance that the company s operational results and financial position are accurately and fairly reported 
the significant accounting policies of the company are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that management believes have the greatest potential impact on the presentation of the financial condition and operating results of the company for the periods being reported and that require the most judgment 
management regularly reviews these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
long lived asset impairment 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing if impairment exists  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether an impairment has occurred  the company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying values 
the company has not recognized impairments of long lived assets in the last three years 
revenue recognition 
the company utilizes signed sales agreements that provide for transfer of title to the customer upon delivery 
the company must estimate the amount of sales that have been transferred to third party carriers but not delivered to customers 
the estimate is calculated using a lag factor determined by analyzing the actual difference between shipment date and delivery date of orders over the past months 
revenue is only recognized on those shipments which the company believes have been delivered to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue based on the invoice price less allowances for sales returns  cash discounts and other deductions as required under us generally accepted accounting principles 
collection is reasonably assured as determined through an analysis of accounts receivable data  including historical product returns and the evaluation of each customer s ability to pay 
allowances for sales returns are based on the historical relationship between shipments and returns 
the company believes that its historical experience is an accurate reflection of future returns 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for certain costs related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation liability 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit total exposure 
the company establishes a liability at the balance sheet date based on estimates for a variety of factors that influence the company s ultimate cost 
in the event that actual experience is substantially different from the estimates  the financial results for the period could be adversely affected 
the company believes that the methodologies used to estimate all factors related to employee medical coverage and workers compensation are an accurate reflection of the liability as of the date of the balance sheet 
pensions 
the company has two non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of the company s employees 
the estimated cost  benefits and pension obligation of these plans are determined using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligations and the future rate of compensation level increases 
in fiscal  the company determined the discount rate by referencing the hewitt above median yield curve 
previously  the company referred to the aon yield curve in establishing the discount rate 
the company believes that using a yield curve approach more accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the current mix of the plan assets invested in equities and bonds 
the future rate of compensation levels reflects expected compensation trends 
the following is a summary of the potential impact of a hypothetical change in actuarial assumptions for the discount rate  rate of compensation  expected return on plan assets and consumer price index in millions impact of increase impact of decrease decrease increase effect on annual pension expense effect on projected pension benefit obligation pension expense for fiscal and the assumptions used in that calculation are presented in note h of the consolidated financial statements 
at april   the discount rate was compared to at april  the expected return on plan assets is  which is consistent with fiscal the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels is for the fiscal year ended april   unchanged from the prior fiscal year 
the performance of the company s pension plans is largely dependent on the assumptions used to measure the obligations of the plans and to estimate future performance of the plans invested assets 
over the past two measurement periods  the most material deviations between results based on assumptions and the actual plan performance have been as a result of the changes to the discount rate used to measure the plans benefit obligations and the actual return on plan assets 
under accounting guidelines  the discount rate is to be set to market at each annual measurement date 
from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from to  which was the primary driver in an actuarial loss of million 
from the fiscal to fiscal measurement dates  the discount rate decreased from to  which was the primary driver in the actuarial loss of million 
the company strives to balance expected long term returns and short term volatility of pension plan assets 
favorable and unfavorable differences between the assumed and actual returns on plan assets are generally amortized over a period no longer than the average future working lifetime of the plans active participants 
the actual rates of return on plan assets realized  net of investment manager fees were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fair value of plan assets at april  was million compared to million at april  the company s projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets by million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s million increase in its net under funded position during fiscal was driven by the company s million actuarial losses due to the decrease in the discount rate used and a million loss due to additional benefits accruing  offset in part by a higher actual return on plan assets than expected 
the company expects its pension expense to increase from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to a further decrease in the discount rate offset by a higher return on plan assets than expected 
the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans in fiscal  which represents both required and discretionary funding 
under the requirements of the pension protection act of  the company was not required to make mandatory contributions to its pension plans in either fiscal or in fiscal promotional displays 
the company invests in promotional displays in retail stores to demonstrate product features  product specifications  quality specifications and serve as a training tool for designers 
the investment is carried at cost less applicable amortization 
amortization is provided by the straight line method on an individual display basis over the estimated period of economic benefit  approximately to months 
the company believes that the estimated period of economic benefit provides an accurate reflection of the value of displays as of the date of the balance sheet based on historical experience 
product warranty 
the company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues 
the warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the company s remaining obligation based on anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period 
adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
warranty claims are generally made within three months of the original shipment date 
stock based compensation expense 
the calculation of stock based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit award granted 
stock option awards are estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
for performance based restricted stock units  the company estimates the number of shares that will be granted upon satisfaction of the performance conditions  based upon actual and expected future operating results 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on stock based compensation 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company performed an analysis at april  and and determined in each case that a valuation allowance was not required 
the company considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
based upon this analysis  including a consideration of recent losses  management determined that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized through expected future income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
the company will continue to update this analysis on a periodic basis and changes in expectations about future income or the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences could cause the company to record a valuation allowance in a future period 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu amends subtopic to clarify existing disclosures  require new disclosures and includes conforming amendments to guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plans

the cash dividend was paid on june   to shareholders of record on june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the costs of the company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations 
the company has generally been able  over time  to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases 
on april   the company had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements 
the company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks
