critical accounting policies our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to accounting measurements and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
when applying accounting policies in areas that are subjective in nature  we must use our best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
one of the most critical accounting policies applied by us is related to the valuation of our loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of our loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the amount and amortization of loan fees and deferred origination costs 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a complex process containing estimates which are inherently subjective and susceptible to significant revision as current information becomes available 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level we believe is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of our regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and peer comparisons 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in the economic and interest rate environment which may impact a borrower s ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to the tri county region we serve in southeast florida 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on our estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed as part of loan portfolio  asset quality and allowance for loan losses and in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
regulation and legislation as a state chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the florida office of financial regulation  or florida ofr  and the fdic 
we file reports with the florida ofr and the fdic concerning our activities and financial condition  in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions 
periodic examinations are performed by the florida ofr and the fdic to monitor our compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to regulation and examination by the federal reserve board of governors 

table of contents loan portfolio  asset quality and allowance for loan losses our primary business is making real estate loans 
this activity may subject us to potential loan losses  the magnitude of which depends on a variety of economic factors affecting borrowers which are beyond our control 
for the past several years  there has been a dramatic decrease in housing and real estate values in south florida  coupled with a significant increase in the rate of unemployment 
with most of our loans concentrated in south florida  the decline in local economic conditions has adversely affected the values of our real estate collateral 
these trends have contributed to an increase in our impaired loans and reduced asset quality 
as of december   our impaired loans were approximately million  or of the net loan portfolio 
impaired loans and real estate owned were approximately million as of this same date  or of total assets 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolio and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the market value of our loan portfolio  the losses associated with impaired loans  and the net realizable value of real estate owned

table of contents the following table sets forth the activity in the allowance for loan losses in thousands year ended december  beginning balance provision for loan losses loans charged off recoveries ending balance the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses represented and of the total loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
we evaluate the allowance for loan losses on a regular basis 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our periodic review of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  historical loan loss experiences  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of two components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
we measure impairment on a loan by loan basis for all our loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 

table of contents the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss experience for that category adjusted for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and other trends or uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable loss 
the aggregate of these two components results in our total allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth our allowance for loan losses by loan type dollars in thousands at december  amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding at december  amount of total loans amount of total loans residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding

nonaccrual and past due loans were as follows as of december    and in thousands at december  nonaccrual loans past ninety days or more  but still accruing interest liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet current and future obligations through liquidation or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional liabilities 
our ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to benefit from investment opportunities is facilitated through liquidity management 

table of contents our primary sources of cash during the year ended december  were from principal repayments of securities held to maturity of million  proceeds from the sale of securities held to maturity of million and net repayments of loans of million 
cash was used primarily to purchase securities held to maturity totaling million and repayment of federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements of million 
in order to increase our core deposits  we have priced our deposit rates competitively 
we will adjust rates on our deposits to attract or retain deposits as needed 
in addition to obtaining funds from depositors in our market area  from time to time we have utilized brokers to obtain deposits outside our market area 
in addition to obtaining funds from depositors  we may borrow funds from other financial institutions 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which allows us to borrow funds under a pre arranged line of credit equal to million 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding from the federal home loan bank of atlanta to facilitate loan fundings and manage our asset and liability structure 
securities our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage backed securities 
the securities portfolio is categorized as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities held to maturity represent those securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
these securities are carried at amortized cost 
securities available for sale represent those investments which may be sold for various reasons including changes in interest rates and liquidity considerations 
these securities are reported at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio in thousands amortized cost fair value at december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities foreign bond at december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities foreign bond at december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities foreign bond security available for sale mutual fund

this action was taken in an effort to comply with a significant increase in the regulatory capital requirements imposed on the bank under the consent order issued by the fdic and florida office of financial regulation at december   million of the million in mortgage backed securities mbs were us agency mbs and million were private label mbs 
approximately million of the private label mbs at december  were rated sub investment grade securities by the securities rating agencies 
in general  non investment grade securities cannot be used to collateralize borrowings and are considered to be substandard assets by the federal regulatory agencies 
regulatory capital adequacy failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and  possibly  additional discretionary actions by federal and state regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
in addition  the consent order imposes increased minimum capital requirements on the bank 
quantitative measures established by regulation and by the consent order to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets 
as of december   we did not meet the minimum applicable capital adequacy requirements 
see supervision and regulation bank regulation capital adequacy requirements 

table of contents as of december   our actual and required minimum capital ratios were as follows in thousands regulatory capital requirements actual for capital adequacy purposes minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions requirements of consent order amount amount amount amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to total assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a tier i capital to total assets n a n a actual for capital adequacy purposes minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions amount amount amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to total assets market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
we do not engage in securities trading or hedging activities and do not invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
we may utilize financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while adjusting our asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure by managing our asset and liability structure 
however  a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings  to the extent that the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change or reprice at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we use modeling techniques to simulate changes in net interest income under various rate scenarios 
important elements of these techniques include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities  and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of the existing balance sheet 
asset liability management as part of our asset and liability management  we have emphasized establishing and implementing internal asset liability decision processes  as well as control procedures to aid in managing our earnings 
management believes that these processes and procedures provide us with better capital planning  asset mix and volume controls  loan pricing guidelines  and deposit interest rate guidelines  which should result in tighter controls and less exposure to interest rate risk 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
the gap ratio is computed as the amount of rate sensitive assets less the amount of rate sensitive liabilities divided by total assets 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on the results of operations  our management continues to monitor our assets and liabilities to better match the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our policies emphasize the origination of adjustable rate loans  building a stable core deposit base and  to the extent possible  matching deposit maturities with loan repricing timeframes or maturities 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain information relating to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   that are estimated to mature or are scheduled to reprice within the period shown dollars in thousands gap maturity repricing schedule one year or less more than one year and less than five years more than five years and less than fifteen years over fifteen years total loans residential real estate loans multi family real estate loans commercial real estate loans land and construction consumer loans total loans federal funds sold securities federal home loan bank stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts money market deposits interest bearing checking deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debenture total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets in preparing the table above  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which the interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which the loans mature 
fixed rate loans are scheduled  including repayment  according to their maturities 
securities are scheduled through the repricing date 
money market  interest bearing checking and savings deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts 
all other time deposits are scheduled through the maturity dates 

table of contents the following table sets forth loan maturities by type of loan at december  in thousands one year or less after one but within five years after five years total residential real estate multi family real estate commercial real estate land and construction consumer total the following table sets forth the maturity or repricing of loans by interest type at december  in thousands one year or less after one but within five years after five years total fixed interest rate variable interest rate total scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells real property subject to a mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are substantially higher than current mortgage rates 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to originate real estate loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contractual amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since certain commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if we deem it necessary in order to extend credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 

table of contents the following is a summary of the bank s contractual obligations  including certain on balance sheet obligations  at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debenture operating leases total deposits deposits traditionally are the primary source of funds for our use in lending  making investments and meeting liquidity demands 
we have focused on raising time deposits primarily within our market area  which is the tri county area of broward  miami dade and palm beach counties 
however  we offer a variety of deposit products  which we promote within our market area 
net deposits decreased million in and increased million in we have used brokered deposits to facilitate mortgage loan fundings in circumstances when larger than anticipated loan volumes occur and there is limited time to fund the additional loan demand through traditional deposit solicitation 
in general  brokered deposits can be obtained in one to three days 
the rates paid on these deposits are typically equal to or slightly less than the high end of the interest rates in our market area 
brokered deposits amounted to million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
we have reduced our reliance on brokered deposits which are considered a more volatile source of funding by no longer accepting or rolling over existing brokered deposits

the following table sets forth our maturity distribution of deposits of  or more at december  and in thousands at december  due three months or less due more than three months to six months more than six months to one year one to five years total analysis of results of operations our profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the difference between yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and deposit flows 
our results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses including income taxes  and noninterest income such as loan prepayment fees

net loss for the year ended december   was  or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  this million decrease in the company s net loss was primarily due to a  decrease in the provision for loan losses partially offset by a net million expense associated with downsizing the company  a million reduction in income tax benefit and a million increase in professional fees associated with loan foreclosures  workouts  and regulatory matters 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased to million due primarily to a decrease in the average loan portfolio balance and a decrease in the average yield earned in due to an increase in the average balance of non performing loans in interest on securities decreased by million due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of the securities portfolio in interest expense

provision for loan losses 
the provision for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the same period in the provision for loan losses is charged to operations as losses are estimated to have occurred in order to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by us  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  loans identified as impaired  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the estimated collectability of our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of loans outstanding at december   compared to million  or of loans outstanding at december  the decrease in the allowance was due to the use of specific reserves for charge offs of loans deemed uncollectible 
management believes the balance in the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  primarily due to gains recognized on the sale of securities as part of the downsizing of the company in the first quarter of and an other than temporary impairment on securities recorded for  in noninterest expenses 
total noninterest expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a loss on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the company s downsizing  and an increase in professional fees due to legal and consulting expenses associated with loan foreclosure  loan workouts  and regulatory matters  and write downs on foreclosed real estate  all occurring in the period

total noninterest income expense decreased to  for  from  for primarily as a result of a decrease in loan prepayment fees  late charge fees and an other than temporary impairment on securities of  in noninterest expenses 
total noninterest expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily due to a special assessment by the federal deposit insurance corporation of  in income taxes benefit 
income tax benefit for  was  an effective rate of compared to income taxes of  an effective rate of for impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates
