item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we continue to make significant investments to expand our global sales  marketing  technical applications support  and distribution capabilities to further enable new and existing customers to implement led and power technology into their products 
we also continue to make investments to build market awareness of the cree brand 
our direct sales and marketing team is headquartered in north carolina 
we have a growing international sales  marketing and technical applications team  including personnel in the following locations austria malaysia australia singapore canada south korea china sweden france taiwan germany turkey italy united kingdom japan united states this year  we have started to implement our thermal  electrical  mechanical  photometric  and optical tempo performance testing program to assist our customers in developing high quality led based products 
customers we have historically had a few key customers who represented more than of our consolidated revenues 
in fiscal  revenues from two of our distribution customers  arrow electronics  inc arrow and world peace industrial co  ltd 
world peace  exceeded of our total consolidated revenues 
sales to arrow and world peace represented and of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal  respectively 
for further discussion regarding customer concentration  please see note  concentrations of risk  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the loss of any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
distribution a substantial portion of our products are sold to distributors 
distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base  which may include value added resellers  manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods  or ultimate end users of our products 
we also utilize third party sales representatives who generally do not maintain a product inventory  instead  their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 
seasonality sales of our products are generally not subject to seasonality 
our sales do vary based on other factors such as customer demand and government regulation 
if anticipated sales or shipments do not occur when expected  our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  may be adversely affected 
backlog our backlog at june   the last day of our fiscal year  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of approximately million at june   the last day of our fiscal year 
because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation 
table of contents of orders which at times may be made without significant penalty  we do not believe that our backlog  as of any particular date  is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 
additionally  our june  backlog figure contains million of research contracts signed with the us government  for which approximately million were not appropriated as of the last day of fiscal our june  backlog figure contains million of research contracts signed with the us government  for which approximately million were not appropriated as of the last day of fiscal our backlog could be adversely affected if the us government exercises its rights to terminate our government contracts or does not appropriate and allocate all of the funding contemplated by the contracts 
sources of raw materials we depend on a number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in our products  including certain key materials and equipment used in our crystal growth  wafering  polishing  epitaxial deposition  device fabrication  component and lighting assembly processes 
we generally purchase these limited source items pursuant to purchase orders and have limited guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
our suppliers  located around the world  can be subject to many constraints limiting supply that are beyond our control 
we believe our current supply of essential materials is sufficient to meet our needs 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
competition our success depends on our ability to keep pace with the evolving technology standards of the industries we serve 
these industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  changes in end user and customer requirements  and a competitive pricing environment 
the evolving nature of these industries may render our existing or future products obsolete  noncompetitive or unmarketable 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
led products led chips the primary competition for our led chip products comes from companies that manufacture and or sell nitride based led chips 
we consider nichia corporation nichia to be a competitor because it sells led chips to a select number of led packaging companies and it sells packaged leds that most often compete directly with our chip customers 
we believe  based on industry information  that nichia currently has the largest market share for nitride based leds 
there are many other led chip producers who sell blue  green and white led chip products  including osram semiconductor gmbh osram  toyoda gosei co  ltd  and epistar corporation 
these competitors make products for a variety of applications in a range of performance levels that compete directly with our led chip products 
overall  we believe that performance  price and strength of intellectual property are the most significant factors to compete successfully in the nitride led market 
we believe our products are well positioned to meet the market performance requirements  however  there is significant pricing pressure from a number of competitors 
we continually strive to improve our competitive position by developing brighter and higher performing led chips while focusing on lowering costs 
led components the market for lighting class led components is concentrated primarily in indoor and outdoor commercial lighting  specialty lighting  including torch lamps flashlights  color changing architectural lighting  signs and signals  and emergency vehicle lighting for example  fire and rescue vehicles 
nichia  osram and philips lumileds lighting company  llc are the main competitors in this market 
these companies sell led components that compete indirectly with our target customers for led chips and compete directly with our xlamp led components 
several other companies have products designed to compete with our xlamp led components  including avago technologies 
table of contents limited  edison opto corporation  kingbright corporation  samsung led company samsung  and seoul semiconductor co  ltd 
we are positioning our xlamp led components to compete in this market based on performance  price and usability 
our high brightness led components compete with a larger number of competitors around the world in a variety of applications including signage  video  automotive  gaming and specialty lighting 
we are positioning our high brightness led components to compete in this market based on performance  price  availability and usability 
led lighting our led lighting products currently face competition from traditional lighting fixture companies  lamp manufacturers and from non traditional companies focused on led lighting systems including fixtures and bulbs 
our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent  fluorescent  halogen  ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology 
our led lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings  extended life  improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership 
also  our led lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury 
we also compete with led based products from traditional and non traditional lamp and fixture companies  some of whom are customers for our led chips and led components 
our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency  superior light output  reduced energy consumption  brand and lower total cost of ownership 
sic wafers we have continued to maintain our well established quality and volume leadership position in the sale of sic wafer and sic and gan epitaxy products 
we are seeing increased competition in this market 
power and rf products power devices our sic based power devices compete with similar devices offered by infineon technologies ag  stmicroelectronics  and rohm co  ltd 
there are also a number of other companies developing sic based power devices 
in addition  our products compete with existing silicon based power devices offered by a variety of manufacturers 
rf devices currently  sumitomo electric device innovations  inc is the main company offering products that compete directly with our sic mesfet and gan hemt products  although several other companies such as rf micro devices inc  nitronex corporation and triquint corporation have products that compete with us as well 
our products also face competition from existing silicon and gaas based products 
patents and other intellectual property rights we believe it is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  including rights under patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws 
we seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the united states and other countries when appropriate 
we have also acquired  through license grants and assignments  rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others 
as of june   we owned or held exclusive rights under issued us patents and approximately  foreign patents with various expiration dates extending up to we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any one patent  and we believe our business will not be materially adversely affected by the expiration of any one patent 
for proprietary technology that is not patented  we generally seek to protect the technology and related know how and information as trade secrets by keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive 
table of contents advantage 
we attempt to create strong brands for our products and promote our products through trademarks that distinguish them in the market 
we may license our customers to use our trademarks in connection with the sale of our products  and we monitor for the proper and authorized use of our marks 
licensing activities and lawsuits to enforce intellectual property rights  particularly patent rights  are a common feature of the semiconductor and led industries  and we attempt to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights through appropriate actions 
the breadth of our intellectual property rights and the extent to which they can be successfully enforced vary across jurisdictions 
we both make and receive inquiries regarding possible patent infringements and possible violations of other intellectual property rights in the normal course of business 
depending on the circumstances  we may seek to negotiate a license or other acceptable resolution 
if we are unable to achieve a resolution by agreement  we may seek to enforce our rights or defend our position through litigation 
patent litigation in particular is expensive and the outcome is often uncertain 
we believe that the strength of our portfolio of patent rights is important in helping us resolve or avoid such disputes with other companies in our industry 
environmental regulation we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes 
failure to comply with such provisions could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties  injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
working capital for a discussion of our working capital practices  see liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report 
employees as of june   we employed approximately  regular full and part time employees 
we also employ individuals on a temporary full time basis and use the services of contractors as necessary 
certain of our employees in various countries outside of the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to these employees 
we consider relations with our employees to be good

risk factors 
table of contents described below are various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business 
if any of the risks described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant challenges managing our growth as the market adopts leds for general lighting 
our potential for growth depends significantly on the adoption of leds within the general lighting market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption 
although led lighting has grown rapidly in recent years  adoption of leds for general lighting is relatively new  still limited and faces significant challenges before widespread adoption 
in order to manage our growth and business strategy effectively in light of uncertainty related to the pace of adoption  we must continue to maintain  expand and purchase adequate manufacturing facilities and equipment to meet customer demand  maintain a sufficient supply of raw materials to support our growth  expand research and development  sales and marketing  technical support  distribution capabilities and administrative functions  expand the skills and capabilities of our current management team  add experienced senior level managers  and attract and retain qualified employees 
while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses  over the long term we expect to invest substantially to support our growth and may have additional unexpected costs 
for example  we purchased a  square foot facility in huizhou  guangdong province  china to support led chip and led component production in  and we are targeting to expand led wafer production at our facility in north carolina 
however  such investments take time to become fully operational  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit targeted market opportunities 
there are also inherent execution risks in starting up a new factory or expanding production capacity that could increase costs and reduce our operating results  including design and construction cost overruns  poor production process yields and reduced quality control during the start up phase 
we are also increasingly dependent on information technology to enable us to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency 
if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build  implement and sustain the proper technology infrastructure  we could be subject to transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  loss of customers  business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 
in connection with our efforts to cost effectively manage our growth  we have increasingly relied on contractors for production capacity  logistics support and certain administrative functions including hosting of certain information technology software applications 
if these service providers do not perform effectively  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors or fulfill customer demand 
depending on the function involved  such errors may also lead to business disruption  processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach  or impact employee morale 
our operations may also be negatively impacted if any of these service providers do not have the financial capability to meet our growing needs 
if we are unable to effectively develop  manage and expand our distribution channels for our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have expanded into business channels that are different from those in which we have historically operated as we grow our business and sell led lighting products and more led components versus led chips 
if we are unable to effectively penetrate these channels or develop alternate channels to ensure our products are reaching the appropriate customer base  our financial results may be adversely impacted 
in addition  if we successfully penetrate or develop these channels  we cannot guarantee that customers will accept our products or that we will be able to manufacture and deliver them in the timeline established by our customers 
we sell a substantial portion of our products to distributors 
we rely on distributors to develop and expand their customer base as well as anticipate demand from their customers 
if they are not successful  our growth and profitability may be adversely impacted 
distributors must balance the need to have enough products in stock in order to meet their customers needs against their internal target inventory levels and the risk of potential inventory obsolescence 

table of contents the risks of inventory obsolescence are especially true with technological products 
the distributors internal target inventory levels vary depending on market cycles and a number of factors within each distributor over which we have very little  if any control 
also  the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan has disrupted demand and may contribute to uncertainty for our distributors that sell to customers within this region 
we typically recognize revenue on product sold to distributors when the item is shipped and title passes to the distributor sell in method 
certain distributors have limited rights to return inventory under stock rotation programs and have limited price protection rights for which we make estimates 
we evaluate inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends and other related factors in order to account for these factors in our judgments and estimates 
as inventory levels and product return trends change  we revise our estimates and our operating results could be impacted 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and have evolving technical requirements 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
in the led market  we compete with companies that manufacture or sell led chips and led components as well as those that sell led lighting products 
competitors continue to offer new led products with aggressive pricing and improved performance 
competitive pricing pressures may change and could accelerate the rate of decline of our average sales prices 
with the growth potential for leds  we may face increased competition in the future 
for example  samsung and many other companies have entered the led market 
if the investment in new capacity exceeds the growth in demand  the led market is likely to become more competitive with additional pricing pressures 
additionally  new technologies could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that may also reduce the demand for leds in certain markets 
as competition increases  in order to continue to grow our business  we need to continue to develop new products that meet or exceed the needs of our customers 
additionally  we anticipate that increased competition will result in pressure to lower the selling prices of our products 
therefore  our ability to continually produce more efficient  higher brightness leds that meet the evolving needs of our customers at lower costs will be critical to our success 
competitors may also try to align with some of our strategic customers 
this could mean lower prices for our products  reduced demand for our products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development  engineering and manufacturing costs 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we depend on a limited number of customers  including distributors  for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by  one or more of these customers could adversely affect our operating results 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers  including distributors 
most of our customer orders are made on a purchase order basis  which does not generally require any long term customer commitments 
therefore  these customers may alter their past purchasing behavior with little or no notice to us for various reasons  including developing  or  in the case of our distributors  their customers developing  their own product solutions  choosing to purchase product from our competitors  incorrectly forecasting end market demand for their products  or experiencing a reduction in their market share in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if our customers alter their past or expected purchasing behavior  or if we encounter any problems collecting amounts due from them  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we operate in an industry that is subject to significant fluctuation in supply and demand that affects our led revenue and profitability 
the led lighting industry is in the early stages of adoption and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant fluctuations  often in connection with  or in anticipation of product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these fluctuations have been characterized by lower product demand  production overcapacity  higher inventory levels and increased pricing pressure 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past  are currently experiencing these conditions  and may experience such conditions in the future  which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations 

table of contents our results of operations  financial condition and business could be harmed if we are unable to balance customer demand and capacity 
as customer demand for our products changes  we must be able to ramp up or adjust our production capacity to meet demand 
we are continually taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity needs for our products 
for example  we purchased a  square foot facility in huizhou  guangdong province  china to support led chip and led component production in and continue to expand led wafer production at our facility in north carolina 
if we are not able to increase our production capacity at our targeted rate  or if there are unforeseen costs associated with adjusting our capacity levels  we may not be able to achieve our financial targets 
conversely  due to the proportionately high fixed cost nature of our business such as facility expansion costs  if demand does not increase at the rate forecasted  we may not be able to manage manufacturing expenses or overhead costs at the same rate as demand 
this could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations 
additionally  if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately  we may be required to record impairments on our long lived assets or record excess inventory write off charges 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to record excess capacity charges  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  our efforts to improve quoted delivery lead time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog 
a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter to quarter net sales and operating results 
if we fail to evaluate and execute strategic opportunities successfully  our business may suffer 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities available to us for product  technology or business transactions  such as business acquisitions or divestitures 
for example  in march we acquired cotco luminant device limited  a hong kong company now cree hong kong limited cotco  and in february we acquired led lighting fixtures  inc llf 
if we choose to enter into such transactions  we face certain risks  such as the failure of an acquired business to meet our performance expectations  diversion of management attention  retention of existing customers of our current and acquired businesses due to concerns that new product lines may be in competition with the customers of existing product lines or otherwise  and difficulty integrating an acquired business s operations  personnel and financial and operating systems into our current business 
we may not be able to adequately address these risks or any other problems that arise from our recent or future acquisitions or divestitures 
any failure to successfully evaluate strategic opportunities and address risks or other problems that arise related to any such business transaction could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of our continued expansion into new markets existing customers may reduce orders 
through acquisitions and organic growth  we continue to expand into new markets 
in these new markets  some of our current customers may now perceive us as a competitor 
in response  our customers may reduce their orders for our products 
this reduction in orders could occur faster than our sales growth in these new markets  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our led revenues are highly dependent on our customers ability to produce  market and sell more integrated products using our led products 
because our customers generally integrate our led products into the products that they produce  market and sell  our led revenues depend on getting our led products designed into a larger number of our customers products and in turn  our customers ability to produce  market and sell their led products 
for example  we have current and prospective customers that create  or plan to create  lighting systems using our led components 
however  the traditional lighting industry is still developing technical expertise with led related designs  which may limit the success of our customers products 
even if our customers are able to develop and produce led lighting products  there can be no assurance that our customers will be successful in marketing and selling these products in the marketplace 
we also have current and prospective customers that create white led components using our blue leds  in combination with phosphors 
sales of blue led chips are highly dependent upon our customers ability to procure efficient phosphors  develop high quality and highly efficient white led components and gain access to the necessary intellectual property rights 
even if our customers are able to develop competitive white led components using our blue led chips  there can be no assurance that our customers will be successful in the marketplace 
the adoption of or changes in government and or industry policies  standards or regulations relating to the efficiency  performance or other aspects of led lighting or changes in government and or industry policies  standards or regulations that discourage the use of certain traditional lighting technologies  could impact the demand for our led products 
the adoption of or changes in government and or industry policies  standards or regulations relating to the efficiency  performance or other aspects of led lighting may impact the demand for our led products 
for example  in the second half of calendar year the chinese government delayed purchases of led street and tunnel lighting while developing new standards for the required performance for such lighting products in china 
the process resulted in reduced demand for those lighting applications and continues to limit our ability to forecast demand for those applications in the short term 

table of contents demand for our led products may also be impacted by changes in government and or industry policies  standards or regulations that discourage the use of certain traditional lighting technologies 
for example  the energy independence and security act of in the united states imposes constraints on the sale of incandescent lights beginning in these constraints may be eliminated or delayed by legislative action  which could have a negative impact on demand for our products 
if governments or their agencies discontinue or curtail their funding  or reduce their demand for our products  our business may suffer 
changes in governmental budget priorities could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
historically  us government agencies have funded a portion of our research and development activities 
in addition  us and foreign government agencies have purchased products directly from us and products from our customers for which we supply components 
when the government changes budget priorities  such as in times of war or financial crisis  our research and development funding and our product sales are at risk 
for example  the us government s credit rating was recently downgraded to aa by one of the leading rating agencies 
further  demand and payment for our products and our customers products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations 
funding reductions or delays could negatively impact demand for our products 
in particular  if us government funding is discontinued or significantly reduced  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
variations in our production yields could impact our ability to reduce costs and could cause our margins to decline and our operating results to suffer 
all of our products are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex 
the number of usable items  or yield  from our production processes may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including but not limited to the following variability in our process repeatability and control  contamination of the manufacturing environment  equipment failure  power outages  system failures or variations in the manufacturing process  lack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts and other raw materials  and other bill of materials items  production yield loss  inventory shrinkage or human errors  defects in production processes including system assembly either within our facilities or at our contractors  and any transitions or changes in our production process  planned or unplanned 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on certain products  which has adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future  and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
in addition  our ability to convert volume manufacturing to larger diameter substrates can be an important factor in allowing for a more cost effective manufacturing process 
if we are unable to make this transition in a timely or cost effective manner  our results could be negatively impacted 
in some instances  we may offer products for future delivery at prices based on planned yield improvements or increased cost efficiencies from other production advances 
failure to achieve these planned improvements or advances could significantly affect our margins and operating results 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business 
a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a natural disaster  health pandemic  such as an influenza outbreak within our workforce  or man made catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales  continuing production or performing other critical functions of our business  especially in the case of our single site for sic wafer and led fabrication 
a catastrophic event  such as the japan earthquake and tsunami in march may result in disruption to our direct sales or those of our distributors  our supply chain  or to any of our critical business or information technology systems 
this could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
there may also be secondary impacts that are unforeseeable as well  such as impacts to our customers and their supply chain  which could cause delays in new orders  delays in completing sales or even order cancellations 
for instance  the recent earthquakes and tsunami in japan have disrupted demand within the market and could negatively impact our backlog 

table of contents our operating results are substantially dependent on the development and acceptance of new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop new and lower cost solutions for existing and new markets and for customers to accept those solutions 
we must introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner  and we must secure production orders for those products from our customers 
the development of new products is a highly complex process  and we historically have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems  and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful 
the successful development and introduction of these new products depends on a number of factors  including the following achievement of technology breakthroughs required to make commercially viable devices  the accuracy of our predictions for market requirements beyond near term visibility  our ability to predict  influence  and or react to evolving standards  acceptance of our new product designs  acceptance of new technology in certain markets  the availability of qualified research and development personnel  our timely completion of product designs and development  our ability to expand direct customer sales and influence key distribution customers to adopt our products  our ability to develop repeatable processes to manufacture new products in sufficient quantities  with the desired specifications and at competitive costs for commercial sales  our ability to effectively transfer products and technology developed in one country to our manufacturing facilities in other countries  our customers ability to develop competitive products incorporating our products  and acceptance of our customers products by the market 
if any of these or other factors becomes problematic  we may not be able to develop and introduce these new products in a timely or cost effective manner 
if our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations  we could incur significant additional costs  including costs associated with the recall of those items 
the manufacture of our products involves highly complex processes 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to replace or rework the products 
in some cases  our products may contain undetected defects or flaws that only become evident after shipment 
even if our products meet standard specifications  our customers may attempt to use our products in applications they were not designed for or in products that were not designed or manufactured properly  resulting in product failures and creating customer satisfaction issues 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time and defects or failures may occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we may need to recall our products 
these recalls could result in significant losses due to 
table of contents costs associated with the removal  collection and destruction of the product recalled  payments made to replace recalled product  a rise in warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  the write down or destruction of existing inventory subject to the recall  lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  or increased product returns 
we also may be the target of product liability lawsuits  and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us if the use of our products at issue is determined to have caused injury 
a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity  damage to our reputation  and a loss of customer confidence in our products 
our operations in foreign countries  including china and other asian countries  expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of acquisitions and organic growth  we have operations  manufacturing facilities and contract manufacturing arrangements in foreign countries that expose us to certain risks 
for example  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect our revenues  expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our financial statements 
we are also subject to other types of risks  including the following protection of intellectual property and trade secrets  tariffs  customs and other barriers to importing exporting materials and products in a cost effective and timely manner  timing and availability of export licenses  rising labor costs  disruptions in or inadequate infrastructure of the foreign countries where we operate  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  the burden of complying with foreign and international laws and treaties  and the burden of complying with and changes in international taxation policies 
in some instances  we have been provided and may continue to receive competing incentives from foreign governments to encourage our investment in certain countries  regions  or areas outside of the united states 
in particular  we have received and may continue to receive such incentives in connection with our operations in asia  as asian national and local governments seek to encourage the development of the technology industry 
government incentives may include tax rebates  reduced tax rates  favorable lending policies and other measures  some or all of which may be available to us due to our foreign operations 
any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time 
any reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our operations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
these same governments also may provide increased incentives to or require production processes that favor local companies  which could further negatively impact our business and results of operations 
abrupt political change  terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries  which could also result in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
litigation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are often involved in patent infringement litigation as described in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
defending against existing and potential litigation will likely require significant attention and resources and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses  which could adversely affect our results unless covered by insurance or recovered from third parties 
if our defenses are ultimately unsuccessful  or if we are unable to achieve a favorable resolution  we could be liable for damage awards that could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
where necessary  we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day to day operations 
moreover  there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation 

table of contents our business may be impaired by claims that we  or our customers  infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize our industry 
these traits have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
litigation to determine the validity of patents or claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights could result in significant legal expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  even if the litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of products found to be infringing  incur asset impairment charges  discontinue the use of processes found to be infringing  expend significant resources to develop non infringing products or processes  or obtain a license to use third party technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not attempt to assert infringement claims against us  or our customers  with respect to our products 
in addition  our customers may face infringement claims directed to the customer s products that incorporate our products  and an adverse result could impair the customer s demand for our products 
we have also promised certain of our customers that we will indemnify them in the event they are sued by our competitors for infringement claims directed to the products we supply 
under these indemnification obligations  we may be responsible for future payments to resolve infringement claims against them 
from time to time  we receive correspondence asserting that our products or processes are or may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
if we believe the assertions may have merit or in other appropriate circumstances  we take steps to seek to obtain a license or to avoid the infringement 
however  we cannot predict whether a license will be available  that we would find the terms of any license offered acceptable  or that we would be able to develop an alternative solution 
failure to obtain a necessary license or develop an alternative solution could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and costs and to suspend the manufacture of affected products 
there are limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our intellectual property position is based in part on patents owned by us and patents licensed to us 
we intend to continue to file patent applications in the future  where appropriate  and to pursue such applications with us and foreign patent authorities 
however  our existing patents are subject to expiration and we cannot be sure that additional patents will be issued on any new applications around the covered technology or that our existing or future patents will not be successfully contested by third parties 
also  since issuance of a valid patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative  non infringing technology  we cannot be sure that any of our patents  or patents issued to others and licensed to us  will provide significant commercial protection  especially as new competitors enter the market 
we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others  and therefore  may adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of customer preference away from our products 
further  the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks  patents and other intellectual property rights could result in significant legal expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  even if the litigation or other action results in a determination favorable to us 
we also rely on trade secrets and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities 
we try to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy  including requiring employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached 
we also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets  or that our trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 

table of contents we may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse  which could harm our business and results of operations 
we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our intellectual property 
these attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage  or actions by hackers seeking to harm us 
we actively seek to prevent  detect and investigate any security incidents  but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects 
the theft and or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development  product development  and marketing could be reduced 
our business could be subject to significant disruption  and we could suffer monetary or other losses 
our business may be adversely affected by uncertainties in the global financial markets and our  or our customers or suppliers ability to access the capital markets 
global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained global economic recovery 
given these uncertainties  there could be future disruptions in the global economy  financial markets and consumer confidence 
if economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
for example  our customers  including our distributors and their customers  may continue to experience difficulty obtaining the financing necessary to support historical or projected purchasing patterns  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
although we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations internally  our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms in the future  or at all  may adversely affect our financial performance 
the inability to obtain adequate financing from debt or capital sources in the future could force us to self fund strategic initiatives or even forego certain opportunities  which in turn could potentially harm our performance 
we are subject to risks related to international sales and purchases 
we expect that revenue from international sales will continue to represent the majority of our total revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from sales to non us customers  with approximately of revenue from sales to customers in china 
as such  a significant slowdown in these foreign economies or lower investments in new infrastructure could have a negative impact on our sales 
we also purchase a portion of the materials included in our products from overseas sources 
our international sales and purchases are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including  without limitation  tariffs  trade barriers  regulations relating to import export control  technology transfer restrictions  the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act  the foreign corrupt practices act and the anti boycott provisions of the us export administration act 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we could be liable for administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  and in the extreme case  we could be suspended or debarred from government contracts or have our export privileges suspended  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
international sales and purchases are also subject to a variety of other risks  including risks arising from currency fluctuations  collection issues and taxes 
our international sales are subject to variability as our selling prices become less competitive in countries with currencies that are declining in value against the us dollar and more competitive in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar 
in addition  our international purchases can become more expensive if the us dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we are billed 
we have not entered into any foreign currency derivative financial instruments  however  we may choose to do so in the future in an effort to manage or hedge our foreign exchange rate risk 
we rely on a number of key sole source and limited source suppliers  and are subject to high price volatility on certain commodity inputs  variations in parts quality  and raw material consistency and availability 
we depend on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers for certain raw materials  including rare earth elements  components  services and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials and equipment used in critical stages of our manufacturing processes 
although alternative sources generally exist for these items  qualification of many of these alternative sources could take up to six months or longer 
where possible  we attempt to identify and qualify alternative sources for our sole and limited source suppliers 

table of contents we generally purchase these sole or limited source items with purchase orders  and we have limited guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
some of our sources can have variations in attributes and availability which can affect our ability to produce products in sufficient volume or quality 
we do not control the time and resources that these suppliers devote to our business  and we cannot be sure that these suppliers will perform their obligations to us 
additionally  general shortages in the marketplace of certain raw materials or key components  such as passive electrical components used in led lighting applications  may adversely impact our business 
in the past  we have experienced decreases in our production yields when suppliers have varied from previously agreed upon specifications that have impacted our cost of sales 
additionally  the inability of our suppliers to access capital efficiently could cause disruptions in their businesses  thereby negatively impacting ours 
this risk may increase if an economic downturn negatively affects key suppliers or a significant number of our other suppliers 
any delay in product delivery or other interruption or variation in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting commercial demand for our products 
if we were to lose key suppliers  our key suppliers were unable to support our demand for any reason  or we were unable to identify and qualify alternative suppliers  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted or hampered significantly 
we rely on arrangements with independent shipping companies for the delivery of our products from vendors and to customers in both the united states and abroad 
the failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security 
in our fabrication process we consume a number of precious metals and other commodities  which are subject to high price volatility 
our operating margins could be significantly affected if we are not able to pass along price increases to our customers 
in addition  production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water  silicon  electricity and gases 
future environmental regulations could restrict supply or increase the cost of certain of those materials 
changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  changes in government administrations  such as the presidency and congress of the us as well as in the states and countries in which we operate  changes in tax laws or interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including write offs of acquired in process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions  changes in available tax credits  the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions  the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock are less than those originally anticipated  and the repatriation of non us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes  or any changes in legislation that may result in these earnings being taxed within the us  regardless of our decision regarding repatriation of funds 
for example  proposals have been made by various us governmental bodies to change the us tax laws that include  among other things  limiting us tax deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modifying the us foreign tax credit rules 
although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear  it is possible that these or other changes in us tax laws could increase our us income tax liability and adversely affect our profitability 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing that the proposed changes  if enacted  would become effective 

table of contents any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods 
in addition  the determination of our income tax provision requires complex estimations  significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning the applicable tax laws 
to the extent our income tax liability materially differs from our income tax provisions and accruals due to factors  including the above  which were not anticipated at the time we estimated our tax provision  our net income or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile 
historically  our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of significant fluctuations in our revenue  earnings and margins over the past few years and variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts 
for example  the closing price per share of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market ranged from a low of in fiscal to a high of in the same fiscal year 
if our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors  our stock price will likely decline 
speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  or significant transactions can also cause changes in our stock price 
in particular  speculation around our market opportunities for energy efficient lighting may have a dramatic effect on our stock price  especially as various government agencies announce their planned investments in energy efficient technology  including lighting 
in order to compete  we must attract  motivate and retain key employees  and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 
hiring and retaining qualified executives  scientists  engineers  technical staff and sales personnel is critical to our business  and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense 
as a global company  this issue is not limited to the united states  but includes our other locations such as europe and china 
for example  there is substantial competition in china for qualified and capable personnel  particularly experienced engineers and technical personnel  which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees 
also  within huizhou  china  there are other large companies building manufacturing plants that will likely attract qualified employees 
if we are unable to staff sufficient and adequate personnel at our china facilities  we may experience lower revenues or increased manufacturing costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
to help attract  motivate and retain key employees  we use benefits such as stock based compensation awards  which include non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate  as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock  or if our share based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit  our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees could be weakened  which could harm our business and results of operations 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 
the manufacturing  assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties  fines  legal liabilities  and the forfeiture of certain tax benefits  suspension of production  alteration of our fabrication  assembly and test processes  and curtailment of our operations or sales 
in addition  our failure to manage the use  transportation  emission  discharge  storage  recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities 
existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment  modify our product designs or incur other expenses  such as permit costs  associated with such laws and regulations 
many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing  assembly and test processes or products 
any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes 
for example  under the recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in 
table of contents the us  most of our manufacturing facilities in the us may be considered major sources under the clean air act in this change could likely result in increased costs for our us operations  such as increased control and remediation requirements  additional monitoring  recordkeeping and reporting costs 
our results could vary as a result of the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies  including changes in the accounting regulations to be applied 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results see critical accounting policies and estimates in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item of this annual report 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results 
likewise  our results may be impacted due to changes in the accounting rules to be applied  such as the increased use of fair value measurement rules  proposed changes in revenue recognition requirements  and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired 
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our amortizable intangible assets or goodwill is determined to exist 
this could adversely impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio and in interest rates  and therefore  impairment of our investments or lower investment income could harm our earnings 
we are exposed to market value and inherent interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other fixed interest rate investments 
the primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal 
however  our investments are generally not fdic insured and may lose value and or become illiquid regardless of their rating

overview we are a leading innovator of lighting class leds  led lighting and semiconductor products for wireless and power applications 
our products are driving improvements in applications such as general illumination  video displays  automotive  electronic signs and signals  variable speed motors and wireless systems 

table of contents we develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and devices primarily based on sic  gan and related compounds 
the physical and electronic properties of sic and gan offer technical advantages over traditional silicon  gallium arsenide gaas  sapphire and other materials used for certain electronic applications 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from sales of our led products 
these products consist of led chips  led components  led lighting products and sic wafers 
also included in led product revenues are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of led lighting  and license fees from intellectual property rights 
as we develop and improve our led technology and the market continues to focus on energy efficiency  we believe the potential market for led lighting will continue to expand 
our success in selling led products depends upon our ability to drive adoption and offer innovative products and solutions that enable our customers to succeed in the market 
by driving adoption we believe we can influence the market and open more opportunities for leds 
in addition  we generate revenue from sales of power and rf products 
also included are revenues derived from government agencies to support the development of sic and gan based power and rf technology 
the majority of our products are manufactured at our production facilities located in north carolina and china 
we also use contract manufacturers for certain aspects of product fabrication and packaging 
we operate research and development facilities in north carolina  california  and china 
operating segments we currently operate our business as one reportable segment 
industry dynamics and trends there are a number of industry factors that affect our business which include  among others overall demand for products and applications using leds 
our potential for growth depends significantly on the adoption of leds within the general lighting market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption 
although led lighting has grown in recent years  adoption of leds for general lighting is relatively new  still limited  and faces significant challenges before widespread adoption 
demand also fluctuates based on various market cycles  a continuously evolving led industry supply chain  and demand dynamics in the market 
these uncertainties make demand difficult to forecast for us and our customers 
intense and constantly evolving competitive environment 
competition in the industry is intense and new companies have entered and are entering the led market  with many companies making significant investments in led production equipment 
product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share and to increase the utilization of their production capacity 
to remain competitive  market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs to offset lower average sales prices 
to address this pricing pressure  we have invested in the development of mm wafer production  which is intended to reduce our costs of producing led chips 
certain of our competitors also have announced the intention to produce  or have begun producing  led chips using mm wafers 
technological innovation and advancement 
innovations and advancements in led technology continue to expand the potential commercial application of leds particularly in the general illumination market 
however  new technologies or standards could emerge  or improvements could be made in existing technologies  that reduce or limit the demand for leds in certain markets 
regulatory actions concerning energy efficiency 
many countries have already instituted or have announced plans to institute government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency  even in some cases banning forms of incandescent lighting  which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds 
while this trend is generally positive  there have been some political efforts in the united states to change or limit the effectiveness of these new regulations 
intellectual property issues 
market participants rely on patented and non patented proprietary information relating to product development  manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business 
protection of intellectual property is critical 
therefore  steps such as additional patent applications  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements  as well as other security measures are 
table of contents generally taken 
to enforce or protect intellectual property rights  litigation or threatened litigation commonly occurs 
fiscal overview the following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended june  our year over year revenues increased to million 
while gross margin percentage declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  gross profit increased by million 
we achieved operating income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share was compared to for fiscal combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to  million at june  compared to  million at june  inventory increased to million at june  compared to million at june  we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity 
business outlook we project that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal we anticipate focusing on the following key areas  among others  in response to this competitive environment build on our market leadership and drive adoption of led lighting 
we are focused on developing innovative new led lighting systems to drive adoption  and new led components that enable our customers to deliver a more competitive payback versus traditional lighting 
we recognize that our leadership in lighting systems can sometimes raise questions with our component customers  but we believe this product line has helped the company set new standards in the market and disrupt the status quo in the lighting industry 
we plan to continue to invest in these product lines to increase performance  enable lower lighting system costs with shorter paybacks like our cr series downlights and troffers  and find new ways to drive the market and obsolete old  energy wasting lighting technology 
accelerate cost reductions and drive operational improvements to increase the profitability of our business 
we target lower led costs from the conversion to mm wafers  higher factory utilization  as well as yield and productivity improvements 
we plan to lower led lighting system costs with new product designs that are under development and we target improved operating leverage from higher revenues across our led lighting systems and component product lines 
expand the power and rf product line beyond niche applications 
sic power devices can deliver better performance and increased payback against silicon si based power devices in applications where efficiency is an important criteria 
we target continued investment in r d for new diode and switch products focused on more mainstream and higher volume power switching applications 
we are managing the product line through a slowdown in solar inverter demand  which we believe is a temporary market correction 
we target the combination of new products  improved market demand and expanded sales coverage to drive growth in the product line 
subsequent event on august   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with all of the shareholders of ruud lighting  inc ruud 
pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement and concurrently with the execution of the stock purchase agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of ruud in exchange for consideration consisting of  shares of our common stock and million cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
in connection with the stock purchase transaction with ruud  we paid off ruud s outstanding debt in the aggregate amount of approximately million

we recorded a loss of million on the disposal of long lived assets in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss is composed of losses due to the impairment of certain equipment due to manufacturing process changes  the impairment of capitalized patent costs and losses on the disposal of equipment 
non operating income the following table sets forth our non operating income in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to other non operating income interest income  net total we have no debt or lines of credit and we are in a net interest income position 
we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  municipal bonds  and other fixed interest rate investments 
the primary objective of our investment policy is preservation of principal 
for fiscal   and  we did not have any significant gains or losses realized from the sale of our investments 
net interest income was million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
year over year changes in interest income are due to a combination of fluctuations in interest rates on our cash and investments and differences between the periods in our average cash and investment balances 
other non operating income  net  is comprised primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses 

table of contents income tax expense the following table sets forth our income tax expense in dollars and our effective tax rate from continuing operations in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income tax expense effective tax rate on continuing operations we recorded income tax expense of million from continuing operations in fiscal as compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal is primarily due to a change in the mix of pre tax income from various tax jurisdictions  primarily mainland china and hong kong  and the new tax holiday in malaysia with respect to our subcontract manufacturing and distribution operations 
the increase in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the mix of pre tax income from various tax jurisdictions 
for further discussion of changes in our effective tax rate  please refer to note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the variation between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate of is primarily due to the consolidation of our foreign operations  which are generally subject to income taxes at lower statutory rates 
a change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on our periodic effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits that accumulate in our equity as additional paid in capital apic and referred to as the apic pool of credits 
in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards  such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock  are less than those originally anticipated  which accumulate in the apic pool  us gaap requires that we record the difference as an increase to income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources overview we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  marketable investments and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating  financing and investing needs 
we have no debt or lines of credit and have minimal lease commitments 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments  cash generated from operations and our ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  contractual obligations  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities  including potential acquisitions  divestitures or investments in complementary businesses and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
we may also access 
table of contents capital markets through the issuance of new debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities 
contractual obligations at june   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non cancelable operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through november all of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent  property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recorded as rent expense  if applicable 
purchase obligations generally relate to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials  supplies and capital equipment 
our purchase obligations represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
other long term liabilities represents liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
financial condition the following table sets forth our cash  cash equivalents and investments in thousands june  june  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our liquidity and capital resources depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital 
our working capital increased to  million as of june  from  million at june   primarily due to an increase in inventory 
the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle june  june  change days of sales outstanding a days of supply in inventory b days in accounts payable c cash conversion cycle 
table of contents a days of sales outstanding dso calculates the average collection period of our receivables 
dso is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue for the quarter then ended 
dso is calculated by adding ending accounts receivable  net of applicable allowances and reserves  and dividing that sum by the average net revenue per day for the respective quarter 
b days of supply in inventory dsi measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product 
dsi is based on ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dsi is calculated by dividing inventory by average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
c days in accounts payable dpo calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment 
dpo is based on ending accounts payable and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dpo is calculated by dividing accounts payable by the average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
overall our cash conversion cycle  or days to cash  increased primarily due to an increase in inventory on hand 
the increase in inventory is primarily related to our building product in response to a higher demand forecast than our actual results 
as of june   substantially all of our investments had investment grade ratings  and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at june  were in such position due to interest rate changes  sector credit rating changes or company specific rating changes 
as we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value  we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities 
when evaluating our investments for possible impairment  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis  the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
the declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  we do not believe these securities are impaired as of june  we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for fiscal we have and may continue to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents  or funds underlying our marketable securities  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
with our strong working capital position  we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and  when necessary or appropriate  make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio  secure key intellectual properties  or expand our production capacity 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange changes net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was relatively unchanged year over year  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher year over year net income  offset in part due to larger receivable and inventory balances to support higher sales volumes 
cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our investments  strategic acquisitions  purchase of property  plant and equipment and purchase of patent and license rights 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this year over year decrease was primarily the result of an overall net decrease in short term investment purchase activity and payment of contingent consideration related to our cotco acquisition 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our current year capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment to expand our global production capacity and proceeds from maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this year over year increase was primarily due to an increase in cash available for investments as a result of the issuance and sale of million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million and a year over year increase in the amount of cash received from employee stock option exercises 
in addition  we increased capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of our anticipated growth 
we will continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures  while making strategic investments to develop our existing products  pursue strategic initiatives where appropriate and invest in our manufacturing and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
we target committing capital of approximately million in fiscal for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this year over year decrease was primarily related to our sale of million shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering during fiscal  with net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this year over year increase was primarily due to the issuance and sale of million shares of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million and a year over year increase in the amount of cash received from employee stock option exercises 
as of june   up to million of our common stock remained approved for repurchase under the repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
at the discretion of our management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party  whereas  unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third 
table of contents party would use in pricing an asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that we are able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the financial assets for which we perform recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents and short term investments 
the financial assets for which we may be required to perform non recurring fair value remeasurements eg  an impairment of assets are any investments in privately held companies 
as of june   financial assets utilizing level inputs included money market funds 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included corporate bonds  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  variable rate demand notes  non us government securities  commercial paper  and us agency securities 
level assets are valued using a third party pricing services consensus price which is a weighted average price based on multiple sources 
these sources determine prices utilizing market income models which factor in  where applicable  transactions of similar assets in active markets  transactions of identical assets in infrequent markets  interest rates  bond or credit default swap spreads and volatility 
we do not have any significant financial assets requiring the use of level inputs 
please refer to note  fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further information 
financial and market risks we are exposed to financial and market risks  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodities risk 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks  however  we may choose to do so in the future 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at june  and june  actual results may differ materially 
interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
in order to minimize risk  our cash management policy permits us to acquire investments rated aa grade or better 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market price of our investments was approximately million at june  and million at june  currency exchange rates as we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities 
our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi cny 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar compared to the chinese renminbi was approximately million at june  and million at june  
table of contents commodities we utilize significant amounts of precious metals  gasses and other commodities in our manufacturing processes 
general economic conditions  market specific changes or other factors outside of our control may affect the pricing of these commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our us and international facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of june  are detailed above in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in the application of us gaap we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  tax related contingencies  valuation of inventories  contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  including expected trends  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with us gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require a high degree of management judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates  each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by persuasive evidence of an arrangement  typically in the form of a purchase order  when the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of revenue 
table of contents is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
for the year ended june   of our product sales were made to distributors 
distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base  which may include value added resellers  manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods  or ultimate end users of our products 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our distributors 
this arrangement is often referred to as a sell in or point of purchase model as opposed to a sell through or point of sale model  where revenue is deferred and not recognized until the distributor sells the product through to their customer 
our distributors may be provided limited rights that allow them to return a portion of inventory product exchange rights or stock rotation rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices price protection rights or other targeted sales incentives 
when determining our net revenue  we make significant judgments and estimates corresponding with product shipments 
we record a reserve for estimated future returns  changes in selling prices  and other targeted sales incentives when product ships 
we also record an asset for the estimated value of product returns that we believe will be returned to inventory in the future and resold  and these estimates are based upon historical data  current economic trends  distributor inventory levels and other related factors 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent upon our ability to make reliable estimates 
actual results may vary and could have a significant impact on our operating results 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand 
we also analyze sales levels by product type  including historical and estimated future customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate 
for example  we adjust for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product 
any adjustment to our inventory as a result of an estimated obsolescence or net realizable condition is reflected as a component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory  we determine normal capacity for our manufacturing facilities based on historical patterns 
if our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate  or market conditions or technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to take excess capacity charges in accordance with us gaap  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
when we establish or increase a valuation allowance  our income tax expense increases in the period such determination is made 
if we decrease a valuation allowance  our income tax expense decreases in the period such a determination is made 
tax contingencies we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
the audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc  we evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
asc states that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where it is not more likely than not likelihood of greater than for being sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to other liabilities to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for awards of stock based compensation under our employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method 
accordingly  we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currently use the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the inherent limitations of option valuation models available today  including future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock based awards  the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements 
for restricted stock awards  grant date fair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
this fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
we estimate expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of future activity 
the assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized  only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions  we may be required to adjust compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
recoverability of long lived assets 
table of contents our assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets involves significant judgment and estimation 
these assessments reflect our assumptions  which  we believe  are consistent with the assumptions hypothetical marketplace participants use 
factors that we must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volumes  prices  cost of capital  tax rates  and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
we evaluate long lived assets such as property  equipment and definite lived intangible assets  such as patents  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recorded in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider include whether there has been a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the way an asset is being used  or a significant change  delay or departure in our strategy for that asset 
if impairment is indicated we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets 
if so  an impairment loss is measured and recorded 
after an impairment loss is recognized  a new  lower cost basis for that long lived asset is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss 
our impairment loss calculations require that we apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including estimating useful lives of the assets 
to make these judgments  we may use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be required to record additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
the second step is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
however  it should be noted that the loss recognized shall not be in excess of the carrying amount 
once a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying value shall be its new accounting basis 

table of contents contingent liabilities we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with us gaap 
in accordance with us gaap  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final 
table of contents outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
as additional information becomes available  we reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position
