the company also manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services for customers who produce electronic systems for communications  consumer and military applications 
to enhance the readers understanding of the company performance  the following chronological overview of the company results for the years through have been provided 
in the first quarter of  bookings levels rebounded from the fourth quarter of  resulting in the highest quarterly booking level since the first quarter of and a book to bill ratio significantly above one 
first quarter revenues of million increased sequentially compared to fourth quarter revenues of million 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to stronger demand from the wire line communications  digital television  industrial and voice over ip end markets  which offset seasonal declines in sales to the computing and wireless handset end markets 
revenues through micrel s sell through distributors increased in the first quarter of and the number of weeks of distribution channel inventory decreased slightly on a sequential basis 
gross margin improved to in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of while at the same time inventory levels were reduced 
first quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of increased to per share from per share reported in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in its first proxy contest since going public in  with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this proxy contest resulted in micrel incurring incremental operating expenses of  in the first quarter  million in the second quarter   in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of see management discussions and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations proxy contest expense for additional information 
in the second quarter of  total bookings remained firm  resulting in a book to bill ratio above one 
second quarter bookings were paced by demand from customers serving the communications  industrial  and wireless handset end markets 
customers remained very cautious  which continued to keep order lead times in the four to five week range 
in the second quarter of  micrel posted its highest sequential revenue growth rate in four years 
second quarter revenues of million increased by million  or  from the first quarter of the growth in revenues was led by stronger demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wireless handset  and wi fi voice over ip end markets  combined with record sales through the company s global sell through distributors 
gross margin was  which was similar to gross margin in the first quarter of second quarter operating profit was million  or of sales 
a total of million of proxy contest expenses reduced micrel s operating income by approximately in the second quarter of  and also had the effect of reducing operating margin by approximately in the second quarter of second quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
expenses related to the company s proxy contest reduced net income by per share in the second quarter of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial markets in the united states  europe and asia experienced extreme disruption in the second half of  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
in the third quarter of  concerns related to the deterioration in the global financial and credit markets  including with respect to the availability and cost of credit  contributed to instability in worldwide capital and credit markets and diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of  and combined with uncertainty about the global economy in general  contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and a further economic slowdown 
although governments took unprecedented actions in an attempt to alleviate the credit crisis  customers and consumers began to cut back on spending in order to conserve cash in the third quarter of this resulted in the slowing of orders from micrel s distributors and direct oem customers  which continued into the fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  total bookings were less than revenues  resulting in a book to bill ratio of less than one 
notwithstanding the order decrease  resales of the company s products from global sell through distributors remained strong throughout the quarter and were at the highest levels ever experienced by the company 
in the third quarter of  micrel posted million in revenue  a decrease of from the second quarter of the sequential quarter decrease in sales primarily resulted from reduced demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wi fi voice over ip and foundry sales to a major solar end customer 
this was offset by slight increases in the computer and consumer markets 
third quarter gross margin was  down from in the second quarter of operating income was million  or of sales 
this compares to operating income of million in the second quarter of other income  net was unchanged quarter to quarter at  the effective tax rate was for the third quarter 
third quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
fourth quarter revenue of million decreased by million  or  from million in the third quarter of the decrease in revenues was due to tight year end inventory control in most geographies  channels and end markets as a result of the worldwide financial crisis 
the worldwide macroeconomic recession in the fourth quarter caused the company s customers to focus on maintaining lean inventories 
the company s global distributors and a number of major oem customers took action to minimize inventories at year end 
as a consequence  customer orders and purchases declined in november and december after strong activity in october 
for the fourth quarter  micrel s overall book to bill ratio was below one 
fourth quarter gross margin was  compared to in the third quarter of the decrease in gross margin was the result of factory underutilization and additional inventory reserves due to a lower sales forecast 
fourth quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   micrel s financial performance continued to be strong  especially in light of the existing economic conditions 
total revenues of million were up slightly  compared with million in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in net income included a million pre tax gain associated with a first quarter legal settlement  which after income taxes  is equivalent to per diluted share 
gross margins for were compared to in solid cash flows from operations of million during the year enabled the repurchase of million shares of common stock  or approximately of the shares outstanding at the beginning of in addition  during the year ended december   the company paid cash dividends of million

revenues in the fourth quarter of increased to million  as compared to million in the third quarter of the sequential growth was driven by increasing demand across most major markets for the company s products 
during the fourth quarter of  the book to bill ratio was significantly greater than one 
fourth quarter gross margin increased to  from in the third quarter of the improvement in gross margin was in part due to better capacity utilization as a result of increased revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
during the quarter  total operating expenses included a million non cash  pre tax charge related to the impairment of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment located at the company s san jose fabrication facility 
operating income in the fourth quarter of was million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the third quarter net income in the fourth quarter of was million  or per basic and diluted share  which included a per diluted share reduction due to equipment impairment

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the third quarter of  revenues increased to million  representing an increase of million  or  from million in the second quarter of  marking the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the company 
the increase in revenues as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to improved demand in the industrial and communications end markets 
compared to the same period last year  revenues increased by million  or  due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company geographies and end markets 
bookings for the third quarter of declined from second quarter levels  primarily due to reduced orders from distributors as they adjusted inventories to be in line with reduced order lead times 
the company s book to bill ratio for the third quarter of was less than one 
third quarter gross margin was  as compared to in the prior quarter

during the fourth quarter of  revenues decreased to million from million in the third quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  revenues increased by million  or  due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company geographies and end markets 
customer demand moderated in the fourth quarter of as the semiconductor industry completed its recovery from the downturn of fourth quarter bookings seasonally declined from the third quarter levels  resulting in a book to bill ratio below one for the quarter 
the company s book to bill remained above one for the full year consistent with bookings being unusually high due to long lead times in the first half of the year followed by softer demand and shorter more normal lead times in the second half 
fourth quarter gross margin was  as compared to in the third quarter of this decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of reduced factory utilization combined with a greater mix of direct sales to customers serving consumer markets  which tend to carry lower gross margins 
net income for the fourth quarter of was million  or per basic and diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of  and net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fourth quarter of net income for the fourth quarter of  which included a million non cash  pre tax charge related to the impairment of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company geographies and end markets  which resulted from improved macro economic conditions  an expanded sales force  solid operational execution and increased shipments of new products 
gross margin for increased to  from for this increase was primarily due to improved factory utilization and  to a lesser extent  a reduced sales mix of lower margin products shipped to the wireless handset market as compared to operating margin for was which represents the highest level in a decade 
net income increased over in to million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in the diluted earnings per share of was an all time annual record for micrel and surpassed its previous record of  which was achieved in when total revenues were higher than revenues in the increase in diluted earnings per share was due in part to a decrease in the number of diluted shares in  as compared to  as a result of the company s share repurchase program

in addition  in the company repurchased million of its common stock  and paid million in dividends to shareholders 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development and customer acceptance of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in part i item a of this annual report on form k 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  including global economic conditions  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company significant accounting policies  see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to oems  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company allows certain distributors located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue and related cost of sales are not recognized  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales to oem customers and stocking representatives are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
share based compensation 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the company estimates expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
the company uses a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
during recent years  the company has resolved litigation involving intellectual property claims 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative equipment impairment and restructuring charges credits proxy contest expense credits total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for other products revenues  which consist primarily of custom and foundry product revenues  increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for these increases were due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company geographies and end markets  which resulted from improved macro economic conditions  an expanded sales force  solid operational execution and increased shipments of new products 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   net revenues decreased to million compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for other products revenues which consist primarily of custom and foundry product revenues  decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for these decreases were the result of decreased unit shipments across all product lines and geographies due to a reduction in demand caused by the worldwide macroeconomic recession 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
historically  the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders for products to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry  orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenues  it can be very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
the resulting lack of visibility into demand also makes it difficult to match product build with future demand as the company lead times to build its products may be substantially longer than order lead times 
as noted in 
item a risk factors and above in the overview section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a trend has developed over the last several years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
international sales represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to customers in asia represented of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  and of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has resulted in increased pricing pressure for the company and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves in any manner other than by lowering prices 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for this increase was primarily due to improved factory utilization and  to a lesser extent  a reduced sales mix of lower margin products shipped to the wireless handset market as compared to 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   the company gross margin decreased to from for this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from decreased manufacturing capacity utilization and decreased average selling prices in as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented for the year ended december  compared to for on a dollar basis  research and development expenses were relatively flat at million for the year ended compared to million for the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased million or to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels and decreased prototype fabrication costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented for the year ended december  as compared to for on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily due to increased sales headcount  increased sales commissions and increased bonus compensation accruals 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million from million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels  decreased commission expenses  decreased advertising expenses and decreased profit sharing accruals 
proxy contest expense credits 
during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in a proxy contest with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental expenses of million during these expenses consisted primarily of outside consulting and legal fees 
subsequent to a special meeting of shareholders on may   at which the company s shareholders rejected all proposals set forth by ocm  ocm agreed to withdraw its slate of nominees for the board of directors  and support micrel s board nominees at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders 
micrel s slate of directors was subsequently elected by shareholders at the company s annual meeting on october  during the fourth quarter of  the company negotiated a reduction in outside service fees related to the proxy contest and recorded a  credit 
equipment impairment and restructuring charges credits 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of certain excess semiconductor manufacturing equipment which was removed from service and was held for sale as of december  the million net book value of the equipment held for sale was reduced to its estimated sales value of  due to increased manufacturing output requirements which resulted from increased product demand in  this equipment was placed back in service at  as of december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued share based compensation 
share based compensation costs for stock option grants are based on the fair value calculated from a stock option pricing model on the date of grant 
the company results of operations for the years ended december   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
during  micrel recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which  is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense

other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term and long term investment securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million  or of income before taxes  as compared to of income before taxes for and of income before taxes for the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of non deductible share based compensation expense  state income taxes  federal and state research and development credits and federal qualified production activity deductions 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of million plus non cash activities of million consisting primarily of million in depreciation and amortization and million in share based compensation  offset in part by million in deferred income taxes combined with a million increase in deferred income  a million increase in accrued compensation and a million increase in accounts payable  which were offset in part by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories  a million increase in income taxes receivable and a million increase in prepaid and other assets 
for the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities
