item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
you should understand  however  that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the factors that are noted to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to update or revise publicly any of our forward looking statements  including forward looking statements in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with or furnished to the sec 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following statements describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business  prospects  financial condition  operating results or credit ratings  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the risks described below are not the only risks we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or risks that we currently consider immaterial  could also negatively affect our business  our results and operations 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results which could cause our financial results to be below expectations and cause our stock price to be volatile 
we have historically experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  and may result in volatility of our stock price 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand or lack of demand for our products  including demand that adversely affects our ability to optimize the use of our manufacturing facilities  the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours  including generic competition  developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products  regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations with respect to our products  regulatory approvals for our and our competitor s manufacturing facilities  timing and levels of spending for research and development  sales and marketing  timing and levels of reimbursement from third party payers for our products  development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets  the acquisition of new products and companies  tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate  timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees  ability to control our costs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and economic and market instability 
we are dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products revlimid  vidaza  thalomid and abraxane and a significant decline in demand for or use of these products or our other commercially available products could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
during the next several years  the growth of our business will be largely dependent on the commercial success of revlimid  vidaza  thalomid  and abraxane 
we cannot predict whether these or our other existing or new products will be accepted by regulators  physicians  patients and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with certain advantages over existing or future therapies 
we are continuing to introduce our products in additional international markets and to obtain approvals for additional indications both in the united states and internationally 
a delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals for these markets or indications could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our stock 
further  if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of our products  physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined  the commercial success of such products could be adversely affected and the acceptance of our other products could be negatively impacted 
we are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that require us to report to the fda or similar bodies in other countries if our products are associated with a death or serious injury 
these adverse events  among others  could result in additional regulatory controls  such as the performance of costly post approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved 
table of contents labeling  which could limit the indications or patient population for our products or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market 
similarly  the occurrence of serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the products could negatively impact product sales 
for example  thalomid is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the baby 
revlimid is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against use of vidaza in pregnant women as well 
while we have restricted distribution systems for both thalomid and revlimid and we endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential known adverse events including pregnancy risks  we cannot ensure that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from non compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
it is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain market acceptance as well as our other products including istodax  focalin xr and the ritalin family of drugs 
a number of factors may adversely impact the degree of market acceptance of our products  including the products efficacy  safety and advantages  if any  over competing products  as well as the reimbursement policies of third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans  patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects 
if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we will be unable to sell our current products and products in development 
changes in law  government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the discovery  preclinical development  clinical trials  manufacturing  risk evaluation and mitigation strategies such as our steps and revassist programs  marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive laws and regulations  including  without limitation  the us federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the us public health service act  medicare modernization act  food and drug administration amendments act  the us foreign corrupt practices act  the sherman antitrust act  patent laws  environmental laws  privacy laws and other federal and state statutes  including anti kickback  antitrust and false claims laws  as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions 
enforcement of and changes in laws  government regulations or policies can have a significant adverse impact on our ability to continue to commercialize our products or introduce new products to the market  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
if we or our agents  contractors or collaborators are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain all  necessary governmental approvals  we will be unable to effectively market our products 
the testing  marketing and manufacturing of our products requires regulatory approval  including approval from the fda and  in some cases  from the environmental protection agency  or epa  or governmental authorities outside of the united states that perform roles similar to those of the fda and epa  including the ema  ec  the swissmedic  the australian therapeutic goods administration and health canada 
certain of our pharmaceutical products  such as focalin  fall under the controlled substances act of that requires authorization by the us drug enforcement agency  or dea  of the us department of justice in order to handle and distribute these products 
the regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to us  principally in general  preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years  and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval  delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  a regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality or  in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication  because another designee received approval first or receives approval of other labeled indications  requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations or legislation  
table of contents the scope of any regulatory approval  when obtained  may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings  precautions and contra indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the drug  approved products  as well as their manufacturers  are subject to continuing and ongoing review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture  sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market  regulatory authorities and agencies of the united states or foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products  including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non governmental organizations can reduce the use of our products  once a product receives marketing approval  we may not market that product for broader or different applications  and the fda may not grant us approval with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology 
in addition  the fda may withdraw or modify existing approvals in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products 
the fda may also request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our existing or proposed products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  products  such as revlimid  that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an expedited withdrawal if the post marketing study commitments are not completed with due diligence  the post marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug  or evidence demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its conditions of use 
additionally  promotional materials for such products are subject to enhanced surveillance  including pre approval review of all promotional materials used within days following marketing approval and a requirement for the submissions days prior to initial dissemination of all promotional materials disseminated after days following marketing approval  and our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  labeling and promotional activities relating to our products as well as our post marketing activities are regulated by the fda  the federal trade commission  the united states department of justice  the dea  state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies and are subject to associated risks 
in addition  individual states  acting through their attorneys general  have become active as well  seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 
if we fail to comply with regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products  appropriate distribution of our products under our restricted distribution systems  prohibition on off label promotion and the promotion of unapproved products  such agencies may bring enforcement actions against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities as well as result in significant penalties 
other matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely affect our business include changes in laws and regulations  including without limitation  patent  environmental  privacy  health care and competition laws  importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries  additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals  and privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data from foreign jurisdictions 
we collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses 
the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research currently regulates human tissue or cells intended for transplantation  implantation  infusion or transfer to a human recipient under cfr parts and 
table of contents part requires cell and tissue establishments to screen and test donors  to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to register the establishment with fda 
this part also provides for inspection by the fda of cell and tissue establishments 
the fda recently announced that as of october   a bla will be required to distribute cord blood for unrelated allogeneic use 
currently  we are required to be  and are  licensed to operate in new york  new jersey  maryland and california 
if other states adopt similar licensing requirements  we would need to obtain such licenses to continue operating our stem cell banking businesses 
if we are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain at all  necessary licenses  we will be unable to provide services in those states and this could impact negatively on our revenues 
sales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products by governmental and other third party payers is reduced or terminated 
sales of our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance  managed care  pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations  or reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other third party payers 
generally  in europe and other countries outside the united states  the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients 
these health care management organizations and third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
additionally  the newly enacted health care reform act has provided sweeping health care reform  which may impact the prices of drugs 
in addition to the newly enacted federal legislation  state legislatures and foreign governments have also shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs  including price controls  restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products 
the establishment of limitations on patient access to our drugs  adoption of price controls and cost containment measures in new jurisdictions or programs  and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures  including the impact of the health care reform act  could adversely impact our business and future results 
if these organizations and third party payers do not consider our products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies  they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our products or  if they do  the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis 
our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the united states depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations  or gpos 
many existing and potential customers for our products become members of gpos 
gpos negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts  sometimes on an exclusive basis  with medical supply manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members 
if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo  affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products  and if the gpo has negotiated a strict sole source  market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer s products  we may be precluded from making sales to members of the gpo for the duration of the contractual arrangement 
our failure to renew contracts with gpos may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms 
if we are unable to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with gpos  our competitive position may suffer 
we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the united states 
international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations  and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products 
although we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future cost containment measures or other potential legislative or regulatory developments  additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our long term success depends  in part  on intellectual property protection 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  can be uncertain 
table of contents and involve complex legal and factual questions including those related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies such as our steps and revassist programs 
in addition  the coverage sought in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications  which have not already been allowed  will result in the issuance of patents or  if any patents are issued  whether they will be dominated by third party patent rights  whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they will be circumvented  opposed  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or infringed by others 
further  we are aware of third party us patents that relate to  for example  the use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot be assured as to any impact to our potential products  or guarantee that our patents or pending applications will not be involved in  or be defeated as a result of  opposition proceedings before a foreign patent office or any interference proceedings before the united states patent trademark office  or pto 
with respect to patents and patent applications we have licensed in  there can be no assurance that additional patents will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have licensed patent rights  or that  if any new patents are issued  such patents will not be opposed  challenged  invalidated  infringed or dominated or provide us with significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial advantage 
nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will not be either infringed  invalidated or circumvented by others  or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated 
any termination of the licenses granted to us by cmcc could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because patent applications filed in the united states on or before november  are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  patent applications filed in the united states on or after november  are not published until approximately months after their earliest claimed priority date  united states patent applications that are not filed outside the united states may not publish at all until issued  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we  or our licensors  were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the issued patents or pending patent applications or that we  or our licensors  were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
in the event a third party has also filed a patent for any of our inventions  we  or our licensors  may have to participate in interference proceedings before the pto to determine priority of invention  which could result in the loss of a us patent or loss of any opportunity to secure us patent protection for the invention 
even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us  such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such patents 
however  we do not know whether such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents  to assert patent infringement claims against others and to defend against patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that  in the event that claims of any of our owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third parties  any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable 
an adverse outcome in such litigation could cause us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
if a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us  we could be forced to cease using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights  be subject to significant liabilities to such third party and or be required to license technologies from such third party 
also  different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents  and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity  enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country 
competitors have chosen and in the future may choose to file oppositions to patent applications  which have been deemed allowable by foreign patent examiners 
furthermore  even if our owned or licensed patents are determined to be valid and enforceable  there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
additionally  for these same reasons  we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and thereby create freedom to 
table of contents operate issues 
if this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such technology  which is dominated by others patent rights  or alternatively  seek a license to practice our own invention  whether or not patented 
we also rely upon unpatented  proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors 
there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  despite precautions taken by us  others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology or that such technology will not be found to be non proprietary or not a trade secret 
our products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow on products and providers of these products may be able to sell them at a substantially lower cost than us 
generic drug manufacturers are seeking to compete with our drugs  and present an important challenge to us 
even if our patent applications  or those we have licensed in  are issued  innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors may challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of such patents in court  requiring us to engage in complex  lengthy and costly litigation 
alternatively  innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors may be able to design around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
if any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed or challenged  we may not be successful in enforcing or defending our or our licensor s intellectual property rights and subsequently may not be able to develop or market the applicable product exclusively 
upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products  or upon the at risk launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products  we can quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product  which can adversely affect our business 
in addition  if generic versions of our competitors branded products lose their market exclusivity  our patented products may face increased competition which can adversely affect our business 
the fda approval process allows for the approval of an anda or b application for a generic version of our approved products upon the expiration  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  of relevant patent or non patent exclusivity protection 
generic manufacturers pursuing anda approvals are not required to conduct costly and time consuming clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their products  rather  they are permitted to rely on the innovator s data regarding safety and efficacy 
thus  generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies who have incurred substantial expenses associated with the research and development of the drug product 
accordingly  while our products currently may retain certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity  our products are or will be subject to anda applications to the fda in light of the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the anda procedure includes provisions allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the innovator s patent protection prior to the generic manufacturer actually commercializing their products the so called paragraph iv certification procedure 
in recent years  generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge the applicability of orange book listed patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals  and we expect this trend to continue and to implicate drug products with even relatively modest revenues 
during the exclusivity periods  the fda is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an anda 
upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  the fda may grant effective approval of an anda for a generic drug  or may accept reference to a previously protected nda in a b application 
further  upon such expiration event  the fda may require a generic competitor to participate in some form of risk management system which could include our participation as well 
depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities  any such approval could be limited to certain formulations and or indications claims  ie  those not covered by any outstanding exclusivities 
if an anda filer or a generic manufacturer were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow on version of one of our products  that product would become subject to increased competition and our revenues for that product would be adversely affected 

table of contents we have received a paragraph iv certification letter dated august   advising us that natco pharma limited of hyderabad  india  or natco  submitted an anda to the fda 
see part  item  legal proceedings revlimid of this report for further discussion 
if we are not able to effectively compete our business will be adversely affected 
the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms  including  but not limited to takeda and johnson johnson  which compete with revlimid and thalomid in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with our compounds  eisai co  ltd  supergen  inc and johnson johnson  which compete or may potentially compete with vidaza  in addition eisai co  ltd 
potentially competes with abraxane  and in other oncology products in general  amgen  which potentially competes with our tnf and kinase inhibitors  astrazeneca plc  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our compounds and tnf inhibitors  biogen idec inc and genzyme corporation  both of which are generally developing drugs that address the oncology and immunology markets  bristol myers squibb co  which potentially competes with abraxane  and in clinical trials with our compounds and tnf inhibitors  in addition to other oncology products in general  f 
hoffman la roche ltd  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our imids compounds and tnf inhibitors  in addition to other oncology products in general  johnson johnson  which potentially competes with certain of our proprietary programs  including our oral anti inflammatory programs  abbott laboratories  which potentially competes with our oral anti inflammatory programs  novartis  which potentially competes with our compounds and kinase programs  pfizer  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors  and sanofi aventis  which competes with abraxane  in addition to other oncology products in general 
many of these companies have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this enables them  among other things  to make greater research and development investments and spread their research and development costs  as well as their marketing and promotion costs  over a broader revenue base 
our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the fda  and other regulatory authorities 
we also experience competition from universities and other research institutions  and in some instances  we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources 
the pharmaceutical industry has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change  and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
the development of products  including generics  or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline 
we may be required to modify our business practices  pay fines and significant expenses or experience losses due to litigation or governmental investigations 
from time to time  we may be subject to litigation or governmental investigation on a variety of matters  including  without limitation  regulatory  intellectual property  product liability  antitrust  consumer  whistleblower  commercial  securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business as currently conducted or as conducted in the future 

table of contents in particular  we are subject to significant product liability risks as a result of the testing of our products in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval 
pharmaceutical companies involved in hatch waxman litigation are often subject to follow on lawsuits and governmental investigations  which may be costly and could result in lower priced generic products that are competitive with our products being introduced to the market 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a civil investigative demand cid from the us federal trade commission  or the ftc 
the ftc requested documents and other information relating to requests by generic companies to purchase our patented revlimid and thalomid brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in unfair methods of competition 
in the first quarter of  the state of connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in the cid and issued a subpoena 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a second cid from the ftc relating to this matter 
we continue to respond to requests for information 
in the first quarter of  we received a letter from the united states attorney for the central district of california informing us that we were under investigation relating to our promotion of the drugs thalomid and revlimid regarding off label marketing and improper payments to physicians 
we are cooperating with the unites states attorney in connection with this investigation 
on january   the supreme court of canada ruled that the jurisdiction of the patented medicine prices review board  or the pmprb  extends to sales of drugs to canadian patients even if the locus of sale is within the united states 
this means that our us sales of thalomid brand drug to canadian patients under the special access program are subject to pmprb jurisdiction from and after january  in accordance with the ruling of the supreme court of canada  we have provided to date data regarding these special access program sales to the pmprb 
in light of the approval of thalomid brand drug for multiple myeloma by health canada on august   this drug is now sold through our canadian entity and is no longer sold to canadian patients in the united states 
the pmprb s proposed pricing arrangement has not been determined 
depending on the calculation  we may be requested to return certain revenues associated with these sales and to pay fines 
should this occur  we would have to consider various legal options to address whether the pricing determination was reasonable 
litigation and governmental investigations are inherently unpredictable and may result in rulings that are materially unfavorable to us  including claims for significant damages  fines or penalties  and administrative remedies  such as exclusion and or debarment from government programs  or other rulings that prevent us from operating our business in a certain manner  cause us to change our business operations to avoid perceived risks associated with such litigation or investigations  have an adverse affect on our reputation and the demand for our products  and require the expenditure of significant time and resources  which may divert the attention of our management and interfere with the pursuit of our strategic objectives 
while we maintain insurance for certain risks  the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities 
it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all potential risks and liabilities 
if any litigation or governmental investigation were to have a material adverse result  there could be a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
see also legal proceedings contained in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
the development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process  and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently developing 
many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources  extensive research  development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
this process involves a high degree of risk and takes many years 
our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many 
table of contents reasons  including the failure of the product candidate in preclinical studies  adverse patient reactions to the product candidate or indications or other safety concerns  insufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate  our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost efficient manner  our failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate  the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product candidate  or changes in the regulatory environment  including pricing and reimbursement  that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer desirable 
moreover  our commercially available products may require additional studies with respect to approved indications as well as new indications pending approval 
the stem cell products that we are developing through our cct subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional products and therapies which are now  or may be in the future  manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
furthermore  public attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe  and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical studies  we can give no assurances that our studies will have a positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for our new products or new indications 
manufacturing and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our manufacturing sites would significantly interrupt our production capabilities  which could result in significant product delays and adversely affect our results 
we have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third party manufacturers and distributors to provide api  encapsulation  finishing services packaging and distribution services to meet our needs 
these risks include the possibility that our or our suppliers manufacturing processes could be partially or completely disrupted by a fire  natural disaster  terrorist attack  governmental action or military action 
in the case of a disruption  we may need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for these products 
this would likely lead to substantial production delays as we build or locate replacement facilities and seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
if this occurs  and our finished goods inventories are insufficient to meet demand  we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis  if at all 
further  our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur and we would have to bear the additional cost of any disruption 
for these reasons  a significant disruptive event at certain of our manufacturing facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  if we fail to predict market demand for our products  we may be unable to sufficiently increase production capacity to satisfy demand or may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we manufacture 
in all the countries where we sell our products  governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution and storing 
all of our suppliers of raw materials  contract manufacturers and distributors must comply with these regulations as applicable 
in the united states  the fda requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations and guidelines 
our failure to comply  or failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  disgorgement  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products 
in addition  before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped  it must conform to release specifications pre approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product 
if the operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason  any required fda review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products 
if our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness  or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  our ability to continue supplying such products at a level that meets demand could be adversely affected 

table of contents we have contracted with specialty distributors  to distribute revlimid  thalomid  vidaza  abraxane and istodax in the united states 
if our distributors fail to perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time  we may experience adverse effects to our business and results of operations 
we are continuing to establish marketing and distribution capabilities in international markets with respect to our products 
at the same time  we are in the process of obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain countries 
if we have not successfully completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our receipt of such approvals  our ability to effectively launch our products in these countries would be severely restricted 
the consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us 
we sell our pharmaceutical products in the united states primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted pharmacies 
these wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the united states 
this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation 
as a result  a smaller number of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a significant share of the market 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us 
in addition  wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee for service arrangements  and their purchases may exceed customer demand  resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters 
we cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying 
risks from the improper conduct of employees  agents or contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation 
we cannot ensure that our compliance controls  policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees  agents  contractors or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including without limitation  employment  foreign corrupt practices  environmental  competition and privacy laws 
such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations  monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business  results of operations and reputation 
the integration of abraxis and other acquired businesses may present significant challenges to us 
we may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we acquire  such as abraxis  and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions 
achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of abraxis will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
our integration of abraxis involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations  higher integration costs than anticipated  failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees  difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices  as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations  and difficulties in the integration of departments  systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records  and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards  controls  including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes oxley act of and related procedures and policies 

table of contents if we cannot successfully integrate abraxis we may experience material negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
successful integration of abraxis will depend on our ability to manage these operations  to realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and  to some degree  to eliminate redundant and excess costs 
because of difficulties in combining geographically distant operations  we may not be able to achieve the benefits that we hope to achieve as a result of the acquisition with abraxis 
our inability to continue to attract and retain key leadership  managerial  commercial and scientific talent could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends  in large part  on our continued ability to i attract and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and commercial personnel  ii successfully integrate large numbers of new employees into our corporate culture and iii develop and maintain important relationships with leading research and medical institutions and key distributors 
competition for these types of personnel and relationships is intense 
among other benefits  we use share based compensation to attract and retain personnel 
share based compensation accounting rules require us to recognize all share based compensation costs as expenses 
these or other factors could reduce the number of shares and options management and our board of directors grants under our incentive plan 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key relationships  or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase 
we could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks associated with using hazardous materials in our business 
we use certain hazardous materials in our research  development  manufacturing and general business activities 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials  we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur 
if an accident or environmental discharge occurs  or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations  including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire  we could be liable for cleanup obligations  damages and fines 
this could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources 
additionally  the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future  requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage 
changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  the accounting for stock options and other share based compensation  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  changes in accounting standards  changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  the outcome of examinations by the us internal revenue service and other jurisdictions  the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets  and changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings 
the impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have an impact on our results of operations 
currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 
we collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 

table of contents we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk  but not to engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the use of these derivative instruments mitigates the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost but may not fully offset any change in operating results that result from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations 
as we continue to expand at a rapid pace  the development of new and or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority 
during this expansion period  our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting 
such misstatements may result in litigation and or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock 
the decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations 
sales of our products are dependent  in large part  on reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers  distribution partners and other organizations 
as a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions  these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
in addition  us federal and state health authorities may reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements  and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales  revenue and cash flows 
due to tightened global credit  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business  including portions of our product manufacturing  royalty revenue  clinical development of future collaboration products  conduct of clinical trials and raw materials 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business could be adversely affected 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you may lose some or all of your investment in us 
the market for our shares of common stock may be subject to disruptions that could cause volatility in its price 
in general  current global economic conditions have caused substantial market volatility and instability 
any such disruptions or continuing volatility may adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition to current global economic instability in general  the following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products  fluctuations in our commercial and operating results  announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors  market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular  stock market conditions generally  changes in governmental regulations and laws  including  without limitation  changes in tax laws  health care legislation  environmental laws  competition laws  and patent laws  new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings  public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting  
table of contents patent or proprietary rights developments  changes in pricing and third party reimbursement policies for our products  the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes related to production and formulation of those products or uses of those products  other litigation or governmental investigations  competition  and investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions 
in addition  our operations may be materially affected by conditions in the global markets and economic conditions throughout the world  including the current global economic and market instability 
the global market and economic climate may continue to deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control  including continued economic instability and market volatility  sovereign debt issues  rising interest rates or inflation  terrorism or political uncertainty 
in the event of a continued or future market downturn in general and or the biotechnology sector in particular  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
in addition to the risks relating to our common stock  cvr holders are subject to additional risks 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of abraxis bioscience  inc in connection with our acquisition  contingent value rights or  cvrs  were issued under a cvr agreement entered into by and between us and american stock transfer trust company  llc  the trustee 
a copy of the cvr agreement was filed on form a with the sec on october  pursuant to the cvr agreement  each holder of a cvr is entitled to receive a pro rata portion  based on the number of cvrs then outstanding  of certain milestone and net sales payments  each of the following cash payments that we are obligated to pay 
see note  acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the risks relating to our common stock  cvr holders are subject to additional risks  including an active public market for the cvrs may not develop or the cvrs may trade at low volumes  both of which could have an adverse effect on the resale price  if any  of the cvrs  because a public market for the cvrs has a limited history  the market price and trading volume of the cvrs may be volatile  if the clinical approval milestones specified in the cvr agreement are not achieved for any reason within the time periods specified therein  and if net sales do not exceed the thresholds set forth in the cvr agreement for any reason within the time periods specified therein  no payment will be made under the cvrs and the cvrs will expire valueless  since the us federal income tax treatment of the cvrs is unclear  any part of any cvr payment could be treated as ordinary income and required to be included in income prior to the receipt of the cvr payment  any payments in respect of the cvrs are subordinated to the right of payment of certain indebtedness of ours  we may under certain circumstances redeem the cvrs  and upon expiration of our obligations to use diligent efforts to achieve each of the cvr milestones and to sell abraxane or any of the other abraxis pipeline products  we may discontinue such efforts  which would have an adverse effect on the value  if any  of the cvrs 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to service our obligations under our recently incurred indebtedness 
on october   we issued a total of billion principal amount of senior notes  consisting of the notes  the notes and the notes  collectively referred to as the notes 
our ability to pay interest on the notes  to repay the principal amount of the notes when due at maturity  to comply with the covenants of the notes or to 
table of contents repurchase the notes if a change of control occurs will depend upon  among other things  continued commercial success of our products and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance  including  without limitation  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  and regulatory factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt service requirements under the notes  we may be forced to take actions such as restructuring or refinancing our debt  including the notes  seeking additional debt or equity capital  reducing or delaying our business activities  acquisitions  investments or capital expenditures  or selling assets 
such measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our obligations under the notes 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business 
we rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business 
the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown  malicious intrusion and random attack 
likewise  data privacy breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
while we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems  there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 
we have certain charter and by law provisions that may deter a third party from acquiring us and may impede the stockholders ability to remove and replace our management or board of directors 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  at any time  without further stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  and to determine the price  rights  privileges and preferences of those shares 
an issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
additionally  our board of directors has adopted certain amendments to our by laws intended to strengthen the board s position in the event of a hostile takeover attempt 
these provisions could impede the stockholders ability to remove and replace our management and or board of directors

item legal proceedings we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent  commercial and other claims  government investigations  and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business

table of contents patent proceedings include challenges to scope  validity or enforceability of our patents relating to our various products or processes 
although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters  and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue  which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations

gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
revlimid is distributed in the united states primarily through contracted pharmacies under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 
internationally  revlimid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the product s safe and appropriate distribution and use 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies

table of contents the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza and abraxane are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk management distribution programs as thalomid and revlimid 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
full year revenues were negatively impacted by the us health care reform act which increased the medicaid rebate from to and extended that rebate to medicaid managed care organizations 
we utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental costs related to the medicaid managed care organizations 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  gpos and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula

internationally  thalomid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza and abraxane are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk management distribution programs as thalomid and revlimid 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
full year revenues were negatively impacted by the us health care reform act which increased the medicaid rebate from to and extended that rebate to medicaid managed care organizations 
we utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental costs related to the medicaid managed care organizations 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  gpos and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
upon receipt of chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information on these programs  we then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the us internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation the cost of share based compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of all awards granted  using the black scholes method of valuation 
the fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting 
compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security  our intent not to sell and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and  if it is  the type of hedging transaction 
for a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period  we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item 
we assess  both at inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments  if any  to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
investment in affiliated companies we apply the equity method of accounting to our investment in common stock of an affiliated company and certain investment funds  which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology  pharmaceuticals  medical technology  medical devices  diagnostics and health and wellness 

table of contents equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment 
if an investment s fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances 
factors considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include market value or exit price of the investment based on either market quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee  length of time that the market value was below its cost basis  financial condition and business prospects of the investee  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment  issues that raise concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern  and any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and performance measures for each ltip are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on non gaap earnings per share  on non gaap net income and on total non gaap revenue  as defined 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plans 
awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or an award based on actual performance  if higher  through the date of the change in control 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future non gaap earnings per share  non gaap net income and non gaap revenues  as defined  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d we have recorded goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d primarily through the acquisitions of pharmion  gloucester and abraxis 
when identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  are acquired  we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized  but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we test our goodwill annually for impairment each november we are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value  as determined by our traded share price  as compared to our book value of net assets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
intangible assets related to ipr d product rights are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets 
at that time  we will determine the useful life of the asset  reclassify the asset out of 
table of contents ipr d and begin amortization 
impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
our ipr d product rights were obtained in the gloucester and abraxis acquisitions 
the gloucester related product rights will become definite lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for istodax for treatment of ptcl in the united states and the european union 
the abraxis related product rights will become definite lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for abraxane for treatment of either nsclc  pancreatic cancer or melanoma in a major market  typically either the united states or the european union  or in a series of other countries  subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment 
valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date  and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of cvrs  adjustments to discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
the assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 
our contingent consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of gloucester and abraxis 
the fair value of the gloucester contingent consideration liability is based on the discount rates  probabilities and estimated timing of two cash milestone payments to the former gloucester shareholders 
the fair value of the abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on the quoted market price of the publicly traded cvrs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale  our long term debt  our note payable and certain foreign currency forward contracts 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us treasury securities  us government sponsored agency securities  us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities  non us government  agency and supranational securities  global corporate debt securities and marketable equity securities 
us government sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations either issued directly by or guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises 
us government sponsored agency mbs include mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the government national mortgage association 
non us government  agency and supranational securities  consist of direct obligations of highly rated governments of nations other than the united states  obligations of sponsored agencies and other entities that are guaranteed or supported by highly rated governments of nations other than the united states 
corporate debt global includes obligations issued by investment grade corporations including some issues that have been guaranteed by governments and government agencies 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  
table of contents net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges  is included in interest and investment income  net 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows duration less than more than year to years to years years total in thousands principal amount fair value average interest rate long term debt on october   we issued a total of billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at  and of par  respectively  and the discount amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity 
offering costs of approximately million have been recorded as debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance through maturity 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october each year beginning april  and the principal on each note is due in full at their respective maturity dates 
the notes may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  at any time at a redemption price defined in a make whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal 
if we experience a change of control accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below investment grade  we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we are subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving our property 
at december   the fair value of our senior notes outstanding was billion 
note payable in december  we purchased an active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  manufacturing facility and certain other assets and liabilities from siegfried 
at december   the fair value of our note payable to siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of million 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note 
the note is denominated in swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by changes in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the carrying value of the note reflects the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate and swiss interest rates 
foreign currency forward contracts we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with non functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at december  and had settlement dates within months 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under asc and  accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income loss  or oci  and reclassified to operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations 

table of contents any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income  net 
foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows notional amount december  foreign currency in thousands british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen swiss franc others total we consider the impact of our own and the counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract 
as of december   credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
we recognized an increase in net product sales for certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for and a reduction in net product sales of million for these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted sales occurred 
we recognized a decrease in other income  net for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for compared to an increase of million for these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted expenses occurred 
changes in time value  which we excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment  were included in other income  net 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges under asc and  accordingly  any changes in their fair value are recognized in other income  net in the current period 
the aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non designated hedging contracts outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately million 
however  since the contracts either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability 
on february   we entered into an interest rate swap contract to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure from fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and investment balances 
the floating rate is benchmarked to libor 
the swap is designated as a fair value hedge on the fixed rate debt issue maturing october since the specific terms and notional amount of the swap match those of the debt being hedged  it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all changes in fair value of the swaps will be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets with no net impact recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of this filing  the total notional amount of debt hedged with an interest rate swap is million
