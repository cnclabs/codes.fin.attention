services we provide high bandwidth connectivity solutions  primarily in three service groups fiber infrastructure services  metro services and wan services 
we also resell equipment and provide technical services to customers  which are sold at our cost  plus a margin 
unlike competitive local exchange carriers clecs  we do not provide voice services  services to residential customers or a wide range of lower bandwidth services 
fiber infrastructure services our fiber infrastructure services focus on the lease of dedicated dark fiber to telecommunications carriers  enterprises  internet and web centric businesses and other customers that operate their own networks independent of the incumbent telecom companies 
in addition to leasing dark fiber  we offer maintenance of dark fiber networks  the provisioning of co location and in building interconnection services  typically at our pop locations  and also provide certain telecommunication services on a time and materials basis 
our fiber infrastructure services feature an extensive network footprint that extends well beyond the central business district in most markets 
the expertise and capability to add off net locations to the network in a cost competitive manner 
modern  high quality fiber that meets stringent technical requirements 
customized ring configurations and redundancy requirements in a private dedicated service 
x monitoring of the network by our nmc 
demand for fiber services is driven by key business initiatives including business continuity and disaster recovery  network consolidation and convergence  growth of wireless communications  and industry specific applications such as high definition video transport and patient record management 
typically  fortune and ftse enterprises with data intensive needs in industries such as financial services  social networking  technology  media  retail  energy and healthcare comprise the target customer base for our fiber optic infrastructure offerings 
metro services we offer a number of high bandwidth metro service offerings in our active metro markets ranging from mbps to gbps connectivity 
these services range from simple point to point ethernet connectivity to complex multi node wavelength division multiplexing wdm solutions 
our metro services have a number of important features that differentiate us from many of our competitors a substantial portion of our metro services are deployed over dedicated fiber from end to end  or out from a shared router 
this dedicated fiber provides customers with significant scalability for any increasing traffic demand 
a service based on dedicated fiber provides a high level of security  a key concern for many high bandwidth customers across a range of industries 
our network architecture is not based on routing through central offices  which reduces network distances between customer locations and the resulting latency 
some of our metro services are offered without the need for the customer to provide space and power  which may be difficult or expensive to obtain in many data centers 
a significant portion of our service offerings are ethernet based  not older tdm based services 
we offer private  customized optical network deployments that we build for our largest customers with very specific needs 
these customers are typically large enterprise companies that have significant bandwidth requirements and value a completely private solution 
these solutions often involve extensive network construction to specific critical customer locations such as private data centers and trading platforms with dedicated wdm equipment configured in accordance with the customer s needs 
in the past several years  we have expanded our metro services capability beyond customers with very high bandwidth multiple wave requirements by offering a number of wave and ethernet products aimed to serve more moderate bandwidth circuit requirements 
these offerings include basic and enhanced wave services  which are based on dedicated  private fiber and equipment infrastructure from end to end and provide a solution for customers looking for a wdm based service between two metro locations 
the basic wave offering provides our lowest cost wave service  while our enhanced wave service has a slightly higher initial cost  but provides the customer substantial ability to expand its service capabilities 
we have also expanded our wdm solutions in a number of markets through our core wave offering  which provides wave services through pre positioned equipment and allows faster turn up of services and greater flexibility of use 
we also offer a full range of metro ethernet services including point to point and multi point service configurations at speeds from mbps to gbps mbps speeds 
we offer three different classes of our metro ethernet services with three different price points higher  middle and lower based upon level of service private metro ethernet which utilizes customer dedicated equipment and fiber to deliver a completely private service with all of the associated operational  performance and security benefits  dedicated metro ethernet which utilizes shared equipment with reserved guaranteed capacity  delivered to the customer location through dedicated fiber  and standard metro ethernet which utilizes shared equipment on a shared capacity basis  delivered to the customer location through dedicated fiber 
wan services we offer a number of wave  ethernet and ip based services within our wan services offering 
most of these services provide connectivity solutions between our metro markets and target high bandwidth customers requiring transmission speeds of at least mbps 
in addition  we provide high speed internet connectivity to our customers including high end enterprise  web centric and carrier cable companies 
each of our wan services is differentiated by our significant metro fiber resources that allow us to extend the capability of our core networks to the customer in a secure and cost effective manner 
our long haul services provide inter city connectivity between our metro markets on our ultra long haul network at a variety of speeds ranging from gbps to gbps 
our service offerings require a minimum of regeneration sites  which improves our ability to be competitive from both a price and speed of installation perspective while reducing the number of equipment interfaces required to deliver our service 
the attractiveness of our long haul services to our customers is further enhanced by our ability to extend the service from our long haul pop to the customer s premises through our metro networks  thereby providing an end to end solution 
this flexibility and reach enables us to provide our long haul services on a differentiated basis 
we operate a tier ip network that provides high quality internet connectivity for enterprise  web centric  internet and cable companies 
we offer connectivity to the internet at mbps  gbps and gbps port levels in most of our active metro markets in the us and europe 
we believe our extensive number of peering partners  global reach and uncongested network approach produces a positive experience for our customers 
in addition to selling ip connectivity at data centers and other major ip exchanges  we offer our metro ip service where we combine our metro fiber reach to deliver internet connectivity to customer premises 
this service offering extends our significant ip capability  without the dilutive impact of traditional  shared access methods  to the customer location over dedicated fiber that will support full port speeds 
we also offer a suite of advanced ethernet and ip vpn services that provide connectivity between multiple locations in different cities for our customers 
these services provide flexibility such as the ability to prioritize different traffic streams and the ability to converge multiple services across the same infrastructure 
these advanced vpn services  which include vpls services  offer point to point and multipoint connectivity solutions based on mpls technologies with the same high bandwidth scalability that our ip connectivity service allows 
unlike most of our competitors  these services can be extended from our pops to customer locations within one of our metro markets through dedicated fiber  thereby avoiding transitions through shared or legacy networks that can reduce performance quality 
sales and marketing our sales force is based across most of our current us and european service markets  is comprised of approximately sales professionals and is supported by a team of sales engineers who provide technical support during the sales process 
our sales force primarily focuses on enterprise customers  including fortune companies in the us and ftse companies in europe  that have large bandwidth requirements 
our sales strategy includes positioning ourselves as a premier provider of high bandwidth connectivity solutions 
focusing on fortune enterprises as well as content rich data companies ie media  health care and financial services that require customized private optical solutions 
expanding our sales reach through independent sales agents who specialize in specific geographic and vertical markets 
emphasizing the high quality  cost effective  secure and scalable nature of our private optical solutions 
communicating our capabilities through targeted marketing communication campaigns aimed at specific vertical markets to increase our brand awareness in a cost effective manner 
providing last mile lit solutions to long haul carriers who lack the capability to provide this to their customers 
capitalizing on our presence in over data center locations  which house it infrastructure for many enterprises and cloud computing capabilities 
leveraging our strong balance sheet with a willingness to invest capital to grow with our customers 
customers we serve a broad array of customers including leading companies in the financial services  web centric  media entertainment and telecommunications sectors  as well as certain local  state and federal government entities  in some cases through third party integrators 
our networks meet the requirements of many large enterprise customers with high data transfer and storage needs and stringent security demands 
major web centric companies similarly have needs for significant bandwidth and reliable networks 
media and entertainment companies that deliver bandwidth intensive video and multimedia applications over their networks are also a growing component of our customer base 
telecommunications service providers continue to utilize our networks to connect to their customers  as well as to data centers and other traffic aggregation points 
key drivers for growth in the consumption of telecommunications and bandwidth services include the increasing demand for disaster recovery and business continuity solutions  the emergence of cloud computing  the fast paced growth of social networking and gaming  compliance requirements under complex regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act or the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and exponential growth in data transmissions due to new modalities for communications  media distribution and commerce 
segments we operate our business as one operating segment and include segmented results based on geography 
below is our revenue based on the location of our entity providing the service 
long lived assets are based on the physical location of the assets

we test  combine and implement these technology developments to provide the highest level of services to our customers 
competition the telecom industry is intensely competitive and has undergone significant consolidation over the past few years 
although there are multiple reasons for this consolidation  among the most prominent is the need to create scale given the capital intense nature of building networks 
with respect to our larger competitors  verizon and at t formerly sbc have accounted for most of the consolidation through their purchases of mci and at t  respectively 
in the mid market  level was responsible for a significant portion of the consolidation by acquiring a large number of facilities based telecommunications providers 
more recently  lightower has combined a number of facilities based service providers in the new york and boston metro areas 
we face competition from clecs and other facilities based telecommunications providers including the ilecs who currently have a large share of the local markets and are aggressively deploying their own fiber 
clecs generally offer a much broader array of services than we do and tend to compete more directly with each other and the ilecs across a larger segment of customers than our customer base 
the internet connectivity business is intensely competitive and includes many providers such as at t  verizon  level  global crossing and cogent 
as a result of this competition  while internet traffic has continued to grow at a substantial rate over the past five years  pricing has declined significantly  which has negatively affected revenue growth 
our other wan services face significant competition from a number of providers including xo  global crossing and level our fiber infrastructure services face competition from numerous local and regional fiber providers and in some cases from clecs 
in the european market  we compete with a number of other telecommunications companies  including british telecom  cable wireless  colt telecom  global crossing and eu networks 
personnel our workforce levels have increased over the last three years as our business has expanded 
as of december   and our work force was deployed as follows december  us uk japan netherlands germany france total we consider our relations with our workforce to be good 
none of our employees is represented by a union 
regulation in the us  the federal communications commission  which we refer to as the fcc  and various state regulatory bodies regulate some aspects of certain of our services 
in some local jurisdictions  we must obtain approval to operate or construct our networks 
in europe  we are subject to regulation by the agencies having jurisdiction over the provision of transmission services 
in addition  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local taxes  fees or surcharges on our products and services 
federal in the us  federal telecommunications law directly shapes the market in which we compete 
we offer two types of services that fall under the jurisdiction of the fcc the leasing of dark fiber and the provision of telecommunications transmission services that are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the fcc pursuant to the provisions of the communications act of  as amended by the telecommunications act of  which we refer to as the communications act  and by fcc regulations implementing and interpreting the communications act 
dark fiber leasing 
the fcc considers dark fiber a network element and not a telecommunications service 
as a result  we believe that our provision of dark fiber is not subject to many of the legal requirements imposed on the sale of telecommunications services 
telecommunications services 
for most of our telecommunications services offerings  we are not required to provide such services on a common carrier basis ie  the provision of services to all customers on uniform terms and conditions 
our revenue from transmission services  whether or not provided as a common carrier  is subject to fcc universal service fund assessments to the extent that these services are purchased by end users ie  not by wholesale providers or resellers 
to the extent we provide telecommunications services on a common carrier basis  being regulated as a telecommunications carrier gives us certain legal benefits 
in particular  state and local governments have the obligation to manage access to the public rights of way in a competitively neutral nondiscriminatory manner to telecommunications carriers 
in addition  we are entitled to access existing telecommunications infrastructure by interconnecting our fiber optic networks with the ilecs central offices and other facilities 
under the communications act  ilecs must  among other things allow interconnection with other telecommunications carriers at any technically feasible point and provide service equal in quality to that provided to others  and provide other telecommunications carriers with access to their poles  ducts  conduits and other rights of way on just  reasonable and non discriminatory terms 
in most states  the fcc exercises jurisdiction over the rates that many power utilities and telecommunications carriers charge to other companies to lease space on their telephone poles or electrical towers or in their conduits in order to install fiber optic cable 
this jurisdiction derives from section of the federal communications act of  later expanded in the communications act 
the statute makes it possible for states to preempt the fcc s jurisdiction over rates for and access to poles and conduits where the state certifies to the fcc that it regulates such rates and access 
the purpose of the law is to make it easier for cable companies and competitive telecommunications providers to build out their own networks 
we have many pole attachment agreements with ilecs and power utilities some of these agreements reflect rates that were voluntarily negotiated  but many reflect rates established pursuant to the fcc s regulations  which implement provisions of section in recent years  some utilities have interpreted the regulations in a way that can impose what we believe to be excessive costs on competitive carriers  including us 
to the extent utilities are successful in maintaining these interpretations of the rules they can increase our cost of doing business 
in late  the fcc initiated rulemaking proceedings to examine the pole attachment rate formula  specifically  whether a single rate should apply to all attachers providing broadband services and  if so  upon what formula that rate should be based  whether incumbent local exchange carriers should be entitled to the same rate as other telecommunications service providers  and other related matters 
that proceeding remains pending 
a possible outcome of the proceeding is that our rates for access to the poles and conduit of utilities and other carriers could increase 
internet access services  including ip connectivity services that we provide  are treated as unregulated information services under title i of the communications act  and are not subject to regulatory fees 
the fcc has issued orders confirming that other forms of ip bandwidth services  including digital subscriber line service  cable modem service and broadband over powerline service  are defined as information services and so are not subject to regulatory fees 
however  the dramatic growth of voice over internet protocol voip services has caused intense focus on the regulatory status of ip services 
the fcc recently required that providers of interconnected voip service must provide access to emergency services  must comply with federal law enforcement and wiretap statutes  contribute to the federal universal service fund  and must pay certain regulatory fees 
some of these fcc decisions are under appeal before federal courts of appeals 
while these decisions have focused on providers of interconnected voip service  which we do not provide  there is nevertheless substantial uncertainty concerning the regulatory status of ip based services generally 
this general uncertainty raises the concern that the fcc may extend other traditional telecommunications regulation to voip and or other ip based services  including the ip connectivity services that we offer 
if this occurs  it could lead to an increase in the intercarrier compensation  universal service contributions and regulatory fees required to be paid by us related to such services 
the fcc adopted a national broadband plan nbp in march that is intended to serve as a roadmap for a host of regulatory measures and reforms that are intended to facilitate and accelerate the deployment of broadband services across the us the nbp is not self executing  it envisions a series of actions taken in related ongoing and future fcc proceedings to implement its recommendations 
some of the recommendations  if ultimately implemented  could be unfavorable to our business 
other nbp recommendations  if implemented  could be favorable to our business 
for example  we could benefit from implementation of a finding that low and uniform pole attachment rates should be established  and from implementation of policies designed to encourage a shift to ip to ip interconnection where efficient 
these and other nbp recommendations will be considered for implementation in a series of fcc proceedings over the next few years 
in february  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposes to substantially reform the current regulatory regime that applies to intercarrier compensation and distribution of federal universal service funding in ways that are consistent with nbp findings and recommendations 
state the communications act prohibits state and local governments from enforcing any law  rule or legal requirement that prohibits  or has the effect of prohibiting  any person from providing any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service 
this provision of the communications act enables us to provide telecommunications services in states that previously prohibited competitive entry 
under the communications act  states retain jurisdiction  on a competitively neutral basis  to adopt regulations necessary to preserve universal service  protect public safety and welfare  manage public rights of way  ensure the continued quality of intrastate communications services and safeguard the rights of consumers 
states are responsible for mediating and arbitrating interconnection agreements between ilecs and other carriers if voluntary agreements are not reached 
accordingly  state involvement in local telecommunications services is substantial 
each state and the district of columbia has its own statutory requirements for regulating providers of intrastate telecommunications services if they are common carriers or public utilities 
as with the federal regulatory scheme  we believe that our leasing of dark fiber facilities does not render us a common carrier or public utility such that we would be subject to this type of regulation in the provision of dark fiber in most jurisdictions in which we currently have facilities 
our offering of transmission services as distinct from leasing dark fiber capacity  however  is subject to regulation in each of these jurisdictions to the extent that these services are offered for intrastate use 
under current fcc policies  any dedicated transmission service or facility that the user certifies is used more than of the time for the purpose of interstate or foreign communications is subject to federal tariffs and rates  which fall under fcc jurisdiction to the exclusion of state regulation 
state regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly  and the regulatory environment varies substantially from state to state 
we are currently authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services in arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  delaware  the district of columbia  florida  georgia  illinois  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  south carolina  texas  utah  virginia  washington and west virginia 
at present  we do not anticipate that the regulatory requirements to which we will be subject in the states in which we currently operate or intend to operate will have any material adverse effect on our operations 
these regulations may require  among other things  that we maintain certifications to operate and utilize the public rights of way  that we obtain certain environmental approvals before we construct new facilities  and that we provide notification of  or obtain authorization for  specified corporate transactions  such as incurring debt or encumbering our telecommunications assets 
we will incur costs to comply with these and other regulatory requirements  such as the filing of tariffs  submission of periodic financial and operational reports to regulators  and payment of regulatory fees and assessments  including  in some states  contributions to state universal service programs 
notwithstanding federal and state laws and regulations requiring nondiscriminatory access to public rights of way  in some jurisdictions certain of our competitors  especially ilecs  have certain advantages by reason of having obtained approvals for operation under prior  less regulatory intensive regimes 
for example  in california  certain competitors of ours are subject to less rigorous environmental review procedures for proposed construction than we are  thereby enabling them potentially to construct new facilities more quickly than us and at a lower cost 
the issue is currently under review by the california public utility commission 
in some jurisdictions  our pricing flexibility for intrastate services may be limited because of regulation  although our direct competitors will be subject to similar restrictions 
some states may also impose a state universal service fund assessment on intrastate telecommunications services to fund state universal service projects 
the rate of assessment varies by state 
to the extent the state assessment applies to our dark fiber revenue or transmission services  we are required to pay into the state funds 
some states have certified to the fcc that they regulate the leasing of poles and conduits owned by incumbent utilities  including telecom  electric and gas utilities 
in many of these states  the pole attachment and conduit occupancy rates are calculated in a similar manner to that provided for by the fcc formulas implemented by the states  although in some cases state regulators have adjusted the fcc formula in certain respects 
in other states  although the state may have certified to the fcc that it regulates such rates  the state has not yet adopted clear rules regarding such matters 
where there are state adopted formulas  the rates generally are more advantageous than what we believe we could negotiate on a market basis 
the leasing of pole and conduit facilities in such states that have certified that they regulate pole and conduit rates and access is determined by a commercially negotiated contract as influenced by whatever state regulation is in place 
such regulations may change in the future to our disadvantage and additional states may certify to the fcc that they regulate pole and conduit access rates  terms and conditions  and such states may impose regulations that are less advantageous than are the fcc s regulations 
local in addition to federal and state laws  local governments exercise legal authority that can affect our business 
for example  local governments  such as the city of new york  typically manage access to public rights of way subject to the limitation that local governments may not prohibit persons from providing telecommunications services  may only collect fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers for access to public rights of way and may not treat telecommunications providers in a discriminatory manner 
because of the general need for telecommunications providers to obtain approvals from local governments to access the public rights of way  local authorities can affect the timing and costs associated with our use of public rights of way 
regulation of the internet laws and regulations that apply directly to the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the us congress frequently considers laws regarding privacy and security relating to the collection and transmission of information over the internet 
congress also addressed the need for regulation on the protection of children  copyrights  trademarks  domain names  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material over the internet 
the european union adopted its own privacy regulations and other countries may do so in the future 
other countries have taken actions to restrict the free flow of material deemed objectionable over the internet 
the scope of laws and regulations applicable to the internet is subject to conflicting interpretations and developments 
the applicability to the internet of laws and regulations from various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel and personal privacy is unsettled and may take years to resolve 
for example  the communications act prohibits the transmission of certain types of information and content over the internet but the scope of this prohibition is currently unsettled 
in addition  although the courts have held substantial parts of the communication decency act to be unconstitutional  federal or state governments may enact  and courts may uphold  similar legislation as well as laws covering issues such as intellectual property rights over the internet and the characteristics and quality of internet services and consumer protection laws 
in the us  federal agencies  such as the fcc and the federal trade commission  occasionally have overlapping jurisdiction in matters regarding privacy  consumer protection and fraud that are part of internet based services or transactions 
in addition  several state regulators and lawmakers also exercise jurisdiction in these areas 
foreign countries have also enacted laws in these fields 
the current application of most of these laws does not directly affect us in a material manner  although these laws do affect many of our internet connectivity customers 
the extent that internet connectivity providers such as ourselves are held directly or contributorily liable for violations of such laws by their customers or others involved with internet based services or transactions is an area of law that is only now becoming established  and it is possible that we may face increased legal liability and costs of legal compliance 
regulation in the european union european union regulation a package of five key european directives the framework directive  the authorisation directive  the access directive  the universal services directive and the privacy directive collectively known as the regime provide for a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks  services  interconnection and privacy in the european union 
under the framework directive  the european commission was required to review the effectiveness of the regime 
this review led to recent amendments involving the enactment of three legislative measures the better regulation directive that amends the framework directive  the access directive and the authorization directive  the citizens rights directive that amends the universal services directive and the privacy directive  and a regulation establishing the body of european regulators for electronic communications berec to ensure fair competition and more consistency of regulation of the telecommunications markets across the european union member states 
the better regulation directive and the citizens rights directive became effective as of december  and the berec became effective as of january  implementation of the regime and the new directives in respect of the regime  the european union member states were required to pass legislation to implement the regime 
france  germany  the netherlands and the uk  through various legislative enactments  have implemented the regime into their local law 
in respect of the better regulation directive and the citizens rights directive  european union member states this includes france  germany  the netherlands and the uk must adopt measures to implement these directives by may  it is not possible  at this stage  to assess the impact of these new directives on the french  german  dutch and uk telecommunications regulatory regimes 
regulation in the united kingdom in the uk  the communications act provides for a general authorization regime that imposes an obligation on electronic communication providers to comply with conditions  known as the general conditions of entitlement 
a breach of any of these conditions could lead the regulator  the office of communications ofcom  to impose fines and  potentially  suspend or revoke the right to provide electronic communications networks and services 
the communications act provides certain operators with code powers 
we hold such code powers as a result of automatic entitlement arising from our previous status as a license holder 
code powers provide operators with legal powers to construct and maintain networks on both public and private land  including the right to install networks on public highways 
we are entitled to provide electronic communication networks and services throughout the uk and are liable for property taxation business rates on the amount of fiber in use and in our control during each fiscal year 
these business rates are levied on companies by the uk local government authorities for the boroughs through which the fiber passes 
regulation in france  germany and the netherlands france  germany and the netherlands each have general authorization regimes that are similar to the uk and are administered by their respective regulatory authorities 
in each  we have secured the necessary registrations to provide publicly available electronic communications services and or operate a public electronic communications network 
as a result  we are subject to certain local general regulatory obligations in each jurisdiction  which include availability  secrecy  neutrality  safety measures and data retention 
in addition  we may be required to respond  whether periodically or on an ad hoc basis  to information requests of a technical  financial and commercial nature in order to allow such authority to calculate regulatory fees or further its market analysis or view on compliance 
corporate history we were formed as national fiber network  inc on april  and our name was changed to metromedia fiber network  inc also referred to as mfn on august  initially  we focused on providing dark fiber to carrier customers in the us and later  as we expanded  in europe 
in september  we acquired abovenet communications  inc  a data center facility and internet connectivity provider as well as paix 
net  inc  an abovenet communications  inc 
subsidiary that operated internet peering exchanges 
in february  we acquired sitesmith  inc  a provider of managed web hosting services 
in  in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy protection  we changed the name of our parent company to abovenet  inc and shifted our focus to taking advantage of our extensive fiber optic assets by selling high bandwidth solutions  primarily to enterprise customers 
as a result  we sold or disposed of businesses and assets not deemed central to this focus  including our managed web hosting services business and data center business

risk factors you should consider carefully  among other things  the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form k and in our other filings with the sec before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
if any of the identified risks actually occurs  or is adversely resolved  our consolidated financial statements could be materially  adversely impacted in a particular fiscal quarter or year and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer materially 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the identified risks are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial  also could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in our industry 
the telecommunications industry is extremely competitive  particularly with respect to price and service 
our failure to compete effectively with our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant increase in industry capacity or reduction in overall demand would adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase prices 
further  we anticipate that prices for certain telecommunications services such as ip bandwidth will continue to decline due to a number of factors including a price competition as various network providers attempt to gain market share to cover the fixed costs of their network investments and or install new networks that might compete with our networks  and b technological advances that permit substantial increases in the transmission capacity of many of our competitors networks 
in the telecommunications industry  we compete against ilecs  which have historically provided local telephone services and currently occupy significant market positions in their local telecommunications markets 
in addition to these carriers  several other competitors  such as facilities based communications service providers including clecs  cable television companies  electric utilities and large end users with private networks offer services similar to those offered by us 
many of our competitors have greater financial  managerial  sales and marketing and research and development resources than we do 
recently  certain competitors in our largest market have consolidated or undergone a change in control 
increased activity by these competitors could result in downward pricing pressure or loss of customers  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
problems in the economy could negatively affect our future operating results 
the problems in the economy could adversely affect our operations  by among other things  reducing and or delaying the demand for our services  increasing our customer churn  both with respect to customer terminations and with respect to reduced prices upon renewals of customer agreements  leading to reduced services from our vendors facing economic difficulties  and increasing the bad debts in our customer receivables 
these and other related factors could negatively affect our future operating results 
our franchises  licenses  permits  rights of way  conduit leases and property leases could be canceled or not renewed  which would impair our ability to provide our services 
we must maintain rights of way  franchises and other permits from railroads  utilities  state highway authorities  local governments  transit authorities and others to operate our networks 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining these right of way agreements or obtaining future agreements on acceptable terms 
some of these agreements may be short term or revocable at will  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to have access to existing rights of way after they have expired or terminated 
if a material portion of these agreements were terminated or could not be renewed and we were forced to abandon our networks  the termination could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in some cases landowners have asserted that railroad companies  utilities and others to whom they granted easements to their properties are not entitled as a result of these easements to grant rights of way to telecommunications providers 
if these disputes are resolved in the landowners favor  we could be obligated to make payments to these landowners for the lease of these rights of way or to indemnify the right of way holder for its losses 
in the past  we have had franchises and rights of way expire prior to executing a renewal and in the interim until such renewal was executed  operated without an agreement  which is the case currently with respect to our franchise agreement for our operations in the city of new york 
we expect that these situations will continue to occur in the future 
these expirations have not caused any material adverse effect on our operations in the past  and we do not expect that they will in the future 
however  to the extent that a municipality or other right of way holder attempts to terminate our related operations upon the expiration of a franchise or right of way agreement  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the result of certain ongoing litigation with a third party  the department of information technology and telecommunications of the city of new york doitt has informed us that they have temporarily suspended any discussions regarding renewals of telecommunications franchises in the city of new york 
as a result  it is our understanding that doitt has not renewed any recently expired franchise agreement  including our franchise agreement which expired on december  prior to the expiration of our franchise agreement  we sought out and received written confirmation from doitt that our franchise agreement provides a basis for us to continue to operate in the city of new york pending conclusion of renewal discussions 
we intend to continue to operate under our expired franchise agreement pending any renewal 
we believe that a number of other operators in the city of new york are operating on a similar basis 
based on our discussions with doitt and the written confirmation that we have received  we do not believe that doitt intends to take any adverse actions with respect to the operation of any telecommunications providers as the result of their expired franchise agreements and  that if it attempted to do so  it would face a number of legal obstacles 
nevertheless  any attempt by doitt to limit our operations as the result of our expired franchise agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to expand our network to new locations  we often need to obtain additional rights of way  franchises and other permits 
our failure to obtain these rights in a prompt and cost effective manner may prevent us from expanding our network which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and could expose us to liabilities and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose or are unable to renew key real property leases where we have located our pops  it could adversely affect our services and increase our costs as we would be required to restructure our network and move our pops 
we depend on third party service providers for important parts of our business operations and the failure of those third parties to provide their services could negatively affect our services 
we rely on third party service providers for important parts of our business  including most of the fibers on which our long haul network operates and significant portions of the conduits into which our fiber optic cables are installed in our metro networks 
if these third party providers fail to perform the services required under the terms of our contracts with them or fail to renew agreements on reasonable terms and conditions  it could materially and adversely affect the performance of our services  and we may experience difficulties locating alternative service providers on favorable terms  if at all 
we rely on equipment vendors to provide the telecommunications equipment that we use to provide services to our customers 
in the event  such equipment vendors do not continue to provide us equipment on a timely basis  or fail to provide reliable  high quality equipment  our operations could be negatively affected 
rapid technological changes could affect the continued use of our services 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology that could materially affect the continued use of our services 
changes in technology could negatively affect the desire of customers to purchase our existing services and may require us to make significant investments in order to meet customer demands for services incorporating new technologies 
we also cannot assure you that technological changes in the communications industry and internet related industry will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue growth may be negatively affected if we are unable to extend existing customer commitments 
while most of our revenue is derived from fixed term customer contracts  a meaningful portion of our revenue is generated from orders that are past their contractual expiration date for which we provide services that are billed on a month to month basis 
to the extent that our fixed term contractual revenue is not renewed or our month to month revenue is not extended or put under a new fixed term contract  our revenue growth and cash flow may be negatively affected 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our business is managed by certain key management and operating personnel 
we believe that the success of our business strategy and our ability to operate successfully depend on the continued employment of such employees and the ability to attract qualified employees 
we face significant competition from a wide range of companies in our recruiting efforts  and we could experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in the future 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy because we depend on factors beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our future largely depends on our ability to implement our business strategy to create new business and revenue opportunities 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot fully implement our business strategy 
successful implementation depends on numerous factors beyond our control  including economic  competitive  regulatory and other conditions and uncertainties  the ability to obtain licenses  permits  franchises and rights of way on reasonable terms and conditions and the ability to hire and retain qualified management personnel 
we may not be able to develop and maintain systems and controls to operate our business effectively 
we have experienced severe difficulties developing and maintaining financial and other systems necessary to operate our business properly and for a period of over six years we could not file our periodic reports with the sec for periods prior to december  our history of rapid initial growth  expansion through acquisitions with attendant integration issues  significant reorganization and restructuring activities and associated significant staffing reductions  budgetary constraints and attendant limitations on investment in internal systems had contributed to the risk of internal control deficiencies 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act  management is required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on a periodic basis 
pursuant to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december  and  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  and our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  and as of december  as we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
these weaknesses meant that there was more than a remote likelihood that we would not prevent or detect a material misstatement in our financial statements 
if we are unable to upgrade and improve our systems  or if the upgrading of such systems is not properly implemented  it could adversely affect our current levels of operations and our ability to grow 
changes in our traffic patterns or industry practice could result in increasing peering costs for our ip network 
peering agreements with other internet service providers allow us to access the internet and exchange traffic with these providers 
in most cases  we peer with other internet service providers on a payment free basis  referred to as settlement free peering 
if other providers change the terms upon which they allow settlement free peering or if changes in our internet traffic patterns  including the ratio of our inbound to outbound traffic  cause us to fall below the criteria that these providers use in allowing settlement free peering  the costs of operating our internet backbone will likely increase 
any increases in costs could have an adverse effect on our margins and our ability to compete in the internet services market 
we are required to maintain  repair  upgrade and replace our network and facilities  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
our business requires that we maintain  upgrade  repair and periodically replace our facilities and networks 
this requires and will continue to require  management time and the expenditure of capital on a regular basis 
in the event that we fail to maintain  upgrade or replace essential portions of our network or facilities  it could lead to a material degradation in the level of services that we provide to our customers which would adversely affect our business 
our networks can be damaged in a number of ways  including by other parties engaged in construction close to our network facilities 
in the event of such damage  we will be required to incur expenses to repair the network in order to maintain services to customers 
we could be subject to significant network repair and replacement expenses in the event a terrorist attack or natural disaster damages our network 
further  the operation of our network requires the coordination and integration of sophisticated and highly specialized hardware and software technologies 
our failure to maintain or properly operate this hardware and software can lead to degradations or interruptions in service 
our failure to provide a higher level of service can result in claims from our customers for credits or damages and can damage our reputation for service  thereby limiting future sales opportunities 
governmental regulation may negatively affect our operations 
existing and future government laws and regulations greatly influence how we operate our business 
us federal and state laws directly shape the telecommunications and internet markets 
consequently  regulatory requirements and changes could adversely affect our operations and also influence the markets for telecommunications and internet services 
we cannot predict the future regulatory framework of our business 
local governments also exercise legal authority that may have an adverse effect on our business because of our need to obtain rights of way for our fiber networks 
while local governments may not prohibit persons from providing telecommunications services nor treat telecommunication service providers in a discriminatory manner  they can affect the timing and costs associated with our use of public rights of way 
government regulation of the internet may subject us to liability 
laws and regulations that apply to the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the us congress has considered internet laws regarding privacy and security relating to the collection and transmission of information over the internet  entrusting the federal trade commission with strong enforcement power 
the us congress also has adopted laws that regulate the protection of children  copyrights  trademarks  domain names  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material over the internet 
the european union adopted its own privacy regulations and other countries may do so in the future 
other nations have taken actions to restrict the free flow of material deemed objectionable over the internet 
the scope of many of these laws and regulations is subject to conflicting interpretations and significant uncertainty that may take years to resolve 
as a result of this uncertainty  we may be exposed to direct liability for our actions and to contributory liability for the actions of our customers or information distributed over our networks 
requests to relocate portions of our network can result in additional expenses 
we are periodically required to relocate portions of our network by municipalities  railroads  highway authorities and other entities that engage in construction or other activities in areas close to our network 
these relocations can be expensive and time consuming to management and can result in interruptions of service to customers 
if we are required to engage in an increased amount of relocation activities resulting from increased government spending on infrastructure or other reasons  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred significant net losses and we cannot assure you that we will generate net income or that we will sustain positive operating cash flow in the future 
we incurred net losses from our inception through december  in  we generated net income  principally from the sale of our remaining data centers and in   and  we generated operating income and net income 
the net income reported for included the non cash gain of million on the reversal of foreign currency translation adjustments from the liquidation of certain subsidiaries 
the net income reported for of million included termination fees of million as described in note  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the net income reported for of million included the recognition of non cash tax benefits of million relating to the reduction of certain valuation allowances previously established in the us and the us in order for us to continue to generate positive operating cash flow and net income  we will need to continue to obtain new customers  increase our revenue from our existing customers and manage our costs effectively 
in the event we are unable to do so  or if we lose customers  we may not be able to continue to generate operating cash flow or net income in the future 
if our operations do not produce sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional capital through a debt or equity financing 
in and  we utilized cash in excess of our cash from operating activities to fund additional investments in property and equipment thus reducing our liquidity 
if our operating expenses or our investments in property and equipment increase  we may need to rely on our existing cash balance and funds available under our million secured revolving credit facility described below to meet our cash needs 
our future capital requirements may increase if we acquire or invest in additional businesses  assets  services or technologies  which may require us to issue additional equity or debt 
we may also face unforeseen capital requirements for new technology that we require to remain competitive or to comply with new regulatory requirements  for unforeseen maintenance of our network and facilities and for other unanticipated expenses associated with running our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to necessary capital  nor can we assure you that any such financing will be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we issue equity securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may be diluted 
additionally  our million secured revolving credit facility imposes limitations on the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur 
we have incurred secured indebtedness 
at february   we had million outstanding under our million revolving secured credit facility the million secured revolving credit facility  which we closed on january  the million secured revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets and of our ownership interests in abovenet  inc s directly owned foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of the proceeds drawn at closing was used to repay in full and terminate our then existing secured credit facility the secured credit facility and the remaining capacity is available for general corporate purposes  including capital investment 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to repay the loans due under the million secured revolving credit facility 
additionally  we may not be able to satisfy the requirements under the loan covenants 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
demand for our services from certain customers in the financial services industry may be negatively affected by regulatory changes 
certain of our financial services customers utilize our networks for high frequency trading 
to the extent that regulatory changes restrict this activity  the needs of these customers for our services may be reduced or eliminated 
prior to the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of we had not made any timely periodic filings with the sec required by the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  from through september  since filing our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we have made all periodic filings on a timely basis 
as a result of our past failure to make timely periodic filings with the sec  we could be subject to civil penalties and other administrative proceedings by the sec 
our inability to produce audited financial statements prevented us from filing our federal and state income taxes in a timely manner 
because we were unable to produce audited financial statements on a timely basis  we delayed the filing of our federal and state income tax returns for to in january  we filed the to income tax returns and in december  we filed our income tax returns for the years ended december  and our income tax returns for and were timely filed 
however  we are still subject to federal and state tax audits 
we believe that we will not owe any material amount of income taxes  related penalties or interest in these jurisdictions due to the losses incurred by us 
we cannot predict our future tax liabilities 
if we become subject to increased levels of taxation  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we provide telecommunication and other services in multiple jurisdictions across the united states and europe and are therefore subject to multiple sets of complex and varying tax laws and rules 
we cannot predict the amount of future tax liabilities to which we may become subject 
any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of our operations or due to legislative or regulatory changes could result in a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe that our current provisions for taxes are reasonable and appropriate  we cannot assure you that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued or that we will not identify additional exposures in the future 
customer agreements contain service level and delivery obligations that could subject us to liability or the loss of revenue 
our contracts with customers generally contain service guarantees and service delivery date targets  which if not met by us  enable customers to claim credits against their payments to us and  under certain conditions  terminate their agreements 
if we are unable to meet our service level guarantees or service delivery dates  it could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
our charter documents  our amended and restated stockholders rights agreement and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated by laws  our amended and restated stockholders rights agreement and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that would provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
our amended and restated stockholders rights agreement has significant anti takeover effects by causing substantial dilution under certain circumstances to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
in addition  the authorization of undesignated preferred stock gives our board of directors the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire control of us 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  this premium may not be realized or the market price of our common stock could decline 
future sales  or the perception of future sales  of a substantial amount of our shares of common stock could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
in august  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a form s shelf registration statement on behalf of certain funds advised by franklin mutual advisers  llc that beneficially own an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
these shares  which may be offered and sold from time to time  represent of our outstanding shares based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares  or the perception that these sales might occur  could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
our revenue includes certain fees that are not predictable 
historically  a portion of our revenue has included certain termination payments received by the company to settle contractual commitments  which are referred to as termination revenue 
additionally  we have received settlements of our claims in various customer bankruptcy cases  which is also included in termination revenue 
consolidated termination revenue amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this revenue is not predictable and may not be sustainable

item properties our principal properties currently are fiber optic networks and their component assets 
we own substantially all of the communications equipment required for operating our networks and our business 
such assets are located at leased locations in the areas that we serve 
we lease our principal executive offices in white plains  new york and london  uk  as well as significant sales  administrative and other support offices 
we lease properties to locate the pops necessary to operate our networks 
our executive office located at hamilton avenue  white plains  new york is approximately  square feet and leased under an agreement that expires in may office and pop space is leased in the markets where we maintain our networks and generally ranges from to  square feet under agreements that expire over the next years as of december   with the majority of leases expiring over the next years

our existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business 
we do not own any real property 
as of december   we conducted our business in the us through operating leases totaling approximately  rentable square feet 
item legal proceedings our significant legal proceedings are as follows we were a party to a fiber lease agreement with sbc telecom  inc sbc  a subsidiary of at t  entered into in may we believed that sbc was obligated under this agreement to lease  fiber miles  reducible to  under certain circumstances  for a term of years at a price set forth in the agreement  which was subject to adjustment based upon the number of fiber miles leased the higher the volume of fiber miles leased  the lower the price per fiber mile 
sbc disagreed with such interpretation of the agreement and in  the issue was litigated before the bankruptcy court of the southern district court of new york the bankruptcy court 
in november  the bankruptcy court agreed with our interpretation of the agreement  which decision sbc did not appeal 
subsequently  sbc also alleged that we were in breach of our obligations under such agreement and that therefore we were unable to assume the agreement upon our emergence from bankruptcy 
we disagreed with sbc s position  however in december  the bankruptcy court agreed with sbc 
in  we appealed certain aspects of the decision to the district court for the southern district of new york but the district court denied our appeal 
in march  we filed a notice of appeal to the second circuit court of appeals seeking relief with respect to the bankruptcy court s determination that we were in default of the agreement with sbc 
during the term of the agreement  sbc paid us at the higher rate per fiber mile to reflect the reduced volume of services sbc believed it was obligated to take  in accordance with its understanding of the fiber lease agreement 
however  for financial statement purposes  we recorded revenue based on the lower amount per fiber mile for the fiber miles accepted by sbc  which was million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and in july  we and sbc entered into the stipulation and release agreement under which a new service agreement was executed for the period from july  to december  under this new service agreement  sbc agreed to continue to purchase the existing services at the current rate being paid by sbc for such services 
further  sbc will have a fixed minimum payment commitment  which declines over the contract term 
sbc may cancel service at any time  subject to the notice provisions  but is subject to the payment commitment 
the payment commitment may be satisfied by the existing services or sbc may order new services 
additionally  the may fiber lease agreement was terminated and we and sbc released each other from any claims related to that agreement 
the difference between the amount paid by sbc and the amount recognized by us as revenue  which aggregated million at july  million at december   was recorded as contract termination revenue for the year ended december abovenet communications uk limited  our principal uk operating subsidiary acuk  was a party to a duct purchase and fiber lease agreement the duct purchase agreement with eu networks fiber uk ltd  formerly global voice networks limited gvn 
a dispute between the parties arose regarding the extent of the network duct that was sold and fiber that was leased to gvn pursuant to the duct purchase agreement 
as a result of this dispute  in  gvn filed a claim against acuk in the high court of justice in london seeking ownership of the disputed portion of the network duct  the right to lease certain fiber and associated damages 
in december  the court ruled in favor of gvn with respect to the disputed duct and fiber 
in early february  acuk delivered most of the disputed duct and fiber to gvn 
additionally  under the original ruling  we were also required to construct the balance of the disputed duct and fiber and deliver it to gvn pursuant to a schedule ordered by the court 
additional portions of the disputed duct and fiber were constructed and subsequently delivered and other portions are scheduled for delivery 
we also had certain repair and maintenance obligations that we must perform with respect to such duct 
gvn was also seeking to enforce an option requiring acuk to construct to chambers for gvn along the network 
in june  we paid million in damages pursuant to the ruling in the liability trial 
additionally  we reimbursed gvn million for legal fees and incurred our own legal fees of million 
further  we have incurred or are obligated for costs totaling million to build additional network 
in early august  we reached a settlement agreement under which we paid gvn million and agreed to provide additional construction of duct at an estimated cost of million and provide gvn limited additional access to acuk s network 
gvn and acuk provided mutual releases of all claims against each other  including acuk s repair obligation and the chamber construction obligations discussed above 
we recorded a loss on litigation of at december  through december   we paid million in connection with this litigation 
during  we provided an additional million to record additional expenses for repairs covered by the settlement 
the obligations were denominated in british pounds  and accordingly  the amounts have been adjusted for changes in currency translation rates over the years

upon emergence from bankruptcy on september  the effective date  we adopted fresh start accounting and reporting in accordance with statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code now known as financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  which resulted in material adjustments to the historical carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities 
fresh start accounting required us to allocate the reorganization value to our assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values 
adopting fresh start accounting has resulted in material adjustments to the historical carrying amount of our assets and liabilities 
we engaged an independent appraiser to assist in the allocation of the reorganization value  and in determining the fair market value of our property and equipment and overall enterprise value 
the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities is subject to significant estimation and assumptions

executive summary overview we provide data transport services primarily in and between major metropolitan markets in the us and four in europe 
our services include high bandwidth fiber optic connectivity solutions primarily to large corporate enterprise clients and communication carriers that have large bandwidth transport requirements  including fortune and ftse companies  as well as governmental entities  in the us and europe 
the components of our operating income are revenue  costs of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
below is a description of these components 
we are reporting operating income for each of the years ended december   and  as shown in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the demand for high bandwidth data transport services continues to increase 
we believe that our experience in the provision of these services  our customer base and our robust and extensive network should enable us to take advantage of this growing demand 
although the competitive landscape in our industry is challenging and constantly shifting  we believe that we are well positioned for continued growth in the future 
strategy see item  business business strategy  for a discussion of our business strategy 
key performance indicators our senior management reviews a group of financial and non financial performance metrics in connection with the management of our business 
these metrics facilitate timely and effective communication of results and key decisions  allowing management to react quickly to changing requirements and changes in our key performance indicators 
some of the key financial indicators we use include cash flow  monthly expense analysis  new customer installations  net new revenue booked  capital committed and expended and net revenue attrition 
we define net revenue attrition as the reduction in monthly recurring revenue mrr for customers with net decreases in mrr as a result of terminations  price declines and other decreases  which are offset by any increases divided by total revenue excluding contract termination revenue over a given period 
some of the most important non financial performance metrics measure headcount  ip traffic growth  installation intervals and network service performance levels 
we manage our employee headcount changes to ensure sufficient resources are available to service our customers and control expenses 
all employees have been categorized into  and are managed within  integrated groups such as sales  operations  engineering  finance  legal and human resources 
our worldwide headcount was as of december   of which were employed in the us  in the us and one each in the netherlands  germany  france and japan 
highlights our consolidated revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   which included a million increase in our domestic metro services 
additionally  in the us  our revenue from fiber infrastructure and wan services increased by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated other revenue which includes contract termination revenue of million was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from our foreign operations  primarily in the uk  increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   we generated operating income of million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  and net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  at december   we had million of unrestricted cash  compared to million of unrestricted cash at december   a decrease in liquidity of million 
the decrease in cash at december  was primarily attributable to the payment of million pursuant to the special cash dividend of per share  plus cash used for purchases of property and equipment of million and debt principal repayments of million  partially offset by cash generated by operating activities of million plus cash provided by the exercise of stock purchase warrants and options to purchase shares of common stock totaling million 
in november  we received a commitment from suntrust bank for a million secured revolving credit facility  which closed in january for the year ended december   our cash flow generated by operating activities increased compared to as a result of the improvement in operating results described above 
we believe  based on our business plan  that our existing cash  cash from our operating activities and funds available under our million secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements at least through march  significant and continuous judgment of management is required in determining the provision for income tax  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and related valuation allowance established against the deferred tax assets 
as part of our evaluation of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash tax benefit of million 
this benefit related to the partial release of valuation allowances previously established in the uk in total  the valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets decreased by million in  which was comprised of the reversal of million described above and million due to the future reduction in statutory tax rates in the uk  partially offset by million attributable to foreign currency translation 
outlook we believe that based upon our contracted projects awaiting delivery to customers and our sales pipeline  we will continue to add to our revenue base in we have access to financing through our million secured revolving credit facility  if needed 
sales orders for the year ended december  were higher than sales orders for the year ended december  while net revenue attrition  as previously defined  for the year ended december  was in line with net revenue attrition for the year ended december   we cannot predict our net revenue attrition for while most of our revenue is derived from fixed term customer contracts  a meaningful portion of our revenue is generated from orders that are past their contractual expiration date for which we provide services that are billed on a month to month basis 
to the extent that our fixed term contractual revenue is not renewed or our month to month revenue is not extended or put under a new fixed term contract  our revenue growth and cash flow may be negatively affected 
in early  we announced a number of growth initiatives  which included expansion of services to several new markets in the us and europe 
these included connecting miami to our long haul network  opening the denver metro market and providing certain services over leased fiber in paris  amsterdam and frankfurt 
we expect that we will begin to earn revenue in these markets in in  we also increased our investments in customer capital capital spent to fulfill customer service orders for laterals to customer locations including both enterprise locations and data centers and backbone network infrastructure investments in our existing markets in order to extend the reach of our networks and improve services to existing and prospective customers and increase revenue opportunities 
for  we will continue to make these investments in customer capital and infrastructure to increase the reach of our networks 
revenue revenue derived from leasing fiber optic data transport infrastructure and the provision of data transport and co location services is recognized as services are provided 
non refundable payments received from customers before the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently amortized into income over the fixed contract term 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from multi year contracts for services we provide 
we are often required to make an initial outlay of capital to extend our network and purchase equipment for the provision of services to our customers 
under the terms of most contracts  the customer is required to pay a termination fee or contractual damages which decline over the contract term if the contract were terminated by the customer without basis before its expiration to ensure that we recover our initial capital investment  plus an acceptable return 
we also derive revenues from annual and month to month contracts 
costs of revenue costs of revenue primarily include the following i real estate expenses for all operational sites  ii costs incurred to operate our networks  such as licenses  right of way  permit fees and professional fees related to our networks  iii third party telecommunications  fiber and conduit expenses  iv repairs and maintenance costs incurred in connection with our networks  and v employee related costs relating to the operation of our networks 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a primarily consist of i employee related costs such as salaries and benefits for employees not directly attributable to the operation of our networks  in addition to stock based compensation expenses and incentive bonus expenses for all employees  ii real estate expenses for all administrative sites  iii professional  consulting and audit fees  iv certain taxes other than income taxes  including property taxes and trust fund related taxes not passed through to customers  and v regulatory costs  insurance  telecommunications costs  professional fees  and license and maintenance fees for internal software and hardware 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consists of the ratable measurement of the use of property and equipment 
depreciation and amortization for network assets commences when such assets are placed in service and is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  with the exception of leasehold improvements  which are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management continually evaluates its judgments  estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and available information 
the following is a discussion of the items within our consolidated financial statements that involve significant judgments  assumptions  uncertainties and estimates 
the estimates involved in these areas are considered critical because they require high levels of subjectivity and judgment to account for highly uncertain matters  and if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by management in making these estimates  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
for a full description of our significant accounting policies  see note  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fresh start accounting our emergence from bankruptcy resulted in a new reporting entity with no retained earnings or accumulated losses  effective as of september  although the effective date of the plan of reorganization was september   we accounted for the consummation of the plan of reorganization as if it occurred on august  and implemented fresh start accounting as of that date 
there were no significant transactions during the period from august  to september  fresh start accounting requires us to allocate the reorganization value of our assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values  in accordance with fasb asc we developed a set of financial projections  which were utilized by an expert to assist us in estimating the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the expert utilized various valuation methodologies  including a comparison of the company and our projected performance to that of comparable companies  a review and analysis of several recent transactions of companies in similar industries to ours  and a calculation of the enterprise value based upon the future cash flows of our projections 
adopting fresh start accounting resulted in material adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
the reorganization value was allocated to our assets and liabilities based upon their fair values 
we engaged an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair market value of our property and equipment 
the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities was subject to significant estimates and assumptions 
the unaudited fresh start adjustments reflected at september  consisted of the following i reduction of property and equipment  ii reduction of indebtedness  iii reduction of vendor payables  iv reduction of the carrying value of deferred revenue  v increase of deferred rent to fair market value  vi cancellation of mfn s common stock and additional paid in capital  in accordance with the plan of reorganization  vii issuance of new abovenet  inc common stock and additional paid in capital  and viii elimination of the comprehensive loss and accumulated deficit accounts 
revenue recognition we follow sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  now known as fasb asc  as amended by sec sab no 
 revenue recognition  also now known as fasb asc 
revenue derived from leasing fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of telecommunications and co location services is recognized as services are provided 
non refundable payments received from customers before the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently amortized into income over the fixed contract term 
prior to october   we generally amortized revenue related to installation services on a straight line basis over the contracted customer relationship two to twenty years 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a study of our historic customer relationship period 
as a result  commencing october   we began amortizing revenue related to installation services on a straight line basis generally over the estimated customer relationship period generally ranging from three to twenty years 
contract termination revenue is recognized when a customer discontinues service prior to the end of the contract period for which we had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
contract termination revenue is also recognized when customers have made early termination payments to us to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when we renegotiate or discontinue a contract with a customer and as a result are no longer obligated to provide services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
additionally  we include receipts of bankruptcy claim settlements from former customers as contract termination revenue when received 
contract termination revenue amounted to million  million and  million in  and  respectively 
accounts receivable reserves sales credit reserves during each reporting period  we make estimates for potential future sales credits to be issued in respect of current revenue  related to service interruptions and customer disputes  which are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
we analyze historical credit activity and changes in customer demand related to current billing and service interruptions when evaluating our credit reserve requirements 
we reserve for known service interruptions as incurred 
we review customer disputes and reserve against those we believe to be valid claims 
we also estimate a sales credit reserve related to unknown billing errors and disputes based on such historical credit activity 
the determination of the general sales credit and customer dispute credit reserve requirements involves significant estimations and assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts during each reporting period  we make estimates for potential losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze our reserve requirements using several factors  including the length of time a particular customer s receivables are past due  changes in the customer s creditworthiness  the customer s payment history  the length of the customer s relationship with us  the current economic climate and current industry trends 
a specific reserve requirement review is performed on customer accounts with larger balances 
a reserve analysis is also performed on accounts not subject to specific review utilizing the factors previously mentioned 
changes in the financial viability of significant customers  worsening of economic conditions and changes in our ability to meet service level requirements may require changes to our estimate of the recoverability of the receivables 
revenue previously unrecognized  which is recovered through litigation  negotiations  settlements and judgments  is recognized as termination revenue in the period collected 
the determination of both the specific and general allowance for doubtful accounts reserve requirements involves significant estimations and assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment owned at the effective date are stated at their estimated fair values as of the effective date based on our reorganization value  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization incurred since the effective date 
purchases of property and equipment subsequent to the effective date are stated at cost  net of depreciation and amortization 
major improvements are capitalized  while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred 
costs incurred prior to a capital project s completion are reflected as construction in progress and are part of network infrastructure assets  as described below and included in property and equipment on the respective balance sheets 
at december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of construction in progress 
certain internal direct labor costs of constructing or installing property and equipment are capitalized 
capitalized direct labor is determined based upon a core group of project managers  field engineers  network infrastructure engineers and equipment engineers 
capitalized direct labor is based upon time spent on capitalized projects and consists of salary  plus related benefits 
these individuals capitalized labor costs are directly associated with the construction and installation of network infrastructure and equipment and customer installations 
the salaries and related benefits of non engineers and supporting staff that are part of the operations and engineering departments are not considered part of the pool subject to capitalization 
capitalized direct labor amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  with the exception of leasehold improvements  which are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are as follows network infrastructure assets and storage huts except for risers  which are years years hvac and power equipment to years software and computer equipment to years transmission and ip equipment to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years leasehold improvements lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease when property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts  and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net income 
from time to time  we are required to replace or re route existing fiber due to structural changes such as construction and highway expansions  which is defined as relocation 
in such instances  we fully depreciate the remaining carrying value of network infrastructure removed or rendered unusable and capitalize the costs of the new fiber and associated construction placed into service 
in certain circumstances  the local municipality or agency is responsible for some or all of such amounts 
we record our share of relocation costs in property and equipment and record the third party portion of such costs as accounts receivable 
we capitalized relocation costs amounting to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we fully depreciated the remaining carrying value of the network infrastructure rendered unusable  which on an original cost basis  totaled million million on a net book value basis for the year ended december  and  which on an original cost basis  totaled million million on a net book value basis for each of the years ended december  and to the extent that relocation requires only the movement of existing network infrastructure to another location  the related costs are included in our results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  now known as fasb asc  interest on certain construction projects would be capitalized 
such amounts were considered immaterial  and accordingly  no such amounts were capitalized during the years ended december   and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  now known as fasb asc  we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets and evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets 
we consider various factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary 
the factors include consideration of the overall economic climate  technological advances with respect to equipment  our strategy  capital planning and certain operational issues 
since june   no event has occurred nor has the business environment changed to trigger an impairment test for assets in revenue service and operations 
we also consider the removal of assets from the network as a triggering event for performing an impairment test 
once an item is removed from service  unless it is to be redeployed  it may have little or no future cash flows related to it 
we performed annual physical counts of such assets that are not in revenue service or operations eg  inventory  primarily spare parts at or around september  and with the assistance of a valuation report of the assets in inventory  prepared by an independent third party on a basis consistent with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  now known as fasb asc  and pursuant to fasb asc  we determined that the fair value of certain of these assets was less than the carrying value and accordingly  recorded provisions for impairment of million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and additionally  at december   we recorded a million provision for impairment with respect to a discreet group of assets because of certain operational issues 
the company also recorded a provision for equipment impairment of million in the year ended december  to record the loss in value of certain equipment  most of which was eventually sold to an unaffiliated third party 
see note  change in estimate  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  now known as fasb asc  we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we have asset retirement obligations related to the de commissioning and removal of equipment  restoration of leased facilities and the removal of certain fiber and conduit systems 
considerable management judgment is required in estimating these obligations 
important assumptions include estimates of asset retirement costs  the timing of future asset retirement activities and the likelihood of contractual asset retirement provisions being enforced 
changes in these assumptions based on future information could result in adjustments to these estimated liabilities 
asset retirement obligations are generally recorded as other long term liabilities  are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets included in property and equipment  net  and are depreciated over the life of the associated asset 
asset retirement obligations aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were included in accrued expenses  and million and million  respectively  were included in other long term liabilities at such dates 
accretion expense  which is included in interest expense  amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and derivative financial instruments we have utilized and may  from time to time in the future  utilize derivative financial instruments known as interest rate swaps derivatives to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
we purchased the first interest rate swap on august  to hedge the interest rate on the initial million original principal term loan under the secured credit facility and we purchased a second interest rate swap on november  to hedge the interest rate on the additional million original principal term loan under the secured credit facility provided by suntrust bank 
see note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we accounted for the derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  now known as fasb asc 
fasb asc requires that all derivatives be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them 
by policy  we have not historically entered into derivatives for trading purposes or for speculation 
based on criteria defined in fasb asc  the interest rate swaps were considered cash flow hedges and were effective 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivatives have been recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings in the period in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges  if any  is recognized in current period earnings 
the unrealized net loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  and were million and million  respectively  for the interest rate swaps 
the mark to market value of the cash flow hedges is recorded in current assets  current liabilities  other non current assets or other long term liabilities  as applicable  and the offsetting gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 now known as fasb asc 
fasb asc changes the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivatives  ii how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb asc  and iii how derivatives and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position and cash flows 
we minimize our credit risk relating to counterparties of our derivatives by transacting with multiple  high quality counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to individual counterparties  and by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties 
all derivatives were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
accounting for the gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting in accordance with fasb asc at december   net interest rate swap derivative liabilities of million were included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet and at december   net interest rate swap derivative liabilities of million were included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
derivatives recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  consisted of the following derivative liabilities derivatives designated as hedging instruments december  december  interest rate swap agreement expiring august  interest rate swap agreement expiring november  total derivatives designated as hedging instruments the derivative liabilities are two interest rate swap agreements with original three year terms  which were included in accrued expenses in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and other long term liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  interest rate swap agreements the notional amounts provide an indication of the extent of our involvement in such agreements but do not represent our exposure to market risk 
the following table shows the notional amount outstanding  maturity date  and the weighted average receive and pay rates of the interest rate swap agreements as of december  notional amount weighted average rate in millions maturity date pay receive august november interest expense under these agreements  and the respective debt instruments that they hedge  are recorded at the net effective interest rate of the hedged transaction 
the notional amounts of the swap arrangements have since been reduced by amounts corresponding to reductions in the outstanding principal balances 
the swap agreements were settled in january in connection with the repayment of the term loans under the secured credit facility and the closing of the million secured revolving credit facility 
the cost of million to settle the swap agreements will be included in other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended march  fair value of financial instruments we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
now known as fasb asc  for our financial assets and liabilities effective january  this pronouncement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb asc emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost  which are each based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
fasb asc utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to fair value measurement techniques into three broad levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
our investment in overnight money market institutional funds  which amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  is included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying balance sheets and is classified as a level asset 
we are party to two interest rate swaps  which are utilized to modify our interest rate risk 
we recorded the mark to market value of the interest rate swap contracts of million which was included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet at december   and million which was included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december  we used third parties to value each of the interest rate swap agreements at december  and december   as well as our own market analysis to determine fair value 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts are classified as level liabilities 
our consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments short term cash investments  trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and note payable 
we believe the carrying amounts in the financial statements approximate the fair value of these financial instruments due to the relatively short period of time between the origination of the instruments and their expected realization or the interest rates which approximate current market rates 
the swap agreements were settled in january in connection with the repayment of the term loans under the secured credit facility and the closing of the million secured revolving credit facility 
the cost of million to settle the swap agreements will be included in other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended march  concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk  consist principally of short term cash investments and accounts receivable 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in investment grade  short term investment instruments with high quality financial institutions 
our trade receivables  which are unsecured  are geographically dispersed  and no single customer accounts for greater than of consolidated revenue or accounts receivable  net 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
the allowance for non collection of accounts receivable is based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
we place our cash and cash equivalents primarily in commercial bank accounts in the us account balances generally exceed federally insured limits 
foreign currency translation and transactions our functional currency is the us dollar 
for those subsidiaries not using the us dollar as their functional currency  assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the applicable balance sheet date and income and expense transactions are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of shareholders equity and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
our foreign exchange transaction gains losses are generally included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  now known as fasb asc 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  and tax contingencies 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we are subject to audits by various taxing authorities  and these audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution results in us owing additional taxes 
we are required to establish reserves under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  now known as fasb asc  when we believe there is uncertainty with respect to certain positions and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we believe that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under relevant tax law 
we have evaluated our tax positions for items of uncertainty in accordance with fasb asc and have determined that our tax positions are highly certain within the meaning of fasb asc we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
accordingly  no adjustments have been made to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and deferred taxes our current and deferred income taxes  and associated valuation allowances  are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as by both special and non recurring items 
assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax on income and deductions 
actual realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances 
the assessment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is based on the likelihood that a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
the weight of all available evidence is considered in determining realizability of our deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities are first applied to the deferred tax assets reducing the need for a valuation allowance 
we do not believe that sufficient evidence exists to release the balance of the valuation allowance as of december  as part of our evaluation of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a tax benefit of million at december  relating to the reduction of certain valuation allowances established in the uk as part of our evaluation of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a tax benefit of million at december  relating to the reduction of certain valuation allowances previously established in the us and the uk we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce or eliminate tax payments in future periods 
this reduction in valuation allowances had the effect of increasing net income by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our evaluations encompassed i reviews of our recent history of profitability in the us and the us for the past three years  and ii reviews of internal financial forecasts demonstrating our expected capacity to utilize deferred tax assets 
we review our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis as part of our fasb asc review 
significant and continuous judgment of management is required in determining the provision for income tax  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and related valuation allowances established against the deferred tax assets 
it is possible that the valuation allowances could be further adjusted  as necessary 
stock based compensation on september   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas no 
 now known as fasb asc 
sfas no 
amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
 also now known as fasb asc  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value of each stock based compensation award is estimated at the date of grant  using the black scholes option pricing model for stock option awards 
we did not have a historical basis for determining the volatility and expected life assumptions in the model due to our limited market trading history  therefore  the assumptions used for these amounts are an average of those used by a select group of related industry companies 
most stock based awards have graded vesting ie portions of the award vest at different dates during the vesting period 
we recognize the related stock based compensation expense of such awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period for each tranche in an award 
upon consummation of our plan of reorganization  all then outstanding stock options were cancelled 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  now known as fasb asc  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based awards granted to employees to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period  based on fair value of the award 
the fair value method under sfas no 
r is similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
with respect to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation expense except that sfas no 
r requires an estimate of future forfeitures  whereas sfas no 
permitted companies to estimate forfeitures or recognize the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
as we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred under sfas no 
 the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in a change in our accounting treatment  but it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following are the assumptions used by the company to calculate the weighted average fair value of stock options granted years ended december  dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years weighted average fair value of options granted for a description of our stock based compensation programs  see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

throughout this document  unless otherwise noted  amounts discussed are consolidated amounts 
net income 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the primary reason for the decrease in net income was the million change from a net benefit for income taxes recognized in compared to the provision for income taxes of million total change of million 
revenue increased by million and costs to support that revenue growth also increased  costs of revenue increased by million  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million and depreciation and amortization increased by million 
additionally  other income  net  decreased by million 
revenue 
consolidated revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue from our us operations increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the principal reason for this increase was the continued growth in each of our metro  fiber infrastructure and wan services 
this continued growth in revenue for each of these services is attributable principally to revenue from service installations exceeding reductions in revenue from contract terminations and any contractual price reductions 
us revenue from metro services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   us revenue from fiber infrastructure services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and us revenue from wan services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in other revenue  which includes domestic contract termination revenue  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenue from our foreign operations  primarily in the uk  increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase was due to an increase in provisioning of services in the uk also contributing to this increase was million of contract termination revenue earned during the year ended december  there was no contract termination revenue earned in the uk during the year ended december  the translation rate of the british pound to the us dollar for each year was substantially the same 
costs of revenue 
consolidated costs of revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
consolidated costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   resulting in consolidated gross profit margin of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs of revenue for our us operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in the domestic costs of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable principally to i an increase of million in co location expenses  to support our ip network services and increase our presence in third party data centers  ii an increase of million in payroll related expenses  iii an increase of million for expenses associated with third party network costs  and iv an increase of million in installation costs 
additionally  the years ended december  and include a provision for impairment of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease of million for repairs and maintenance charges for our cable and transmission equipment  and ii the reversal of million for right of way expenses during the three months ended june  due to previously accrued right of way expenses as a result of favorable negotiations with the relevant jurisdiction 
the costs of revenue for our foreign operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily because of increases in third party network costs  co location expenses  repairs and maintenance charges  leased fiber costs and increases in payroll related expenses totaling million needed to support our provisioning of services  partially offset by a one time benefit from a reduction in certain business tax rates on fiber by the valuation office agency in the uk  which was effective retroactively back to  resulting in a million benefit in as previously described  the translation rate of the british pound to the us dollar for each year was substantially the same 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a

sg a for our us operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased primarily due to i an increase of million in domestic payroll and payroll related expenses from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  which is attributable to an increase in annual merit increases for domestic employees effectuated on march   an increase in sales commissions due to an increase in year over year sales and a sales incentive program in effect in the first quarter of  ii an increase of million in domestic non cash stock based compensation expense from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   iii an increase of million for professional fees  iv an increase of million in occupancy charges  v an increase of million in transaction and ad valorem taxes  and vi an increase of million in other operating expenses  primarily due to increases in computer software and maintenance of million and commissions paid to third party sales agents and related marketing expenses of million for the year ended december  sg a from our foreign operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a net reduction of million  or 
our foreign operations reported increases in payroll related expenses of million  professional fees of million and non cash stock based compensation expense of million 
however  these increases were more than offset by the reversal of a december  accrual for a vat tax obligation totaling million  which was settled during the fourth quarter of the year and a reduction in other operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
consolidated depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to i additions of property and equipment in the year ended december   and the full period effect of depreciation on property and equipment acquired during the year ended december  and ii the change reduction in estimated useful lives of certain property and equipment effectuated on october  and january  interest income 
interest income  substantially all of which was earned in the us  decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the decline in short term interest rates during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   partially offset by an increase in average balances available for investment during most of the year 
interest expense 
interest expense  substantially all of which was incurred in the us  includes interest expense on borrowed amounts under the secured credit facility  availability fees on the unused portion of the secured credit facility  the amortization of debt acquisition costs including upfront fees related to the secured credit facility  interest expense related to a capital lease obligation  interest accrued on certain tax liabilities  interest on the outstanding balance of the deferred fair value rent liabilities established at fresh start and interest accretion relating to asset retirement obligations 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the interest incurred on the balance of the delayed draw term loan outstanding in  which was funded on december  other income  net 
other income  net is composed primarily of income or expense from non recurring transactions and is not comparative from a trend perspective 
consolidated other income  net was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a reduction of million

provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  and recognized an additional deferred tax benefit of million associated with the reduction of valuation allowances previously established with respect to deferred tax assets in the uk  which resulted in a net tax provision for of million 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was calculated at our effective tax rate based upon our pre tax book income adjusted for permanent differences in both the us and the us  resulting in a tax provision of million  plus a provision for certain capital based state taxes of million 
at december   we recognized million of non cash tax benefits as a result of reducing certain valuation allowances previously established with respect to deferred tax assets in the us and the us we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce or eliminate tax payments in future periods 
our evaluation encompassed i a review of our recent history of profitability in the us and us for the past three years  and ii a review of internal financial forecasts demonstrating our expected capacity to utilize deferred tax assets 
additionally  based on our ability to fully absorb current book income with our deferred tax assets and our ability to carryback certain portions of these losses to and  we recorded a current federal benefit from income taxes of million in we also provided million for state income taxes in results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated results dollars in millions for the table set forth below years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue costs of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization  shown separately below  and including provisions for equipment impairment of and for the years ended december  and  respectively selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net income from continuing operations  before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes nm net income nm nm not meaningful we use the term consolidated below to describe the total results of our two geographic segments  the us and the us and others

net income 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the reasons for the increase in net income were increases in revenue of million  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  a change increase in other income expense  net  of million  which were partially offset by an increase in costs of revenue of million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million 
the most significant difference is the change between the net income tax benefit of million recorded for the year ended december  and the net income tax provision of million recorded for the year ended december  these changes are discussed more fully below 
revenue 
consolidated revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue from our us operations increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the principal reason for this increase was due to the continued growth in each of our metro  fiber infrastructure and wan services 
the continued growth in revenue for each of these services is attributable principally to revenue from service installations exceeding reductions in revenue from contract terminations and any contractual price decreases 
us revenue from metro services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   revenue from fiber infrastructure services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and revenue from wan services increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in other revenue  which includes contract termination revenue  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue from our foreign operations  primarily in the uk  increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase was due to the increase in revenue in local currency from the uk  which exceeded the decrease in the translation rate of british pounds to us dollars in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  costs of revenue 
consolidated costs of revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
consolidated costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   resulting in consolidated gross profit margin of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs of revenue for our us operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in the domestic costs of revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable principally to i an increase of million in co location expenses  to support our ip network services and increase our presence in third party data centers  ii an increase of million in payroll related expenses  primarily related to the increase in headcount in our network management  strategic initiatives and fiber operations  and iii an increase of million for expenses associated with third party network costs 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease of million in long haul expenses from levels  which included million incurred in with respect to temporarily needed leased capacity  ii a decrease of million in amounts rebilled to customers for equipment sales for which there was a corresponding decrease in related revenue  and iii a decrease of million for repairs and maintenance charges for our cable and transmission equipment 
additionally  the year ended december  includes a provision for equipment impairment relating to inventory of million  compared to a provision for equipment impairment relating to inventory of million and a lease abandonment cost of million for the year ended december  the costs of revenue for our foreign operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to increases in right of way  third party network costs  leased fiber costs and repairs and maintenance charges  which were needed to support the increases in our current and future operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
consolidated sg a for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
sg a as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  in the us  sg a was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
sg a for our us operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  decreased primarily due to a million decrease in professional fees due to the normalization of our financial reporting and a decrease of million in domestic non cash stock based compensation expense from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense were i the non cash compensation expense associated with the acceleration of the vesting of restricted stock units relating to the termination of mr 
doris employment contract  and ii the non cash compensation expense of associated with the modification of options to purchase common stock in connection with mr 
doris termination  both of which were incurred during the three months ended march  see note  employment contract termination  for a further discussion of mr 
doris employment contract 
we also had an impairment charge of million with respect to an asset abandonment during the year ended december  see note  property and equipment asset abandonment  for a further discussion 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in domestic payroll and payroll related expenses of million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in headcount and an increase in bonus accrual of million  partially offset by a decrease in severance expense of million 
in addition  transaction based taxes increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  sg a from our foreign operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
with respect to our foreign operations  local currency increases in payroll related expenses and a prior year adjustment for transaction taxes were far in excess of the reduction in professional fees in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net increase in local currency exceeded the reduction caused by the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
consolidated depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additions to property and equipment in and the full year effect of depreciation on property and equipment acquired throughout this increase was partially offset by the elimination of depreciation expense associated with property and equipment sold or disposed of during and and property and equipment that became fully depreciated during interest income 
interest income  substantially all of which was earned in the us  decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the decrease in short term interest rates in compared to  partially offset by an increase in average balances available for investment 
interest expense 
interest expense  substantially all of which was incurred in the us  includes interest expense on borrowed amounts under the secured credit facility  availability fees on the unused portion of the secured credit facility  the amortization of debt acquisition costs including upfront fees related to the secured credit facility  interest expense related to a capital lease obligation  interest accrued on certain tax liabilities  interest on the outstanding balance of the deferred fair value rent liabilities established at fresh start and interest accretion relating to asset retirement obligations 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase of million  or  was primarily due to the full year effect of interest on the million portion of the term loan borrowed on february  and the million portion of the term loan borrowed on october   partially offset by the quarterly scheduled repayments of principal of million on june  and september   which reduced the balance on which interest expense is incurred 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is composed primarily of income or expense from non recurring transactions and is not comparative from a trend perspective 
consolidated other income expense  net was net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net expense of million for the year ended december   a change of million

benefit from income taxes 
we recognized million of non cash tax benefits at december  as a result of reducing certain valuation allowances previously established with respect to deferred tax assets in the us and the us we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce or eliminate tax payments in future periods 
our evaluation encompassed i a review of our recent history of profitability in the us for the past three years  and ii a review of internal financial forecasts demonstrating our expected capacity to utilize deferred tax assets 
additionally  based on our ability to fully absorb current book income with our deferred tax assets and our ability to carryback certain portions of these losses to and  we recorded a current federal benefit from income taxes of million 
we also provided million for state income taxes in liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital deficit of million at december   compared to working capital of million at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in unrestricted cash of million from million at december  to million at december  because of the payment of the special cash dividend on december  of million  the use of cash to purchase property and equipment of million and the scheduled debt service payments totaling million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million and cash generated by the exercise of stock purchase warrants  options to purchase shares of common stock and shares sold to employees under our employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
working capital was also affected by increases to i accounts receivable of million  ii accrued expenses of million  and iii prepaid costs and other current assets of million  partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  represents net income  plus the add back to net income of non cash items deducted in the determination of net income  principally depreciation and amortization of million  the change in deferred tax assets of million and non cash stock based compensation expense of million  plus the changes in working capital components 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from the add back of non cash items deducted in the determination of net income  principally depreciation and amortization of million  non cash stock based compensation expense of million and provisions for equipment impairment of million to net income plus the changes in working capital components 
the year over year increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the increase in net income adjusted for non cash activities depreciation and amortization  change in deferred tax assets and non cash stock based compensation expense offset by the difference in the changes in working capital components  the most significant one of which was deferred revenue  a significant source of cash from operating activities in the period 
in  cash received for installation payments  which are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period  exceeded amortization of deferred revenue 
in  because the average customer orders were smaller than in prior years  emphasis on installation payments decreased  which resulted in amortization of deferred revenue exceeding cash collections of installation payments 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   an increase of million 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of million  offset by the proceeds generated from sales of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was attributable to the purchases of property and equipment of million  offset by the proceeds generated from sales of property and equipment of million 
the increase in capital expenditures in compared to was attributable to the measured growth strategy implemented in and high dollar volume of orders  which resulted in higher capital expenditures needed to provide the service 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the year ended december   which is comprised of the special cash dividend of per common share totaling million  principal payments under the secured credit facility of million and the purchase of treasury stock of million  offset by the proceeds from the exercise of warrants of million and the proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase shares of common stock and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   which is comprised of the million of net proceeds received from the funding of the delayed draw term loan under the secured credit facility  the proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase shares of common stock of million and the proceeds from the exercise of warrants of million  offset by the principal payment under the secured credit facility of million  the principal payment on our capital lease obligation of million  the purchase of treasury stock of million and the increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
on february   we excluding certain foreign subsidiaries entered into the secured credit facility comprised of i an million revolver  ii a million term loan and iii an million delayed draw term loan 
the secured credit facility was scheduled to mature on the fifth anniversary of the closing date february  
the secured credit facility was secured by substantially all of our domestic assets 
on september   we executed a joinder agreement to the secured credit facility that added an additional lender and increased the amount of the secured credit facility to million effective october   the revolver increased to million  the term loan increased to million and the available delayed draw term loan increased to million 
at december   the outstanding balance was million 
in connection with the special cash dividend  in november  we obtained a commitment for a million secured revolving credit facility 
the million secured revolving credit facility closed on january  we drew down million at closing  of which million was used to repay the outstanding secured credit facility including accrued interest  million was used to pay bank fees and related expenses associated with the million secured revolving credit facility and the balance was used for general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities that was sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt service and expenditures for property and equipment 
as discussed above  we paid a special cash dividend in december totaling million  which reduced liquidity 
in january  we repaid our secured credit facility  comprised of term loans with million outstanding and closed the million secured revolving credit facility 
the new facility provides us with the flexibility and capability to fund operations  as required 
we expect that our cash from operations will continue to exceed our operating expenses and plan to continue to use  as needed  our net cash from operations  cash reserves and the million secured revolving credit facility to fund our operating expenses and future capital projects 
we  from time to time  commit capital for  among other things  i customer capital to connect customers to the network  ii expansion and improvement of infrastructure  and iii equipment

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk
