goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing 
based on a combination of factors  including the influence of prolonged macro economic conditions on the lawn and garden market in the us and the operating results of the power products segment which lacked the benefit of certain weather related events that are favorable to the business during the past two years  the company s forecasted cash flow estimates used in the goodwill assessment were adversely impacted 
as a result  the company concluded that the carrying value of the power products reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  which was 
table of contents determined by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
this impairment charge is a non cash expense that did not adversely affect the company s debt position  cash flow  liquidity or compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities 
no impairment charges were recorded within the engines segment 
interest expense interest expense was million lower for fiscal due to lower average outstanding borrowings and the reduced interest rate associated with the senior notes due that were issued in december  partially offset by million of pre tax charges related to the redemption premium on the senior notes and the write off of related deferred financing costs

approximately million of the goodwill impairment was related to non deductible goodwill associated with past stock acquisitions for which a tax benefit was not recorded 
the remaining goodwill impairment generated the million of tax benefit 
due to the significant impact the impairment charge had on the effective tax rate  the company believes the tax benefit and the effective tax rate excluding the million impairment charge are more meaningful comparisons to last year s comparable period 
excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge  the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the annual fluctuations reflect the impact of changes in foreign earnings at different tax rates  the taxation of dividends from foreign operations as well as the resolution of certain tax matters 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consolidated net sales were approximately billion  a decrease of million compared to the previous year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced generator shipment volumes due to the absence of landed hurricanes as well as lower average prices for engines 
engines segment net sales in fiscal were billion compared to billion in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
total engine volumes for the year were essentially flat as an increase in engines used in lawn and garden applications was offset by reduced demand for engines for portable generators due to no landed hurricane activity

the amended credit agreement revolver provides a revolving credit facility for up to million in revolving loans  including up to million in swing line loans 
the company used proceeds from the revolver to pay off the remaining amounts outstanding under the company s variable rate term notes issued in february with various financial institutions  retire the senior notes that were due in september and fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
the revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the revolver are due and payable on july  as of july  and june   there were no borrowings on the revolver 
in april  the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the common stock of the company  which was payable june  to shareholders of record at the close of business june  this quarterly dividend was reduced from the prior quarter s level 
the reduced dividend is more comparable with the company s historical payout ratio of of net income and dividend yield of 
in addition  a reduced dividend preserves cash in light of the continuing uncertainty in the credit markets 
this action  along with other cash preserving initiatives  should reduce the company s need for additional borrowings for working capital in the near to medium term future 
on august   the board of directors of briggs stratton authorized up to million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an expiration of june  briggs stratton will repurchase shares of common stock  using available cash  on the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants 

table of contents briggs stratton expects capital expenditures to be approximately to million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in efficient equipment and innovative new products 
the company is required to make contributions of approximately million to the qualified pension plan during fiscal the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending upon the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
management believes that available cash  cash generated from operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver and the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase shares  incur indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge with other entities  sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of sales of its assets 
the revolver contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose a maximum leverage ratio 
as of july   the company was in compliance with these covenants  and expects to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or share repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements briggs stratton has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
briggs stratton s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations consulting and employment agreements other liabilities a a includes an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
any further funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit plans beyond fiscal cannot be estimated at this time 
because their future cash outflows are uncertain  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and other sundry items are excluded from the table above 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and 
table of contents assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes made to the company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized 
the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the company s reporting units to their estimated fair values as of the test dates 
the company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its reportable segments 
the estimates of fair value of the reporting units are computed using a combination of an income and market approach 
the income approach utilizes a multi year forecast of estimated cash flows and a terminal value at the end of the cash flow period 
the forecast period assumptions consist of internal projections that are based on the company s budget and long range strategic plan 
the discount rate used at the test date is the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
under the market approach  the fair value of reporting unit is estimated based on market multiples of cash flow for comparable companies and similar transactions 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units is reconciled to the company s current market capitalization based upon the company s trailing day average stock price plus an estimated control premium 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not deemed impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of its existing tangible assets and liabilities as well as existing identified intangible assets and previously unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the unallocated portion of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company performed the annual impairment test on its engines and power products reporting units as of july  the fair value assessment of the engines reporting unit indicated its goodwill balance was not impaired as the reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value 
however  the impairment analysis determined that the power products reporting units had goodwill balances that were impaired 
therefore  the company recognized a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of the assumptions included in the impairment test require judgment  and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculation 
other than management s internal projections of future cash flows  the primary assumptions used in the impairment test were the weighted average cost of capital  long term growth rates and the control premium 
trademarks are not amortized 
if impairment occurs  the impaired amount of the trademark is written off immediately 
for purposes of the trademark impairment analysis  the company performs its assessment of fair value based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
the company determines the fair value of each trademark by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted cost of capital 
the company believes the relief from royalty method to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets 
sales growth rates are determined after considering current and 
table of contents future economic conditions  recent sales trends  discussions with customers  planned timing of new product launches and many other variables 
each royalty rate is based on profitability of the business to which it relates and observed market royalty rates 
the methods of assessing fair value for goodwill and trademark impairment purposes require significant judgments to be made by management 
although the company s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to these businesses 
the growth rates and gross profit margins used for the terminal value calculations and the discount rates of the respective reporting units as of july  were as follows terminal growth rate terminal gross profit margin discount rate engines power products changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
assuming no other change in assumptions  a decrease of in the company s terminal sales growth rate would increase the power products segment goodwill impairment charge by approximately million  a decrease of in the company s terminal gross profit margin would increase the power products segment goodwill impairment charge by approximately million  and an increase of in the company s discount rate would increase the power products segment goodwill impairment charge by approximately million 
definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and patents 
these definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
income taxes the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  tax contingencies and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
pension and other postretirement plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance  which is essential in the current volatile market 
actuarial valuations at july  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets  knowing that our investment performance has been in the top decile compared to other plans 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits 
table of contents expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
at july  the fair value of plan assets was less than the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the company is required to make minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan of million in fiscal the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending on the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with us gaap 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other reserves the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  it requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
asu will be effective for public companies for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
management does not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in may   the fasb issued asu fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the asu is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb to develop a single  converged fair value framework 
while the asu is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
key additional disclosures include quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs in level measures  qualitative information about sensitivity of level measures and valuation process  and classification within the fair value hierarchy for instruments where fair value is only disclosed in the footnotes but carrying amount is on some other basis 
for public companies  the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  management does not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance that changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie and requires companies to more frequently assess whether they must consolidate vies 
this standard was effective for the company s first quarter of fiscal as of june  and subsequently  the company evaluated all entities that fall within the scope of this new guidance  including the company s investments in joint ventures  to determine whether consolidation of these entities was required 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
other matters labor agreement briggs stratton has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire at various times ranging from calendar years 
table of contents emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed multiple phases of national emission standards for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering that complies with the epa s phase ii engine emission standards 
the epa issued proposed phase iii standards in to further reduce engine exhaust emissions and to control evaporative emissions from small off road engines and equipment in which they are used 
the phase iii standards are similar to those adopted by the california air resources board carb 
the phase iii program requires evaporative controls in and go into full effect in for class ii engines cubic centimeter displacement and larger and for class i engines less than cubic centimeter displacement 
while briggs stratton believes the cost of the regulation may increase engine and equipment costs per unit  briggs stratton does not believe the cost of compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
carb s tier regulation requires additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the tier regulation was fully phased in during fiscal year while briggs stratton believes the cost of the regulation may increase engine and equipment costs per unit  briggs stratton does not believe the regulation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
this assessment is based on a number of factors  including revisions the carb made to its adopted regulation from the proposal published in september in response to recommendations from briggs stratton and others in the regulated category and intention to pass increased costs associated with the regulation on to consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from small air cooled engines 
the directive parallels the phase i and ii regulations adopted by the us epa 
stage was effective in february and stage was phased in between calendar years and  with some limited extensions available for specific size and type engines until briggs stratton has a full product line compliant with stage briggs stratton does not believe the cost of compliance with the directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the republic of china has implemented emissions standards for small engines with a compliance date of march the regulations are based on the eu stage regulations  so briggs stratton expects to have engines available for sale in china as needed when the regulations are in effect
