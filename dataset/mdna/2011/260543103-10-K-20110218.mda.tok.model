table of contents outlook for in  dow and the chemical industry as a whole experienced another year of improving economic conditions 
economies across much of the developed world showed signs of ongoing recovery in most end markets as the year progressed 
meanwhile  the emerging geographies continued to lead in economic growth and  as a result  were a critical area of focus for new business opportunities and investments 
as the year came to a close  however  some challenges remained  such as high unemployment in developed geographies and weakness in construction end markets  particularly in the united states and europe 
in the face of these challenges  dow delivered a reshaped and transformed business portfolio in one that is increasingly targeted to growing geographic areas and end markets  and well balanced to mitigate uncertainties 
furthermore  the company continued to emphasize its commitment to financial discipline  completing capital market transactions and divesting non core assets to reduce financial expense and strengthen its balance sheet 
looking to  dow expects growth in the emerging geographies to continue  driven by a broad range of leading end markets 
the company projects that these geographic areas will continue their high rate of growth  although year over year comparisons will be subdued relative to recent years 
signs of improvement in industrial end markets in north america and europe  coupled with ongoing strength in higher growth sectors such as electronics  agriculture and packaging  give dow greater optimism that growth will continue in the developed geographies 
despite these more favorable business conditions  the company expects lingering challenges to remain  particularly slow employment growth in developed geographies 
furthermore  amid an environment of improving economic conditions  dow expects feedstock and energy costs to remain at elevated levels  and volatility in these costs to continue 
within the chemical industry  the growing supply of natural gas liquids is expected to continue to benefit the competitiveness of us chemical assets 
meanwhile  the start up of new ethylene capacity outside of the united states and europe remains a challenge to supply fundamentals across the ethylene chain and could put downward pressure on the profitability of higher cost production assets within the industry 
the company will continue to implement its strategic transformation while remaining focused on strengthening its balance sheet and preferentially investing in its performance businesses and in emerging geographies 
the company s plans do not assume an accelerated rebound in business conditions 
rather  dow s success will continue to be driven by its transformed business portfolio  balanced geographic presence  and continued investments in innovations aimed at the intersection of greatest societal need and business opportunity 
the company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in capital spending is expected to increase approximately million from levels 
research and development spending is projected to remain at approximately the same level as equity in earnings of dow s nonconsolidated affiliates is expected to improve above pre recession levels  driven by robust fundamentals at the company s principal joint ventures  particularly dow corning  equate and the kuwait olefins company ksc other matters recent accounting guidance see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting guidance

however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded

in cases where an indication of impairment is determined to exist  the company completes an interim goodwill impairment test specifically for that reporting unit 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units 
this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the company s reporting units 
however  where market comparables are available  the company includes ebit ebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis 
the discounted cash flow valuations are completed with the use of key assumptions  including projected revenue growth rate  discount rate  tax rate  currency exchange rates  terminal value  and long term hydrocarbons and energy prices 
these key assumptions are reevaluated with each annual impairment test and updated based on current facts and circumstances 
currency exchange rates  and long term hydrocarbons and energy prices are established for the company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units  while tax rates  revenue growth rates  terminal values calculated using the key value driver implementation of the gordon growth model  and discount rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk 
for the annual impairment test  currency exchange rates were projected by year for currencies  and long term hydrocarbons and energy prices were forecast by geographic area by year and included all key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to the correlation to naphtha 
tax rates varied by reporting unit with the average rate being percent 
discount rates ranged from percent to percent based on an assessment of likely market participants and relative industry risk of each reporting unit 
terminal values were differentiated based on the cash flow projections of each reporting unit and the projected net operating profit after tax nopat growth rate  which ranged from negative percent to positive percent 
revenue growth rates  or compounded annual growth rates cagr over a ten year cash flow forecast period  varied by reporting unit based on underlying business fundamentals and future expectations with rates ranging from percent to percent 
changes in key assumptions can affect the results of goodwill impairment tests 
the changes made to key assumptions in did not result in a significant change in the impairment analysis conclusion 
the key assumptions with the most significant impact on reporting unit fair value calculations include the discount rate and terminal value nopat growth rate 
for the impairment test  management completed sensitivity analyses on both of these key assumptions 
an increase of basis points in the discount rate would have resulted in a fair value  based on discounted cash flows  which exceeded the carrying value for all of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill 
for the terminal value nopat growth rate  a decrease of basis points would have resulted in a fair value  based on discounted cash flows  which exceeded the carrying value for all of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill 
additional sensitivity analysis was completed on the combined impact of a basis point increase in the discount rate and a basis point decrease in the terminal value nopat growth rate 
this analysis resulted in fair values  based on discounted cash flows  that exceeded carrying values for all reporting units that carry goodwill 

table of contents in completing the annual impairment test for  management evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit 
all differences were determined to be reasonable 
based on the fair value analysis completed by the company in the fourth quarter of  using the key assumptions defined for the company as well as the key assumptions defined specifically for each reporting unit  management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units that carry goodwill 
the same analysis was completed by the company in the fourth quarter of and management concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units that carry goodwill except the dow haltermann reporting unit 
as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  which represented the total amount of goodwill carried by the dow haltermann reporting unit 
due to the conclusion that the goodwill associated with the dow haltermann reporting unit was impaired  management also initiated a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit to assess whether or not any additional asset impairment existed 
based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis completed in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  no further impairment existed 
the company also monitors and evaluates its market capitalization relative to book value 
when the market capitalization of the company falls below book value  management undertakes a process to evaluate whether a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units has declined below carrying value 
this evaluation process includes the use of third party market based valuations and internal discounted cash flow analysis 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  the company also compares market capitalization with the total estimated fair value of its reporting units to ensure that significant differences are understood 
at december  and december   dow s market capitalization exceeded book value 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note q to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the us pension plans represent approximately percent of the company s pension plan assets and percent of the pension obligations 
the following information relates to the us plans only  a similar approach is used for the company s non us plans 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the board of directors and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered 
the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience 
the expected long term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year 
the weighted average long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption was unchanged for determining net periodic pension expense 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us qualified plans are based on the yield on high quality fixed income instruments at the measurement date 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of dow s major us plans are matched against the towers watson rate link yield curve based on th to th percentile bond yields to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
the weighted average discount rate was percent at december  and percent at december  
table of contents at december   the us qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by billion 
the underfunded amount increased by approximately million compared with december  the increase was primarily due to lower discount rates partially offset by favorable plan asset returns and contributions during the year 
the company contributed million to the us qualified plans in the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the principal us qualified plans was percent 
since  the company has used a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 
the following discussion relates to all of the company s pension plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
at december   net losses of million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market related value of assets and are a component of the total net loss of  million for shown under pretax amounts recognized in aoci at december in the table entitled change in projected benefit obligations  plan assets and funded status of all significant plans included in note q to the consolidated financial statements 
the other  million of net losses represents cumulative changes in plan experience and actuarial assumptions 
the net decrease or increase in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains and losses is presented in the following table net decrease increase in market related asset value due to recognition of prior gains and losses in millions total based on the pension assumptions and the changes in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior asset losses  the company expects net periodic benefit costs to increase by approximately million for all pension and other postretirement benefits in compared with a basis point increase or decrease in the long term return on assets assumption would change the company s total pension expense for by approximately million 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would change the company s total pension expense for by approximately million 
a basis point change in the long term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  both positive and negative  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of  million  after valuation allowances of million 

table of contents in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  the company relies on  in order of increasing subjectivity  taxable income in prior carryback years  the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of  million  million of which is subject to expiration in the years in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  the company needs taxable income of approximately  million across multiple jurisdictions 
the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between is approximately million 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
at december   the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of million 
the company accrues for non income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
at december   the company had a non income tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of million

chemical security public and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 
many  including dow and the american chemistry council  have called for uniform risk based and performance based national standards for securing the us chemical industry 
the maritime transportation security act mtsa of and its regulations further set forth risk based and performance based standards that must be met at us coast guard regulated facilities 
us chemical plant security legislation was passed in and the department of homeland security dhs is now implementing the regulations known as the chemical facility anti terrorism standards 
the company is complying with the requirements of the rail transportation security rule issued by the us transportation security administration tsa 
dow continues to support uniform risk based national standards for securing the chemical industry 
the focus on security is not new to dow 
a comprehensive  multi level security plan for the company has been maintained since this plan  which has been activated in response to significant world and national events since then  is reviewed on an annual basis 
dow continues to improve its security plans  placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks 
the security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments  security audits  mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability 
dow s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business work operations that could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
dow played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council s responsible care security code  which requires that all aspects of security including facility  transportation and cyberspace be assessed and gaps addressed 
through the company s global implementation of the security code  dow has permanently heightened the level of security not just in the united states  but worldwide 
dow employs several hundred employees and contractors in its emergency services and security department worldwide 
through the implementation of the security code  including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades made since  dow is well positioned to comply with the new us chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks 
in addition  dow was the first chemical company to receive coverage under the support anti terrorism by fostering effective technologies act safety act from the dhs in for the company s mtsa regulated sites  and the first to receive coverage under safety act in for the company s rail transportation security services 
this unprecedented certification helps validate dow s efforts and provides additional liability coverage in the event of a terrorist attack 
dow continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on responsible care  supply chain design  emergency preparedness  shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials 
dow is cooperating with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design  and track and trace technologies 
further  dow s distribution risk review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company s supply chain 
to reduce vulnerabilities  dow maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which the company operates 
dow continually works to strengthen partnerships with local responders  law enforcement and security agencies  and to enhance confidence in the integrity of the company s security and risk management program  as well as strengthen its preparedness and response capabilities 
dow also works closely with its supply chain partners and strives to educate lawmakers  regulators and communities about the company s resolve and actions to date that mitigate security and crisis threats 

table of contents climate change dow is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas ghg intensity pounds of ghg per pound of product  developing climate friendly products and processes and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced its absolute ghg emissions by more than percent  a more rapid reduction than required by kyoto protocol targets 
since  dow has achieved a percent improvement in energy intensity the amount of energy required to produce one pound of product 
in doing so  it has avoided consuming more than  trillion btus  a savings that when converted to electricity would more than supply the residential electrical energy needs of california for one year 
through its energy savings  dow has prevented approximately million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere 
this trend could change  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
dow  through its science and technology capabilities  is committed to bringing solutions to the challenge of climate change by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
for example  dow s building insulation materials and air sealing products can save up to percent on heating and cooling costs and significantly reduce ghg emissions 
the company s styrofoam insulation is installed in over million buildings worldwide  saving over billion in energy costs annually 
dow s dowtherm a heat transfer fluids are used in large concentrating solar power plants  with a total capacity of over megawatts 
these plants will provide power for the equivalent of approximately  homes and save million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year 
gains made toward dow s energy efficiency goal will directly impact progress in reducing ghg intensity 
dow is studying the life cycle impact of its products on climate change and additional global projects that could offset the company s overall ghg emissions through carbon dioxide reduction 
although the company has some units subject to the european union s emissions trading scheme eu ets  the company has not experienced any considerable impact in regard to regulated ghg emissions from the eu ets 
dow will continue to evaluate and monitor future developments that may affect operations in the region 
dow s energy climate change policy and issue management team is tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the challenges of climate change and energy security and is advocating an international framework that establishes clear pathways to help slow  stop and reverse the rate of ghg emissions globally 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and emerging remediation technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
at december   the liability related to remediation was million 
in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites was million at december  million at december  
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 

table of contents information regarding environmental sites is provided below environmental sites dow owned sites superfund sites number of sites at january sites acquired from rohm and haas sites added during year sites closed during year number of sites at december dow owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed in the united states by the resource conservation recovery act or analogous state law

dow sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in superfund sites are sites  including sites not owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 
additional information is provided below for the company s manufacturing sites in freeport  texas  midland  michigan  and philadelphia  pennsylvania  the sites for which the company has the largest environmental remediation accruals  as well as a superfund site in wood ridge  new jersey 
from the start of operations at the freeport site in the s until the mid s  manufacturing wastes were typically placed in on site pits and landfills 
the resulting soil and groundwater contamination is being assessed and remediated under the provisions of the resource conservation recovery act rcra  in concert with the state of texas 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  related to environmental remediation at the freeport manufacturing site 
in  million million in was spent on environmental remediation at the freeport site 
similar to the freeport site  in the early days of operations at the midland site  manufacturing wastes were usually disposed of on site  resulting in soil and groundwater contamination  which has been contained and managed on site under a series of rcra permits and regulatory agreements 
the most recent hazardous waste operating license for the midland site  issued in  also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off site contamination from historic midland site operations 
the scope of the investigation includes midland area soils  the tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay  and requires the company to conduct interim response actions 
in january  the company entered into a federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act administrative order on consent to perform a remedial investigation  feasibility study and remedial design for the tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay

at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  for environmental remediation at the two wood ridge sites 
in  the company spent million million in  following the april  acquisition on environmental remediation at the two wood ridge sites 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately twice that amount 
consequently  it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
it is the opinion of the company s management  however  that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the company s current pollution abatement facilities totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation introduction union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation and the prospects of various forms of state and national legislative reform  the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in  and the first half of since then  the rate of filing has significantly abated 
union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future  and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
the table below provides information regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem claims unresolved at january claims filed claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved claims unresolved at december claimants with claims against both ucc and amchem individual claimants at december plaintiffs lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants 
as a result  the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide  amchem or any other particular defendant  even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury 
in fact  there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide and or amchem are the sole named defendants 
for these reasons and based upon union carbide s litigation and settlement experience  union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos related liability 

table of contents estimating the liability based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
since then  union carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent arpc study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in addition  union carbide has requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity each november since to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent arpc study 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its then most recent study completed in december in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between million and billion 
as in its earlier studies  arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time in its december study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
in december  based on arpc s december study and union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide decreased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims to million  which covered the year period ending  excluding future defense and processing costs 
the reduction was million and is shown as asbestos related credits in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was million 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its december study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  in december  arpc stated that an update of its study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remained applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was million

at december    the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was million 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 

table of contents defense and resolution costs the following table provides information regarding defense and resolution costs related to asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem defense and resolution costs aggregate costs in millions to date as of dec 
 defense costs resolution costs the average resolution payment per asbestos claimant and the rate of new claim filings has fluctuated both up and down since the beginning of union carbide s management expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon a number of factors  including the number and type of claims settled in a particular period  the jurisdictions in which such claims arose  and the extent to which any proposed legislative reform related to asbestos litigation is being considered 
union carbide expenses defense costs as incurred 
the pretax impact for defense and resolution costs  net of insurance  was million in  million in and million in  and was reflected in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
insurance receivables at december   union carbide increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion  substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
the wellington agreement and other agreements with insurers are designed to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of union carbide s insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
in september  union carbide filed a comprehensive insurance coverage case  now proceeding in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  seeking to confirm its rights to insurance for various asbestos claims and to facilitate an orderly and timely collection of insurance proceeds the insurance litigation 
the insurance litigation was filed against insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place with union carbide regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage  in order to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of such insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
since the filing of the case  union carbide has reached settlements with several of the carriers involved in the insurance litigation  including settlements reached with two significant carriers in the fourth quarter of the insurance litigation is ongoing 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  at december  and december   all of the receivable for insurance recoveries was related to insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage 
in addition to the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability  union carbide had receivables for defense and resolution costs submitted to insurance carriers that have settlement agreements in place regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage 
the following table summarizes union carbide s receivables related to its asbestos related liability receivables for asbestos related costs at december in millions receivables for defense costs carriers with settlement agreements receivables for resolution costs carriers with settlement agreements receivables for insurance recoveries carriers without settlement agreements total 
table of contents after a review of its insurance policies  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  after taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers  existing insurance settlements  and the advice of outside counsel with respect to the applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of its insurance policies  union carbide continues to believe that its recorded receivable for insurance recoveries from all insurance carriers is probable of collection 
summary the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities  where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
exposures primarily relate to assets  liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies  as well as economic exposure  which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities 
the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies  the japanese yen and the canadian dollar  although exposures also exist in other currencies of asia pacific  latin america  and india  middle east and africa 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
feedstocks for ethylene production and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
the var methodology used by the company is a historical simulation model which captures co movements in market rates across different instruments and market risk exposure categories 
the historical simulation model uses a percent confidence level and the historical scenario period includes at least six months of historical data 
the and year end and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below 
these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the company total daily var at december in millions year end average year end average foreign exchange interest rate equities commodities composite the company s daily var for the aggregate of all positions decreased slightly from a composite var of million at december  to a composite of million at december  see note j to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk
