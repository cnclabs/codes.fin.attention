business overview our sales were higher and our business was more profitable for fiscal year than in the same period a year ago 
the increase in sales and profit was largely due to acquisitions completed in fiscal year and warmer than normal weather during the spring and summer in our market area 
warmer weather resulted in higher water sales which have a higher margin 
from a non operating perspective  we received a one time legal settlement of million  compared to a similar million settlement in  which favorably impacted our financial results in the year 
despite uncertainty in the regional economy  our business remains healthy 
we continue to have adequate cash on hand while reducing debt 
on april  we consummated an amendment to restructure our term loan repayment and renew our line of credit 
we continue to have borrowing capacity available on our new line of credit 
we also are continuing to explore ways to leverage our distribution channels and operate our business more efficiently and evaluate acquisition scenarios as they arise 
in fiscal  we announced a plan to sell office supplies in the future 
accordingly  these activities may require us to use more cash and increase debt to take advantage of future sales growth and profit margin opportunities 
results of operations fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  sales sales for fiscal year were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
sales attributable to acquisitions in fiscal year were  net of the acquisitions  sales increased 
the comparative breakdown of sales is as follows product line in s in s difference in s diff 
water coffee and related equipment rental other total water the aggregate increase in water sales was a result of a increase in price and a increase in volume 
the increase in price was attributable to general increases in list prices 
the increase in the amount of water sold was attributable to an acquisition completed in april and to warmer than normal weather in the company s market area during the third quarter of sales increased as a result of acquisitions so  net of acquisitions  total water sales increased in fiscal year coffee and related products the decrease in sales was primarily due to a decline of traditional coffee and ancillary refreshment products combined sales  despite growth in sales of single serve coffee 
the largest decrease was in traditional coffee sales which declined as a result of economic conditions and greater competition 
single serve coffee sales increased to  in from  in acquisitions did not materially affect this category in equipment rental equipment rental revenue increased slightly  but was substantially unchanged  in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
equipment placements decreased while the average rental price increased 
acquisitions increased equipment rental revenue in fiscal year compared to other the increase in other revenue is attributable to higher sales of other products  which increased  most notably water in single serve containers and cups 
the increase also reflects an increase in fuel adjustment fees that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations as a result of higher fuel prices 
fuel adjustment charges increased in the from gross profit cost of goods sold gross profit increased  or  in fiscal year compared to  to  from  as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to of sales from for the respective periods 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to changes in product sales mix including an increase in higher margin water sales and an increase in fuel adjustment charges that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations 
cost of goods sold includes all costs to bottle water  costs of purchasing and receiving products for resale  including freight  as well as costs associated with product quality  warehousing and handling costs  internal transfers  and the repair and service of rental equipment  but does not include the costs of distributing our product to our customers 
we include distribution costs in selling  general  and administrative expense  and the amount is reported below 
other companies may include distribution costs in their cost of goods sold  in which case  on a comparative basis  such other companies may have a lower gross margin as a result 
income from operations operating expenses income from operations was  in compared to  in  an increase of  total operating expenses decreased to  for the year  from  the prior year  a decrease of  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in fiscal year and  in  a decrease of  or 
of total sg a expenses route sales costs decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily related to lower labor costs on commission based sales due to increased route efficiency 
included as a component of route sales costs are total direct distribution related costs which decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of lower labor costs  selling costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year as a result of higher sales related compensation and computer support costs and  administrative costs decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  as a result of lower labor costs  professional fees related to compliance and litigation 
advertising expenses increased to  in fiscal year from  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in advertising costs is primarily related to an increase in agency costs and internet advertising 
amortization decreased  to  in fiscal year from  in amortization is attributable to intangible assets that were acquired as part of acquisitions in recent years 
we had a loss from the sale of miscellaneous assets in fiscal year of  compared to a loss on the sale of assets of  in fiscal year these were sales of miscellaneous assets no longer used in the course of business 
we conducted an assessment of goodwill as of october  and the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different market approaches quoted stock price  value comparisons to publicly traded companies see note believed to have comparable reporting units  and discounted net cash flow 
these approaches provide a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and takes into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
we used a weighted average of the three different market approaches as shown below percentages for weighted average quoted stock price value comparisons to publicly traded companies discounted net cash flow the weightings remained very similar from year to year 
the quoted stock price method was decreased slightly because of the lower volume  a limited number of outstanding shares changed hands  and price on the market which encourages speculation 
the comparison method increased slightly because the quality of the comparisons increased somewhat though none are ideal 
the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to its equity value 
the assessments concluded that the company s fair value exceeded the company s equity  therefore goodwill was not impaired as of the respective valuation dates 
since step one indicated no impairment  step two was not necessary 
if impairment had been indicated  we would have then allocated the estimated fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the company including unrecognized intangible assets as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
we then would have recognized impairment in the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value of goodwill as determined in this allocation 
other income and expense  income taxes  and income from operations interest expense was  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year  a decrease of  the decrease is attributable to lower outstanding debt  on average  and lower variable interest rates

tax expense for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year and resulted in an effective tax rate of in and in the increase in the effective tax rate from to was primarily a result of the difference in book to tax adjustments 
our total effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state rates for the states in which we operate 
net income net income in fiscal year was  compared to net income of  in  an increase of  the increase was primarily attributable to higher income from operations and non operating legal settlement  net of a higher tax provision 
net income was completely attributable to continuing operations 
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding of  basic and diluted  income per share in fiscal year was

this was an increase of

the fair value of our interest rate hedge swap agreements decreased  during fiscal year compared to a decrease of  in this resulted in unrealized losses of  and  net of reclassification adjustments and taxes  respectively  for the fiscal years ended october  and the decrease during the year has been recognized as an adjustment to net income to arrive at comprehensive income as defined by the applicable accounting standards 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had working capital of  compared to  as of october   an increase of  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to the increase in net income in fiscal year  which benefited from the legal settlement noted above 
net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly by  to  in from  in in  we received a significant tax refund that increased cash provided from operating activities 
we did not have a similar refund in we use cash provided by operations to repay debt and fund capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we used  for repayment of debt 
although our scheduled payments of senior debt decreased in  we paid  more than because of a  one time payment 
we repaid  on our subordinated debt in each year 
we also used  more for capital expenditures in than in we spent more on water bottles and coolers as well as computers and software in compared to in addition  we completed smaller acquisitions in resulting in  less cash used than in in  we funded cash usage from operations and did not borrow additional funds 
we amended our credit agreement the new agreement with bank of america to provide a senior financing facility consisting of term debt and a revolving line of credit 
the new agreement has a total loan capacity of  and obligates the company to a  term note and access to a  revolving line of credit 
the purpose of the term note is to refinance its previous senior term debt and acquisition line of credit 
the revolving line of credit can be used for the purchase of fixed assets  to fund acquisitions  to collateralize letters of credit  and for operating capital 
there was no balance on the line of credit but it collateralized a letter of credit of  as of october  consequently  as of october   there was  available to borrow from the revolving line of credit 
there was  outstanding on the term note as of october  in addition  as of that date  we had  of debt subordinated to our senior credit facility 
as of the end of fiscal year  we had three interest rate hedge swap agreements 
a agreement old swap fixed the interest rate on of the outstanding balance on the term loan the swapped amount with bank of america as required by the previous facility 
the old swap fixed the interest rate for the swapped amount related to the previous facility at and matures in january we entered into an agreement offsetting swap when the previous facility was amended to offset the old swap  for which we receive of the scheduled balance of the old term loan effectively limited any exposure to change in the fair value of the old swap and set a fixed net payment schedule based on the scheduled balance of the old term loan until january when both the old and offsetting swaps mature 
finally  we entered into an agreement new swap to fix the interest rate of of the outstanding balance of the new term note at plus the applicable margin  maturing may as of october   the total notional amount committed to the new swap agreement was  this agreement provides for a monthly settlement in which the company would make or receive payments at a variable rate determined by a specified index one month libor in exchange for making payments at a fixed rate of 
on that date  the variable rate on the remaining of the term note  was 
the new agreement requires that we be in compliance with certain financial covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the covenants include senior debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  total debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  and senior debt to ebitda as defined of no greater than to as of october   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance in the foreseeable future 
the new agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends without prior consent of the lender 
we used  of cash to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market during fiscal year in addition to our senior and subordinated debt commitments  we have significant future cash commitments  primarily in the form of operating leases that are not reported on the balance sheet 
these operating leases are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of october  payment due by period contractual obligations total after debt interest on debt operating leases total interest based on of outstanding senior debt at the hedged interest rate discussed above  of outstanding senior debt at a variable rate of  and subordinated debt at a rate of 
customer deposits have been excluded from the table 
deposit balances vary from period to period with water sales but future increases and decreases in the balances are not accurately predictable 
deposits are excluded because  net of periodic additions and reductions  it is probable that a customer deposit balance will always be outstanding as long as the business operates 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have no other material contractual obligations or commitments 
inflation has had no material impact on our performance 
factors affecting future cash flow generating cash from operating activities and access to credit is integral to the success of our business 
we continue to generate cash from operating activities to service scheduled debt repayment and fund capital expenditures 
in addition  we have capacity to borrow from our acquisition line of credit for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we also lease a significant amount of our vehicles 
recent adverse economic conditions nationally have negatively impacted many businesses revenue and profitability and severely restricted credit availability 
we experienced the effect of this environment throughout fiscal year which resulted in decreased sales and operating profitability 
although our organic sales experienced very limited growth and profitability improved in we do not think that the economy in our region has fully recovered 
like most businesses  we are taking steps to preserve cash flow but no assurance can be given that the future economic environment will not adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations or that we will have adequate access to credit 
factors affecting quarterly performance our business and financial trends vary from quarter to quarter based on  but not limited to  seasonal demands for our products  climate  and economic and geographic trends 
consequently  results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative  through extrapolation  or otherwise  of results for a longer period 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the statements in accordance with these principles requires that we make estimates  using available data and our judgment for such things as valuing assets  accruing liabilities  and estimating expenses 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely review our accounts receivable  by customer account aging  to determine if the amounts due are collectible based on information we receive from the customer  past history  and economic conditions 
in doing so  we adjust our allowance accordingly to reflect the cumulative amount that we feel is uncollectible 
this estimate may vary from the proceeds that we actually collect 
if the estimate is too low  we may incur higher bad debt expenses in the future resulting in lower net income 
if the estimate is too high  we may experience lower bad debt expense in the future resulting in higher net income 
fixed assets depreciation we maintain buildings  machinery and equipment  and furniture and fixtures to operate our business 
we estimate the life of individual assets to allocate the cost over the expected life 
the basis for such estimates is use  technology  required maintenance  and obsolescence 
we periodically review these estimates and adjust them if necessary 
nonetheless  if we overestimate the life of an asset or assets  at a point in the future  we would have to incur higher depreciation costs and consequently  lower net income 
if we underestimate the life of an asset or assets  we would absorb too much depreciation in the early years resulting in higher net income in the later years when the asset is still in service 
goodwill intangible asset impairment we have acquired a significant number of companies 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
if goodwill is not impaired  it would remain as an asset on our balance sheet at the value assigned in the acquisitions 
if it is impaired  we would be required to write down the asset to an amount that accurately reflects its estimated value 
we completed a valuation of the company performed as of october  and  and goodwill was not impaired as of those dates 
the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different market approaches quoted stock price  value comparisons to publicly traded companies believed to have comparable reporting units  and discounted net cash flow 
this approach provides a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and takes into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to its equity value 
on october  the step one assessment yielded the following fair value determined controlling minority interest value value a weighting contribution quoted stock price guideline companies discounted net cash flow concluded fair value a reflects application of control premium under all approaches and addition of cash balance under guideline approach 
as of october  the fair value exceeded the equity value by 
if the equity value exceeds the fair value in step one then step two estimates the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets 
this value is then allocated among the assets and liabilities as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
we relied  in part  on certain assumptions in making the valuation conclusion 
if some or all of these assumptions change in the future  there may be a material impact on the valuation of the company  which may result in an additional impairment of goodwill 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the following we made certain assumptions in the calculation of discount rates  risk premiums  and capital structure weightings 
however  changes in capital markets may significantly change these assumptions in the future 
we used our knowledge of the business  industry and economy to assemble financial projections 
unforeseen events that dramatically change such influential factors as the economy  environment  and weather may positively or negatively affect the accuracy of these projections 
calculation of a control premium is a significant component in the assessment of goodwill 
this is a common valuation technique that relies on assumptions based on equity markets  credit markets and the merger and acquisition environment and the availability of buyers 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis 
the valuation of these deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on estimates that are dependent on rate and time assumptions 
if these estimates do not prove to be correct in the future  we may have over or understated income tax expense and  as a result  earnings 
financial accounting standards board fasb guidance clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
the company adopted these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award under our stock option plans based on the fair value of the award 
the cost of equity is determined using interest rate  volatility  and expected life assumptions 
we estimate a risk free rate of return based on current at the time of option issuance u 
s 
treasury bonds and calculate the volatility of its stock price over the past twelve months from the option issuance date 
the fluctuations in the volatility assumption used in the calculation over the years reported is a direct result of the increases and decreases in the stock price over that time 
all other factors being equal  a increase in the volatility percentage results in approximately a increase in the fair value of the options  net of tax 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various facilities and equipment under cancelable and non cancelable short and long term operating leases  which are described in item of this annual report on form k
