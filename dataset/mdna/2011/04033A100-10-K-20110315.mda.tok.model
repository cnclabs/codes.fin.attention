item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other financial information included herein 
overview our vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines 
our mission is to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company 
product development and discovery our lead cancer product candidate  ridaforolimus  previously known as deforolimus  is being studied in multiple clinical trials in patients with various types of cancers 
in july  we entered into a global collaboration agreement  or the collaboration agreement  with merck co  inc  or merck  under which we shared responsibility for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus for use in cancer 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with merck  referred to as the license agreement  that replaces the collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the license agreement  we granted merck an exclusive license to ridaforolimus for use in cancer  and merck assumed responsibility for all activities related to the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus  as discussed further below 
we initiated patient enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcoma in the third quarter of we enrolled a total of patients in this trial and  in january  announced top line data showing that ridaforolimus met the primary endpoint of improved progression free survival  or pfs  compared to placebo 
this clinical trial remains active  and patients continue to be followed to gather additional data on secondary endpoints  including overall survival and safety 
merck currently plans to file for marketing approval of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas in  subject to final collection and analysis of all available data from the trial 
in addition  merck is currently continuing development of ridaforolimus  as both a single agent and in combination with other agents  in phase and phase clinical trials in several other cancer indications 
our second product candidate  ponatinib  previously known as ap  is an investigational pan bcr abl inhibitor that we believe has broad potential applications in various hematological cancers and solid tumors 
in the third quarter of  we initiated patient enrollment in a pivotal phase clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia  or cml  or philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or ph all 
this trial  named pace ponatinib ph all and cml evaluation  is designed to provide definitive clinical data for regulatory approval of ponatinib in this setting 
the trial is expected to enroll patients at approximately centers in north america  europe  australia and asia 
the primary endpoints are major cytogenetic response rate for chronic phase patients and major hematologic response rate for accelerated or blast phase cml patients and ph all patients 
secondary endpoints include major molecular response rate  duration of response  progression free survival and overall survival 
patient enrollment in this clinical trial is progressing as planned  and we expect to complete patient enrollment by year end our third product candidate is ap  an investigational anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  inhibitor 
we are conducting preclinical testing and other studies required for an investigational new drug application  or ind  and anticipate submitting an ind by mid and beginning a phase clinical trial shortly thereafter 
in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule therapies that are molecularly targeted to cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
our collaboration and license agreements with merck under our collaboration agreement with merck for the global development  manufacture and commercialization of ridaforolimus  we and merck were conducting a broad based development program in multiple potential cancer indications 
the collaboration agreement as in effect until may  provided that each party would fund percent of global development costs  except for certain specific costs to be funded percent by merck 
the collaboration agreement and a related supply agreement established responsibilities for supply of the product for development and commercial purposes  promotion  distribution and sales of the product  governance of the collaboration  termination provisions and other matters 
in addition to cost sharing provisions  the collaboration agreement as in effect until may  provided for an up front payment by merck of million  which was paid to us in july  and provided up to million in milestone payments based on the successful development of ridaforolimus in multiple potential cancer indications  of which million had been paid to us through march   and up to million in milestone payments based on achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
the collaboration agreement provided that each party would receive percent of the profit from the sales of ridaforolimus in the united states  and merck would pay us tiered double digit royalties on sales of ridaforolimus outside the united states 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated collaboration and exclusive license agreement  or the license agreement  with merck that replaces the collaboration agreement and a related supply agreement 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have granted merck an exclusive license to develop  manufacture and commercialize ridaforolimus in oncology  and merck assumed responsibility for all activities related to the development  manufacture and commercialization of ridaforolimus and will fund percent of all ridaforolimus costs effective as of january  if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval  merck will be responsible for selling ridaforolimus worldwide  will record global sales and will pay us tiered double digit royalties on global net sales 
the license agreement provides us with an option to co promote ridaforolimus for all indications in the united states and  in such case  we would be compensated by merck for our sales efforts 
we have elected to exercise our option to co promote ridaforolimus for the sarcoma indication  subject to the terms of a co promotion agreement to be negotiated by us and merck 
under the license agreement  merck paid us an initial up front fee of million in the second quarter of and has agreed to pay us up to million in potential regulatory and sales milestone payments  based on the successful development of ridaforolimus in multiple potential cancer indications or upon achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
these potential milestone payments include up to million associated with potential regulatory filings and approvals for the sarcoma indication  for which we announced positive phase results in january and for which merck has indicated its intention to file for marketing approval in  up to million associated with potential regulatory filings and approvals for other cancer indications and up to million based on achievement of certain sales thresholds 
the license agreement provides that all ridaforolimus activities that had been our responsibility under the collaboration agreement would be transitioned to merck  a process that was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of merck agreed to pay us for all costs we incur related to the transition 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  upon execution of the license agreement  all previously deferred revenue from the collaboration agreement was recognized as revenue in the three month period ended june   which in combination with million of payments received from merck pursuant to the license agreement  was the primary contributor to our license and collaboration revenue of million and our net income of million for the year ended december  as a consequence  our deferred revenue liability at december  related to the collaboration agreement of million including the current portion of that liability has been eliminated and our stockholders deficit at december  of million has become stockholders equity of million at december  liquidity and sources and uses of funding as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  and total stockholders equity of million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations to the fourth quarter of this estimate assumes receipt of a million milestone payment from merck in for the acceptance by the fda of a new drug application for ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas  as well as the exercise of our outstanding warrants  which expire in february  for proceeds to us of million  of which a total of million was received in january and february we do not have significant recurring revenue streams and have historically incurred operating losses and net losses related to our research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses related to our research and development activities in and beyond 
potential sources of funding for such activities beyond our current cash and cash equivalents include potential milestone payments from merck related to regulatory filings and marketing approvals for ridaforolimus including up to million in milestones related to the sarcoma indication and  if ridaforolimus is approved  royalty payments on net sales of ridaforolimus from merck 
we are also pursuing partnering opportunities for the development and commercialization of ponatinib outside of the united states which  if successful  could result in up front  milestone and or potential future royalty payments to us 
in addition  at december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock which expire in february  if not previously exercised 
these warrants have an exercise price of per share and would result in million of proceeds if fully exercised 
in january and february  a total of  warrants were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
we may also seek to raise funding by issuing common stock or other securities in one or more private placements or public offerings  as market conditions permit  or through the issuance of debt 
please see additional information under the caption liquidity and capital resources below 
each of our potential sources of funding is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and there is no assurance that such funding will become available in  or at all  as discussed further in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  accrued product development expenses and the fair value of warrants to purchase our common stock 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from license and collaboration agreements with third parties related to use of our technology and or development and commercialization of product candidates 
such agreements may provide for payment to us of up front payments  periodic license payments  milestone payments and royalties 
for the year ended december   we reported license and collaboration revenue of million 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the fair value of the undelivered element by application of the residual method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
regarding our collaboration agreement with merck for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus  in effect from july to may  we determined the license and development deliverables constituted one unit of accounting and  therefore  the up front and milestone payments were deferred and were being recognized over the performance period 
as a consequence  of the million in up front and milestone payments received from merck pursuant to the collaboration agreement  as of december   million had been recognized as revenue and million had been deferred on our balance sheet 
regarding our license agreement with merck entered into in may that replaced the collaboration agreement  we determined that the license and the transition services were separate units of accounting  and because the fair value of the undelivered transition services is known  the amounts received related to the license and transition services rendered to date would be recognized in the period in which they were received or the services were rendered 
intangible assets at december   we reported million of intangible assets  consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses and the recorded value of the technology associated with our acquisition in september of the percent minority interest of ariad gene therapeutics  inc that we did not previously own  net of accumulated amortization 
the carrying value of these intangible assets is evaluated for possible impairment  and losses are recorded when the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable 
this evaluation involves estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such estimates require judgment regarding future events and probabilities 
changes in these estimates  including decisions to discontinue using the technologies  could result in material changes to our balance sheet and charges to our statements of operations 
if we were to abandon the ongoing development of the underlying product candidates or technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to reserve or write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
in  we recorded charges of million in our statement of operations related to the discontinuation of efforts to pursue our nf b technology and to the assessment of the recoverability of our argent technology and certain other technologies 
accrued product development expenses we accrue expenses for our product development activities based on our estimates of services performed or progress achieved pursuant to contracts and agreements with multiple vendors including research laboratories  contract manufacturers  contract research organizations and clinical sites 
these estimates are recorded in research and development expenses in our statement of operations and are reflected in accrued product development expenses on our balance sheet 
at december   we reported accrued product development expenses of million on our balance sheet 
our estimates of services performed or progress achieved are based on all available information we have obtained through reports  correspondence and discussions with our vendors 
our estimates of accrued expenses based on such information require judgment 
actual costs may vary from such estimates 
when such variances become known  we adjust our expenses accordingly 
fair value of warrants warrants outstanding at december  to purchase  shares of our common stock  issued on february  in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock  are classified as a derivative liability 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting date with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we reported a warrant liability of million on our balance sheet 
these warrants expire in february in january and february  a total of  warrants were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
upon exercise of the warrants  the warrant liability is reduced by the portion of the warrant liability applicable to the exercised warrants  and stockholders equity is increased by this same amount plus the proceeds from the exercise 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if  for example  the volatility of our common stock at december  were higher or lower than used in the valuation of such warrants  our valuation of the warrants would have increased or decreased by up to  with such difference reflected in our statement of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recorded total revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue in consisted of license and collaboration revenue of million and service revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue in includes the million up front payment and a million payment for our share of ridaforolimus costs incurred from january  to may  from merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
license and collaboration revenue in also includes million representing the recognition in of revenue deferred as of december  under our accounting for the collaboration agreement  which was recognized upon execution of the license agreement 
service revenue of million in the year ended december  consisted of transition services that we provided to merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
we expect that our revenue will decrease significantly in because we recognized in all of the previously deferred revenue related to our collaboration agreement with merck and because we substantially completed as of december  the transition of responsibilities to merck pursuant to the license agreement 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration  or fda  in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of our lead product candidate ridaforolimus  for which we initiated clinical development in  and ponatinib  for which we initiated clinical development in the direct external expenses for ridaforolimus reflect our share of such expenses  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may  direct external expenses for ridaforolimus were million in  a decrease of million  as compared to the decrease is primarily due to the restructuring of our collaboration with merck  under which merck is responsible for and funds percent of the cost of ridaforolimus from may  therefore  our expenses during reflect our share of ridaforolimus costs from january  to may   as compared to a full twelve months in the year ended december  we will have no direct external expenses for ridaforolimus in as merck is now responsible for percent of such costs 
direct external expenses for our second clinical program  ponatinib  were million in  an increase of million as compared to the increase is due primarily to an increase in contract manufacturing costs of million  clinical trial costs of million and supporting non clinical costs of  offset in part by a decrease in toxicology costs of million 
toxicology costs decreased due to the completion in of long term toxicology studies necessary to support development of this product candidate 
clinical trials costs increased due to continued enrollment and treatment of patients in our phase clinical trial as well as preparation for and initiation of enrollment of patients in our pivotal phase clinical trial 
contract manufacturing costs increased due to continuing product and process development initiatives as well as the production of ponatinib for use in these clinical trials 
we expect that our direct external expenses for ponatinib will increase in as we enroll additional patients in our phase clinical trial and continue to treat patients in our ongoing phase clinical trial 
the direct external expenses of million incurred in our preclinical program for the year ended december   relate to manufacturing and other ind enabling studies for our third product candidate  ap  an increase of  from we expect that our direct external expenses for ap will increase in as we complete ind enabling studies and expect to initiate a phase clinical trial 
all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase is due in part to the termination in of the cost sharing provisions for ridaforolimus under our collaboration agreement with merck 
in  we received million less in reimbursement from merck than in for its share of our internal costs charged to merck pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
this reimbursement provision ended effective may  with the execution of the license agreement under which we now invoice merck for our services and record such amounts as service revenue 
the increase is also due to an increase of million in expenses related to intellectual property protection of our r d programs  primarily due to reserves for and write offs of certain technologies 
these increases were offset in part by a credit of  related to grants awarded to us by the internal revenue service under the qualified therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program established by the us congress in march as part of the patient protection and affordable care act 
this credit was recorded as an offset to the related r d expenses 
we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in to support the expanding development of ponatinib and ap as well as our ongoing discovery research efforts 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our drug development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our drug development programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by  or percent  from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in professional services of million  primarily due to a reduction in corporate and commercial development initiatives and legal fees related to patent litigation 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses of  due to salary increases and annual performance awards  an increase in overhead and other expenses of  and a decrease of  in reimbursement from merck for its share of our internal costs charged to merck pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in to support our ongoing research and development activities 
we expect that our operating expenses in total will increase in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on  among other things  the progress of our product development programs  including on going and planned clinical trials  results of continuing non clinical studies and the costs of product and process development activities and product manufacturing 
other income expense interest income interest income decreased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of lower interest yields from our invested funds  offset in part by a higher average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at december   due to the net impact of the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the second quarter of and the revaluation of our warrant liability at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  and was due primarily to increases in the market price of our common stock since december  the revaluation of our warrant liability in resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  potential future increases or decreases in our stock price  or other changes in the factors that impact the valuation of the warrant liability  will result in charges or credits  recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
such charges or credits will not have any impact on our cash balances  current liquidity or cash flows unless the conditions that require cash settlement are met 
these conditions include a change in control and the price of our common stock at less than the warrant exercise price 
these warrants expire in february operating results we reported income from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in income of million 
the increase in income from operations is primarily due to the recognition of approximately million in license and collaboration revenue as a result of the accounting impact of the license agreement entered into with merck in may  and a decrease in our share of the costs of development of ridaforolimus 
we also reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net income of million 
the increase in income is largely due to the impact of the license agreement with merck  offset in part by the revaluation of our warrant liability described above 
because the revenue we reported in resulting from the license agreement with merck will not recur in  we do not expect to report net income in  consistent with the stage and status of our research and development efforts 
we expect that our results of operations for will depend on a number of factors  including the progress of our product development programs  the progress of our discovery research programs  the receipt of milestone payments  the exercise of warrants  the impact of commercial and business development activities  and changes in the valuation of our warrant liability  among other factors 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on the sufficiency of funds on hand or available from time to time  which will influence the amount we will spend on operations and capital expenditures as well as the development timelines for our product candidates 
years ended december  and revenue we recognized license and collaboration revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in license and collaboration revenue was due primarily to an increase in the revenue recognized from the merck collaboration  based on the non refundable up front and milestone payments  totaling million  paid by merck through december   including million in milestone payments paid by merck during the year ended december   in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in  as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of our lead product candidate ridaforolimus  for which we initiated clinical development in  and ponatinib  for which we initiated clinical development in the direct external expenses for ridaforolimus reflect our share of such expenses  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck 
direct external expenses for ridaforolimus were million in  an increase of million  as compared to  primarily reflecting our share of increases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing costs million and our share of costs for merck s services million 
clinical trial costs and contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas and in phase clinical trials of ridaforolimus in patients with breast cancer  endometrial cancer  prostate cancer and non small cell lung cancer 
merck s services provided to the collaboration increased as a result of merck s increasing activities in support of clinical trials and other activities for which merck is responsible 
direct external expenses for our second clinical program  ponatinib  were million in  an increase of million as compared to the increase is due primarily to an increase in clinical costs of  and toxicology costs of million 
clinical costs increased due to increasing enrollment in our phase clinical trial in patients with hematologic malignancies 
toxicology costs increased due to the conduct of long term toxicology studies necessary to support development of this product candidate 
the direct external expenses incurred in our preclinical program relate to costs for toxicology studies for our third product candidate  ap we incurred no direct external expenses for preclinical programs in prior to the designation of our third product candidate  all programs other than clinical programs were designated as discovery research and are included in all other r d expenses in the above table 
all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to the corresponding period in this increase is due to an increase in in personnel expenses of million related to the hiring of additional r d personnel  primarily in our clinical  regulatory and manufacturing areas to support the expanding development of our product candidates  and an increase in overhead and general expenses of million due to increased depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures  offset in part by a decrease in lab supplies and services of  and legal and consulting costs of  due to a focus on cost reduction  and an increase in merck s allocated share of our internal expenses under the terms of the collaboration agreement of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent  from million in to million in professional fees decreased by million to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to reduced costs related to corporate and commercial development initiatives  including reduced costs related to the development of systems and processes to support growth  and to our patent infringement litigations against eli lilly and company  or lilly  and amgen inc  or amgen 
other income expense interest income interest income decreased by percent to  in from million in  as a result of lower interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities and a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at its inception in february  resulting in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  the increase in value of the warrant liability is primarily due to the impact of the increase in the market price of our common stock since inception of the warrant 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of  or less than percent 
the increase in loss from operations is largely due to the net impact of increases in r d expenses and decreases in general and administrative expenses described above 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of and  in and  respectively 
the increase in net loss is largely due to the revaluation of our warrant liability described above 
the decrease in net loss per share is largely due to the increase in the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding as a result of sales of common stock completed in february and august selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total revenue net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total revenue net loss net loss per share basic and diluted in may  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with merck for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus that provided for an up front payment of million and resulted in the recognition at that time of previously deferred revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors  collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings upon exercise of warrants pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from long term borrowings up front payment from merck  included in cash provided by operating activities our up front payment of million from merck in was received pursuant to the license agreement entered into in may this up front payment is included in cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  but is presented separately in this analysis due to the non recurring nature of this payment 
the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
on february   we sold  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering to institutional investors  at a purchase price of per share  resulting in net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
the investors also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of per share in cash or pursuant to the net exercise provisions of the warrants 
at the election of the warrant holder  upon certain transactions  including a merger  tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the holder may receive cash in exchange for the warrant  in an amount determined by application of the black scholes option valuation model at the time of any such event  if the consideration received by the stockholders from such transaction is less than per share 
the warrants became exercisable on august  and will expire on february  if not exercised by that date 
on april    warrants were exercised for proceeds of million 
on august   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  including  shares of common stock upon exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and direct expenses  were million 
on october   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  were approximately million 
we have filed shelf registration statements with the sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock or other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants or rights to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to million  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering 
this filing was declared effective on january  following the october  stock issuance  we have approximately million of securities remaining available under this shelf registration statement 
in january  we amended our existing term loan with a bank 
the amendment increases the outstanding balance of the loan from million at december  to million  extends the maturity date from march  to december   and re sets the quarterly repayment provisions  with payments increasing from of the principal amount in the first quarter  commencing on march   to of the principal amount in the final quarter  together with interest  throughout the term of the loan 
all other provisions of our existing loan remain in full force and effect 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities less up front payment from merck adjusted net cash used in operating activities repayment of long term borrowings investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment the net cash provided by or used in operating activities is comprised of our net income or losses  adjusted for non cash expenses  changes in deferred revenue  including deferrals of the up front and milestone payments received from merck  and working capital requirements 
as noted above  we recorded net income for the year ended december  of million 
included in net income for the year ended december  was million of license and collaboration revenue representing the recognition of previously deferred revenue under our collaboration agreement with merck  which had no impact on cash flow during this period 
after taking into account such non cash revenue as well as non cash expenses  and after deducting the million up front payment from merck pursuant to the license agreement  our adjusted net cash used in operating activities decreased by million in as compared to this decrease reflected the impact of actions we took during to conserve cash and capital as we balanced our spending with our available resources  as well as the reduction in expenses related to ridaforolimus which were fully assumed by merck pursuant to the license agreement as of may  as noted above  we expect that we will incur a net loss in due to ongoing development of our product candidates  that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property  will increase in in support of our product development activities  and that our investment in property and equipment will increase in to support growth of our r d and general and administrative functions 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we maintained outstanding letters of credit of  in accordance with the terms of our long term lease for our office and laboratory facility and for other purposes 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under our long term debt agreement  operating and capital lease agreements  employment agreements and benefit plans 
these non cancellable contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  payments due by period in thousands total in through through after long term debt leases employment agreements other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt under the terms of the amendment to our term loan agreement entered into in january  which amendment also increased the loan balance by million to million 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of percent  the interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in leases consist of payments to be made on our lease for our office and laboratory facility  the term of which extends to july subject to two five year renewals  at our option  and on agreements for certain assets acquired under capital leases which expire at various dates into employment agreements represent base salary payments under agreements with officers that extend for terms ranging from one to four years 
other long term obligations are comprised primarily of our obligations under our deferred executive compensation plans 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million at december  for the year ended december   we reported net income of million and cash provided by operating activities of million which reflects the favorable impact of the million up front payment received from merck related to the license agreement entered into in may we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations to the fourth quarter of this estimate assumes receipt of a million milestone payment from merck in for the acceptance by the fda of a new drug application for ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic sarcomas as well as the exercise of our outstanding warrants  which expire in february  for proceeds of million of which a total of million has been received in january and february of we do not have significant recurring revenue streams and have historically incurred operating losses and net losses related to our research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses related to our research and development activities in and beyond 
there are numerous factors that are likely to affect the level of spending on our research and development programs including the number  size and complexity of  and rate of enrollment of patients in  our clinical trials for ponatinib and any clinical trials we may begin for ap  the extent of other development activities for ponatinib and ap  including product and process development  the progress of our preclinical and discovery research programs  the timing and amount of any future milestone and royalty payments related to ridaforolimus from merck  the potential proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock  and the impact of our business development activities 
as noted previously  our license agreement with merck provides potential funding in the form of up to million in regulatory and sales milestone payments  including potential near term milestone payments related to the phase succeed clinical trial of ridaforolimus in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas 
in january  we announced top line data from this clinical trial showing that ridaforolimus met the primary endpoint of improved progression free survival compared to placebo 
merck currently plans to file for marketing approval of ridaforolimus in the united states and europe in  subject to final collection and analysis of all available data from the trial 
we will be eligible to receive up to million in milestone payments from merck related to the sarcoma indication consisting of million for acceptance of a new drug application by the fda which we expect to receive in  million for marketing approval in the united states  million for marketing approval in europe  and million for marketing approval in japan 
in addition to milestone payments  if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval  merck will pay us tiered double digit royalties on global net sales of ridaforolimus 
in addition to potential funding from merck  we are also pursuing partnering opportunities with our second product candidate  ponatinib and other licensing opportunities with our technologies 
such transactions could generate up front and milestone payments as well as funding of on going development costs 
regarding ponatinib  we are focusing our partnering strategy on a regional collaboration in select markets outside of the united states 
we believe that such an approach will allow us to retain substantial potential commercial value of ponatinib for use in cancers 
there is no guarantee  however  that we will be successful in entering into any such partnership arrangements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we will receive any revenue through these partnership efforts in the future 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
we may also seek to raise funds by issuing common stock or other securities in one or more private placements or public offerings  as market conditions permit  or through the issuance of debt 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
at december   we had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of our common stock from our registered direct offering of common stock in february these warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in february in january and february  a total of  warrants were exercised by the holders for proceeds to us of approximately million 
subsequent to the exercises in january and february  a total of  warrants remain outstanding which  if exercised  would provide million in net proceeds to the company 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate preclinical studies  clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates  delay  limit  reduce or terminate our discovery research or preclinical development activities  or delay  limit  reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates

it also changes the level of evidence of stand alone selling prices required to separate deliverables by requiring an entity to make its best estimate of the stand alone selling price of the deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
implementation of this guidance is required no later than fiscal years beginning after june  and this guidance may be applied prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements after the effective date or retrospectively

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
however  because our available funds at december   were invested solely in cash equivalents  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
at december   we have recorded as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock issued to investors in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock on february  the fair value of this warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the market price based on the market price of our stock at december  of our common stock on which the december  valuation was based  the value would have increased by million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on revaluation of the warrant liability in our statement of operations 
at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor plus to percent 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year based on expected balances over the next twelve months
