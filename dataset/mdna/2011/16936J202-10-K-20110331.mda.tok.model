critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements  and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include revenues recognition  valuation of inventories and provisions for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate these e stimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this form k reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred upon shipment or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes the sales of automobiles upon delivery and acceptance by the customers and where collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue related to financing services is recognized ratably over the financing period 
service fees for graphical advertisements on the company s websites are charged on a fixed fee basis 
the company recognizes the advertising revenue when the service is performed over the service term 
the company charges a monthly fee for listing services and recognizes the revenue when services are performed 
the company offers sales incentives to its customers in the form of i subscription exemptions  ii discounted prices and iii free advertisements 
the company classifies sales incentives as a reduction of net revenues 
revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized ratably over the service periods 
the company recognizes revenue from automobile value added services when such services are performed 
receivables related to financing services we record a receivable related to financing services when cash is loaned to customers to finance their purchases of automobiles 
upon repayments by customers  we record the amounts as reductions of receivables related to financing services 
receivables related to financing services represents the aggregate outstanding balance of loans from customers related to their purchases of automobiles and are considered receivables held for investment 
we charge a fee for providing loan service and such fee is prepaid by customers 
we amortize these fees over the receivable term  which is typically days  using the straight line method 
we record such amortized amounts as financing fee income and the unamortized amount is classified as deferred revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables at the end of each of the reporting periods and make estimates for potential credit losses 
we have not experienced any losses on our accounts receivable historically 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventory assessing slow moving and ongoing products 
our products are comprised of the purchase cost of automobiles which declines in value over time 
we continuously evaluate our inventory to determine the reserve amount for slow moving inventory 
income taxes in the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis as of december   the deferred tax assets amounting to  resulting from net operating loss carried forward  advertising expenses and allowance of doubtful accounts are not more likely than not to be realized and a full of valuation allowance has been provided 
the company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to its international subsidiaries as they are to be reinvested indefinitely 
these earnings relate to ongoing operations and are approximately million as of december  because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested 
the company has no material uncertain tax positions as of december  or unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company classifies interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   there are no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment we perform our impairment tests for goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors  including industry and economic trends and changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
as of december   there was no impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives 
accounting for acquisitions we record our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we utilize management estimates and  in some instances  an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted 
such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period  which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date 
for acquisitions after january   adjustments to the purchase price allocation are recorded retrospectively  while for acquisitions prior to january   adjustments to purchase price allocation are recorded prospectively
