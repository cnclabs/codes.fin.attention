overview recent corporate highlights peramivir collaborative agreements 
in january  the us department of health and human services hhs awarded us a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for the treatment of influenza 
during  peramivir clinical development shifted to focus on intravenous delivery and the treatment of hospitalized patients 
to support this focus  a september contract modification was awarded to extend the intravenous iv peramivir program by months and to increase funding by million 
on february   we announced that hhs had awarded us a million contract modification  intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with influenza 
this contract modification brings the total award from hhs to million and extends the contract term by months through december   providing funding through completion of phase and the filing of a new drug application nda to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir in the iv in february  we established a collaborative relationship with shionogi co  ltd 
shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in japan 
in january  shionogi received marketing and manufacturing approval for iv peramivir in japan  and we received a third and final regulatory milestone payment of million in january as a result of this approval 
we may receive future commercial event milestone payments of up to million from shionogi 
shionogi has commercially launched peramivir under the commercial name rapiacta in japan 
shionogi has received the indications of single dose administration of mg iv peramivir for adult uncomplicated seasonal influenza infection  as well as single and multiple dose administration of mg iv peramivir for the patients at high risk for complications associated with influenza 
shionogi is authorized to supply peramivir as either a mg iv bag or a mg vial for iv drip infusion 
on october   we announced that shionogi had received approval of an additional indication for use of iv peramivir to treat children and infants with influenza in japan 
shionogi has stated that it intends to secure an adequate supply of rapiacta to treat approximately one million people during the upcoming influenza season  and that it is taking steps to ensure its manufacturing capability and a stable supply to meet urgent demands 
in the first quarter of  we recorded royalty revenue of approximately million related to sales of rapiacta in japan and the royalties were paid to us by shionogi in the second quarter of rapiacta received accelerated approval in japan in january so it could be made available as a treatment option during the hn pandemic 
at the time of this approval  rapiacta stability testing was ongoing and as a result  the product sold during early had a short shelf life 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to requests from customers to return rapiacta due to the shelf life reaching expiration  shionogi chose to accept returns for substantially all of the million of product shipped early in and 
table of contents submitted the returns to us for credit 
accordingly  we reversed the million of royalty revenue recorded in the first quarter of on march   we announced that we had completed a million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement the shionogi agreement with shionogi  pursuant to which shionogi licensed from us the rights to market peramivir in japan and  if approved for commercial sale  taiwan as part of the transaction  we transferred to jpr royalty sub llc royalty sub  our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary  certain rights under the shionogi agreement  including the right to receive future royalty and milestone payments under the shionogi agreement 
as part of the transaction  we also transferred to royalty sub the right to receive payments under a new japanese yen us dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement that we put into place in connection with the transaction 
our collaboration with shionogi remains unchanged as a result of the transaction 
as part of the transaction  royalty sub issued million in aggregate principal amount of its pharma senior secured notes due the pharma notes in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
the pharma notes bear an interest rate of  with interest payable annually on september st of each year  beginning september   and on the final legal maturity date 
the royalty and milestone payments  if any  that royalty sub will be entitled to receive under the license agreement with shionogi  together with any payments made under the currency hedge arrangement and funds that may be available from certain accounts of royalty sub including an interest reserve account  will be the principal source of payment of principal of  and interest and any premium on  the pharma notes 
the pharma notes are secured by a security interest granted by royalty sub in its rights to receive payments under the shionogi agreement and the currency hedge arrangement  all of its other assets and a pledge by us of our equity ownership interest in royalty sub 
the pharma notes are non callable prior to march  on or after march   the pharma notes may be redeemed at any time prior to maturity  in whole or in part  at the option of royalty sub at specified redemption premiums 
the pharma notes have a final legal maturity of december  under the terms of the pharma notes  when shionogi payments together with any payments made under the currency hedge arrangement received by royalty sub exceed royalty sub s ongoing expenses and the interest payments due annually on the pharma notes  the excess will be applied to the repayment of principal of the pharma notes until they have been paid in full 
accordingly  depending on payments from shionogi  the pharma notes may fully amortize and be repaid prior to the final legal maturity date 
we remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of permaivir by shionogi following repayment of the pharma notes 
the pharma notes constitute obligations of royalty sub  and are non recourse to us except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interest in royalty sub as part of the collateral securing the pharma notes 
the pharma notes are not convertible into our equity 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the transaction after transaction costs and establishment of a million interest reserve account by royalty sub which will be available to help cover any interest shortfalls on the pharma notes through september  in connection with the issuance by royalty sub of the pharma notes  we entered into a foreign currency hedge arrangement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under the currency hedge arrangement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge arrangement remains in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  on may of the relevant year  the us dollar is worth yen or less as determined in accordance with the currency hedge arrangement 
in conjunction with establishing the hedge currency arrangement  we will be required to post collateral to the counterparty  which may cause us to experience additional quarterly volatility in our earnings as a result 
we will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the currency hedge arrangements 
in establishing the hedge  we provided initial funds of approximately million to support our potential hedge obligations 
subject to certain obligations we have in connection with the pharma notes  we have the right 
table of contents to terminate the currency hedge arrangement with respect to the through period by giving notice to the counterparty prior to may  and payment of a million termination fee 
on august   we announced that our partner green cross corporation green cross had received marketing and manufacturing approval from the korean food drug administration for iv peramivir to treat patients with influenza a b viruses  including pandemic hn and avian influenza 
green cross received the indication of single dose administration of mg iv peramivir 
green cross intends to launch peramivir under the commercial name peramiflu in korea 
clinical trials 
on january   we announced top line results from our completed phase safety and virology study of peramivir 
this study was an open label  randomized trial of the anti viral activity  safety and tolerability of iv peramivir administered either as a once daily infusion of mg or a twice daily infusion of mg to adult and adolescent subjects hospitalized with confirmed or suspected influenza infection 
the primary endpoint of the study was the change in influenza virus titer in nasopharyngeal samples  measured by log tissue culture infective dose tcid 
forty four patients who contributed to the primary efficacy analysis had a positive baseline culture  for the mg twice daily group and for the mg once daily group  and both dose regimens were generally safe and well tolerated 
the frequency and severity of adverse events was similar in the two groups  and was consistent with the profile of influenza patients hospitalized during the pandemic 
serious adverse events saes were reported in percent of patients 
overall mortality within days of initial peramivir treatment was percent  no deaths were attributed to study drug  and no safety signals were identified 
the analysis of the combined intent to treat infected itti population showed median time to resolution of fever was hours  time to clinical resolution  hours  time to alleviation of symptoms  hours  and time to resumption of usual activities  days 
further analyses of the data are ongoing  and we will submit detailed analyses for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting 
our ongoing phase efficacy study of iv peramivir is a multicenter  randomized  double blind  controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mg iv peramivir administered once daily for five days in addition to standard of care soc  compared to soc alone  in adults and adolescents who are hospitalized due to serious influenza 
bcx in september  we announced the initiation of a clinical study of bcx for the treatment of gout 
our gout clinical trial was a phase  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered bcx in subjects with gout 
the trial contained two parts part one  which was a parallel group study of multiple doses of bcx randomized against a placebo and part two  which was a sequential group study of escalating doses of bcx  randomized against placebo 
on april   we announced positive top line results from a planned interim analysis of part one of this clinical study 
the study s primary endpoint was the change in serum uric acid sua concentration after days of treatment compared to baseline concentration prior to treatment 
part one of the study randomized gout patients with sua concentrations greater than or equal to mg dl to placebo or to one of three different doses of bcx mg  mg  mg administered once daily for days 
all three doses of bcx demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in sua levels compared to placebo at day bcx also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the proportion of subjects with sua levels less than mg dl  compared to subjects treated with placebo  on day among patients with a baseline sua concentration below mg dl  up to showed sua levels below mg dl on day bcx was generally safe and well tolerated at the doses evaluated in part one of this study 
reductions in peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed in patients treated with bcx overall  the frequency of adverse events in each of the bcx treatment groups was comparable to that observed in the placebo group 
we announced on august  that we achieved positive top line results in part two of this clinical study 
part two of the study was designed to sequentially evaluate the safety and efficacy of up to three higher doses mg  mg and mg once daily of bcx  and included various stopping criteria related to 
table of contents both safety and efficacy 
the primary endpoint of part two of this study was the change in sua concentration at day  following days of once daily treatment  compared to baseline sua concentration prior to treatment 
since all pre specified efficacy criteria were met following administration of the mg dose  the mg dose group was not initiated and the study was stopped 
both doses of bcx evaluated in part two met the primary endpoint of the study 
bcx also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the proportion of subjects with sua levels less than mg dl  compared to subjects treated with placebo  on day overall  the frequency of adverse events in each of the bcx treatment groups was comparable to that observed in the placebo group 
additional studies designed to evaluate longer term exposure are needed to further define the safety and tolerability profile of bcx detailed results from this clinical study were presented at the american college of rheumatology meeting in atlanta  georgia on november  the poster concluded that bcx doses administered at    and mg once daily monotherapy rapidly and significantly reduced sua in patients with gout 
bcx was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses evaluated in the study 
additionally  on june   we announced that we were initiating a second phase study of bcx in patients with gout 
the study was designed to evaluate the urate lowering activity and safety of several doses of bcx alone and in combination with selected doses of allopurinol administered once daily 
on september   we announced positive top line results from this study 
a dose response was demonstrated for both bcx and allopurinol  and the combination of bcx and allopurinol was shown to be superior to either drug alone in sua reduction 
in five of these nine combination groups  percent or more of the patients achieved a sua concentration of less than mg dl 
combinations of lower doses of bcx with allopurinol showed additive or synergistic effects in sua reduction 
the doses of bcx alone and in combination with allopurinol evaluated in the study were generally safe and well tolerated 
on december   we announced the initiation of a phase b study of bcx as add on therapy in gout patients who have not responded adequately to allopurinol therapy alone 
this randomized  double blind  dose response patient study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bcx in combination with allopurinol in gout patients who have failed to reach the sua objective of mg dl following treatment with allopurinol mg alone 
the primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects with sua mg dl at day the study utilizes a parallel group design  evaluating bcx at doses of mg  mg  mg  mg and placebo administered once daily for weeks  in combination with allopurinol s standard dose of mg 
we also plan to initiate a long term safety study of bcx in forodesine on september   we announced preliminary top line results from our pivotal multinational  open label  single arm trial evaluating mg once daily oral forodesine in the treatment of relapsed or refractory ctcl 
the study s primary endpoint was objective response rate  defined as complete or partial cutaneous response that is sustained for at least days  in patients with later stage disease who had previously received at least three systemic therapies for their disease 
eleven of confidence interval later stage patients enrolled achieved a partial cutaneous response  while no patients achieved a complete response 
of the remaining later stage patients  had stable disease as their best response  had progressive disease  with a median time to progression of days  and four were not evaluable 
oral forodesine was generally safe and well tolerated in this study 
long term data from our phase study of forodesine in patients with ctcl was presented at the th annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology in may this poster presentation reviewed the safety and efficacy of forodesine for ctcl patients of stage ib to stage iv who failed standard therapies and received forodesine treatment for greater than months 
also on september   we announced interim results from our exploratory phase study to investigate the efficacy and safety of forodesine as monotherapy for cll 
in this open label  single arm  multi center study  forodesine was administered orally at mg twice daily for day cycles in 
table of contents previously treated cll patients 
the primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate 
consistent with results of previous clinical trials  forodesine was generally safe and well tolerated in this study 
on december   we presented new data from this study that confirmed forodesine s clinical activity in the treatment of cll at the nd annual american society of hematology meeting exposition held in orlando  florida 
an analysis conducted after all patients were followed through months showed that six of response evaluable patients demonstrated a partial response to forodesine  resulting in a response rate of percent 
forodesine mg orally administered twice daily was generally safe and well tolerated in this study 
the pattern  frequencies and severity distribution of adverse events were generally consistent with cll associated poor bone marrow function and immunodeficiency  prior therapies and co morbidities 
we are exploring the interest level of potential partners as a possible path forward for the future development of forodesine in the us absent a us partner  we do not plan to conduct additional studies of forodesine or file a new drug application nda with the us food and drug administration fda 
we have shared this information with mundipharma  along with our decision not to continue further development of forodesine in the us mundipharma has expressed disappointment regarding the development of forodesine and this outcome 
on february   we received a letter from mundipharma s legal counsel notifying us that they intended to utilize the dispute resolution provisions of our agreement with them  which includes meetings of senior management and the later possibility of arbitration 
no amounts have been accrued relating to this matter 
license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university and industrial research  ltd 
aecom and irl respectively 
in may  we entered into an amendment to the license agreement dated june   as subsequently amended the license agreement  by and among us and aecom and irl the licensors 
the amendment further amended the license agreement through which we obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute any drug candidates that might arise from research on a series of pnp inhibitors  including forodesine and bcx under the terms of the amendment  the licensors agreed to accept a reduction of one half in the percentage of future payments received from third party sublicensees of the licensed pnp inhibitors that must be paid to the licensors 
this reduction does not apply to i any milestone payments we may receive in the future under our license agreement dated february  with mundipharma international holdings limited mundipharma and ii royalties received from our sublicensees in connection with the sale of licensed products  for which the original payment rate will remain in effect 
the rate of royalty payments to the licensors based on net sales of any resulting product made by us remains unchanged 
in consideration for the modifications to the license agreement  we issued to the licensors shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of approximately million and paid the licensors approximately  in cash 
additionally  at our sole option and subject to certain agreed upon conditions  any future non royalty payments due to be paid by us to the licensors under the license agreement may be made either in cash  in shares of our common stock  or in a combination of cash and shares 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  total revenues of million consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses  including million from hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir and the sale of million of peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient api and other starting materials to shionogi and green cross  as well as a million milestone payment from shionogi related to the marketing and manufacturing approval of rapiacta in japan during the first quarter full year total revenue of million was significantly impacted by the fourth quarter  primarily due to a million sale to hhs for the supply of iv peramivir for the treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an emergency use authorization eua  and includes million of peramivir development expense reimbursement from hhs 
in addition  we recognized less revenue from our collaboration with mundipharma during compared to 
table of contents cost of products sold for the year ended december  was negligible due to the lower amount of product sale as compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  was approximately million 
included in cost of products sold for the year ended december  is a million provision for peramivir finished goods inventory 
we expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
upon regulatory approval  we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories 
we determined that the fda s granting of the eua for peramivir in october was objective and persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of peramivir inventories manufactured after the issuance of the eua 
as a result  we recorded manufacturing costs of million for peramivir finished goods inventory 
however  we evaluated whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period 
given the lack of objective  reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir  we concluded that there was no certainty that future sales would materialize and revenues would exceed the costs incurred 
therefore  the capitalized inventory was fully reserved 
research and development expenses increased to million for compared to million for the prior year 
the million increase was primarily due to higher development costs associated with the peramivir and bcx programs as well as the company s pre clinical programs 
these increases in r d expenses were partially offset by a decrease in development costs associated with the forodesine program 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to higher consulting fees related to supply chain and other commercial activities  as well as legal fees  operating and personnel related costs 
interest income for was million as compared to million for the prior year  due to higher average cash and securities on hand during as compared to the increase in cash and securities primarily resulted from the sale of million shares of common stock in november resulting in net proceeds of million 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with the year ended december  total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by million in product sales in  primarily the million order of  courses of iv peramivir from hhs  as well as a million milestone payment from our partner  shionogi  related to its filing of an nda to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir in japan 
in addition  revenue from the contract with hhs for the development of peramivir increased by million during as two global phase studies were initiated 
these increases were offset by lower amortization of deferred revenue from our collaborative arrangements 
specifically  million of previously deferred revenue was recognized during as roche terminated its collaboration with us in cost of products sold for the year ended december  was approximately million 
included in cost of products sold is a million provision for peramivir finished goods inventory 
we expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
upon regulatory approval  we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories 
we determined that the fda s granting of the eua for peramivir in october was objective and persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of peramivir inventories manufactured after the issuance of the eua 
as a result  we recorded manufacturing costs of million for peramivir finished goods inventory 
however  we evaluated whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period 
given the lack of objective  reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir  we concluded that there was no certainty that future sales would materialize and revenues would exceed the costs incurred 
therefore  the capitalized inventory was fully reserved 

table of contents the remaining amounts included in cost of products sold for the year ended december  relate to components  secondary packaging  and royalties and commissions paid to third parties as a result of the peramivir product sales 
no costs for the manufacturing of the peramivir finished goods were included in cost of products sold  as the manufacturing was completed prior to the issuance of the eua 
until we sell the inventory for which costs were previously expensed  our cost of products sold will reflect only incremental costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of the eua in october as such  if we sell that portion of our existing inventory  there will be a period of time where revenue could be recognized with little or no corresponding cost 
therefore  we anticipate that the gross margin on future product sales  if any  will fluctuate and not be comparable from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for due to reductions of million in clinical development costs  million in manufacturing costs  and million in toxicology costs for the forodesine program  as well as lower costs of million related to our pre clinical compounds and million in general operating and personnel related costs 
in addition  million of previously deferred expense was recognized during as roche terminated its collaboration with us in these decreases were offset by higher clinical development costs of million for peramivir and million for bcx in  as well as an increase of million in manufacturing and million in consulting fees for the peramivir program 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees 
interest income for was million as compared to million for the prior year  due to a lower average cash and securities balance as well as significantly lower yield earned on interest bearing assets 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities and cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts 
on february   we announced that hhs had awarded us a million contract modification intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir and on march   we completed a million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments 
see recent corporate highlights  peramivir above for further discussion and details regarding the implication of these transactions 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and interest income 
we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities in general and specifically related to our clinical trial activity 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 

table of contents the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of our credit exposure 
we have not realized any significant losses from investments 
during  and  we incurred capital costs of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of approximately  in   in and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following payments under our contract with hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
for the year  our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  our net cash burn for was million  or million per month 
for  we expect that cash use will be approximately million 
our cash use will vary depending on clinical outcomes and could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the timing of company expenses and the related reimbursement from our collaborators 
as our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount and timing of funding we receive from hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs 
with the funds available at december  and future amounts that are expected to be received from hhs  net proceeds from the march  financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement with shionogi  and our other collaborators  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  
table of contents the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain drug candidates  or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and we may seek to raise capital at any time we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
on march   we completed a million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the shionogi agreement 
as part of the transaction  we transferred to royalty sub certain rights  including the right to receive future royalty and milestone payments from shionogi 
as part of the transaction  royalty sub issued million in aggregate principal amount of its pharma notes 
the pharma notes bear an interest rate of  with interest payable annually on september st of each year  beginning september   and on the final legal maturity date of december  the pharma notes constitute obligations of royalty sub  and are non recourse to us except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interest in royalty sub as part of the collateral securing the pharma notes 
the pharma notes are not convertible into our equity 
see recent corporate highlights  peramivir above for further discussion and details regarding the implications of this transaction 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  the table below does not include obligations resulting from the royalty 
table of contents monetization transaction  discussed above  that closed on march  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other purchase commitments 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  
table of contents fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from collaborative and other research and development arrangements and product sales 
collaborative and other research and development arrangements revenue from license fees  royalty payments  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting 
revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
under certain of our license agreements  we receive royalty payments based upon our licensees net sales of covered products 
generally  under these agreements  we receive royalty reports from our licensees approximately one quarter in arrears  that is  generally in the second month of the quarter after the licensee has sold the royalty bearing product 
we recognize royalty revenues when we can reliably estimate such amounts and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue paid by shionogi on their product sales is subject to returns 
peramivir is a newly introduced product and there is no historical experience that can be used to reasonably estimate product returns 
therefore  we defer recognition of royalty revenue from shionogi until a right of return no longer exists or until it has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate product returns 
reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under the company s contract with hhs  revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred 
product sales sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price was fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales are recognized net of 
table of contents estimated allowances  discounts  sales returns  chargebacks and rebates 
product sales recognized during and were not subject to a contractual right of return 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cros  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cros 
costs for studies performed by cros are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees 
we expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we expense maintenance payments as incurred 
at december   we had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately million 
these deferred expenses were sub license payments  paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners  and other consideration to our academic partners for modification to existing license agreements 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments or modifications from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 

table of contents the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated amounts in millions year ended december  direct external r d expenses by program pnp inhibitor forodesine neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir pnp inhibitor bcx other all other r d expenses compensation and fringe benefits professional services travel overhead allocation and other direct external r d expenses by program at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of our various product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
as such  we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our product development programs in the future 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda  or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the sec 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are unavailable 
stock based compensation all share based payments  including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock awards  are recognized in our income statement based on their fair values 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
generally  our investments are not collateralized 
we have not realized any significant losses from our investments
