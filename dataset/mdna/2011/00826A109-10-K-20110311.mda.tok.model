item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel drugs to improve the treatment of serious and often life threatening conditions 
our product candidate  peginesatide hematide tm recently completed phase clinical trials to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
anemia is a serious condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells and hemoglobin 
it is common in patients with chronic renal failure  cancer  heart failure  inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses  as well as in the elderly 
if left untreated  anemia may lead to chronic fatigue or increase the risk of other diseases or death 
currently recombinant epo  or repo  is used to manage the anemia of dialysis  non dialysis and cancer patients 
peginesatide is a synthetic peptide based erythropoiesis stimulating agent  or esa  designed to stimulate production of red blood cells 
peginesatide is designed to be longer acting than currently marketed esas in the us and therefore has the potential to offer reduced cost and complexity for healthcare providers 
in late june  we announced preliminary top line results from our peginesatide phase clinical program for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
our phase clinical program included four open label  randomized controlled clinical trials 
of these trials  two trials  called pearl and pearl  were conducted in non dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginesatide compared to darbepoetin alfa to correct anemia and maintain hemoglobin in a corrected range over time 
the other two trials  called emerald and emerald  were conducted in dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginesatide and its ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in a corrected range compared to epoetin alpha or epoetin beta when switched to peginesatide 
analysis of efficacy and safety for all of the phase studies were based on primarily assessments of non inferiority to the comparator drugs 
the primary efficacy endpoint  the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline  in each of the four phase studies met the statistical criteria for non inferiority 
in addition  peginesatide met the statistical criterion for non inferiority for the assessment of safety for the cardiovascular composite safety endpoint  or cse  which was composed of death  stroke  myocardial infarction  congestive heart failure  unstable angina and arrhythmia from a pooled safety database across the four phase studies 
however  some differences were observed when secondary analyses were conducted as previously described in our current report on form k dated june  
table of contents based on our discussions with the us food and drug administration  or fda  we plan to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda  for treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure patients on dialysis in the second quarter of despite meeting the primary efficacy endpoints and the cse for peginesatide  the differences observed in the phase secondary analyses present risks to our ability to obtain regulatory approval for peginesatide particularly in view of the heightened concerns surrounding safety of esas 
any negative perception of peginesatide safety relative to other esas would significantly reduce the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval for peginesatide 
the issues arising from the phase results have caused significant delay and may continue to negatively impact the timelines for development and the likelihood  scope or conditions surrounding regulatory approval 
any or all of these factors may significantly reduce the ultimate commercial potential of peginesatide 
in september  we obtained an equity line of credit arrangement  with azimuth opportunity ltd  or azimuth  that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million worth of shares of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement the common stock purchase agreement 
in september  we entered into an amendment  or the amendment  to the common stock purchase agreement with azimuth  which extends the term of the equity facility to september and reduces the minimum threshold price we may establish at which  upon presentation to azimuth of a draw down notice  azimuth is required to purchase shares of our common stock 
the amendment further provides that in no event may we sell under the purchase agreement more than such number of shares of common stock which is equal to one share less than of our outstanding shares of common stock on the effective date of the amendment 
in october  we closed on the sale of  shares of common stock to azimuth under the common stock purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our net proceeds from the sale of these shares were million after deducting our offering expenses 
our equity facility is subject to a number of conditions that limit our ability to draw against such facility 
for example  azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
in addition  azimuth is not obligated to purchase shares of our common stock which  when aggregated with all other shares of our common stock then owned beneficially by azimuth  would result in the beneficial ownership by azimuth of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
at december  this represents  shares 
after deducting the shares purchased in october  assuming that all remaining  shares were sold at the closing price of our common stock at december  at the largest possible discount and assuming that azimuth still owns these shares  the maximum aggregate net proceeds we could receive under the agreement with azimuth would be approximately million 
in october  the arbitration panel in our binding arbitration with johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  llc  and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  or j j  decided the ownership of a number of us and international patents and patent applications related to certain epo r agonists  or the intellectual property in dispute 
the decision maintained j j sole inventorship and sole ownership of us patent no 
 or the patent  and certain related foreign patents and patent applications  including european patent application ep  the arbitrators determined that we and j j jointly own the remainder of the intellectual property in dispute 
we are continuing to review the arbitrators decision and consider potential courses of action with our counsel and takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda 
we expect that this dispute with j j could involve additional litigation or legal proceedings that may take years and substantial resources and funds to resolve 
although we believe that peginesatide does not infringe the patent and that we would have substantial defenses to any potential claims by j j  j j may now or in the 
table of contents future attempt to assert claims based upon the patent against us or our collaborators in connection with the manufacture and commercialization of peginesatide 
outside of the us  the european patent application ep  and other foreign counterpart patents to the patent differ in the nature and extent of the claims from that of the patent and due to the complexity of patent laws  we are unable to assess adequately the defenses available to us in the various countries outside of the us to any potential claims by j j alleging infringement of any of the foreign counterparts to the patent 
if j j is successful in asserting its rights under the patent and related foreign cases  j j may prevent us from manufacturing or commercializing peginesatide  either for ourselves or with takeda or any potential sublicensees  or obtain a royalties on sales of peginesatide until expiration of these patent rights in in addition  an adverse outcome could result in liability for damages  attorneys fees and costs 
if intellectual property in dispute that has been deemed to be jointly owned is broad enough to cover peginesatide  then under the laws applicable in certain relevant jurisdictions outside the u 
s  joint ownership may not allow us to license third parties manufacture and sell peginesatide or even to do so ourselves  which may negatively affect our development and business plans outside the us or our collaboration with takeda 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings  additional litigation or legal proceedings or even the risk thereof may make it more difficult to commercialize peginesatide 
the threat of such legal uncertainty may make it difficult for peginesatide to gain market acceptance by health care providers  patients  payors or dialysis clinics  any of which may be concerned about the reliability of supply or reluctant to become involved in the prospect of existing or potential litigation 
we continue to consider our legal alternatives in this dispute 
to date  we have incurred significant expense in pursuing this matter  including substantial time and effort on the part of our technical  legal and management personnel 
as final resolution of this dispute may not be reached for years  we expect to incur significant expenses and diversion of resources for years 
further  the risk or existence of litigation or legal proceedings with j j may limit our ability to finance  and even if such financing is available  to achieve terms that are favorable to us 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  reimbursement for development expenses and active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  production  license fees and milestone payments from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financings  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
other than the three and six month periods ended june   we have incurred net losses since our inception 
however  due to the recognition of revenues from milestone payments from our collaboration with takeda  we were profitable in the three and six months ended june  and may have profitable quarters from time to time if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for peginesatide 
we continue to expect to incur substantial losses for the next several years in order to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
since the announcement of our phase data in late june and the arbitration decision in october  we have experienced a severe decline in our stock price  which has impaired our ability to access capital on potentially favorable terms 
in contrast  our need to raise funding has only increased due to the peginesatide development program delays  the potential loss of milestone payments from takeda associated with the non dialysis indication and the potential for future legal proceedings and costs 
as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize peginesatide  if approved  we may experience further challenges or delays if issues arise or additional requirements are imposed based on our discussions with the fda and other regulatory agencies or as a consequence of our dispute with j j 

table of contents our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market and the issues arising from our phase results significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of peginesatide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations  which could negatively impact our ability to complete development or commercialize peginesatide 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing  particularly at our recent stock trading levels  would be difficult to obtain  if accessible at all  and our current stockholders may be significantly diluted 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses consist of i expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites  which conduct a substantial portion of our pre clinical studies and all of our clinical trials  ii payments to contract manufacturing organizations  which produce our api  iii payments to consultants  iv license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property  v employee related expenses  which include salaries and related costs  and vi facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
all r d expenses are expensed as incurred 
for our r d expenses  we have historically commenced tracking the costs for a project when we are working with another company or when the product candidate merits substantial increase in the level of effort 
in recent years  our r d efforts have been almost exclusively focused on the development of peginesatide  specifically on the phase trials commenced in for the years ended december   and  the percentage of our r d expenses related to peginesatide  excluding stock based compensation expense  were  and  respectively 
under the worldwide agreement with takeda  we and takeda will co develop and co commercialize peginesatide in the us beginning january   takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of peginesatide  which was fully utilized by both parties through the first quarter of thereafter  takeda has borne of the third party us development expenses while we have been responsible for of third party expenses 
we retain responsibility for of our internal development expenses  most notably employee related expenses 
in addition  third party expenses related to the commercialization of peginesatide in the us are equally shared by both parties and beginning in mid  certain employee related expenses supporting commercialization will also be equally shared 
takeda will have primary responsibility and bear all costs for peginesatide clinical development in support of regulatory approval for all territories outside the us the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial 
table of contents may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing peginesatide  in the future we may develop additional product candidates internally and in license product candidates  which would increase our r d expenses in later periods 
during the year ended december   we finalized amendments for certain clinical trial activities completed in in the fourth quarter of  we obtained final monitored site visit data and investigator contracts from our third party contract research organizations  or cros  that allowed us to complete our reconciliation of the significant majority of the labor and investigator costs incurred throughout the course of our clinical trials to our previously recorded estimates 
this data and contractual information was not available to us during the course of the trials 
after extensive analysis to cost out and analyze the information provided  we determined that the costs incurred were lower than our previously recorded estimates 
the change in estimate is due largely to i lower total patient months on study as compared to our previously estimated level as a result of a larger number of patients coming off study and no longer having trial related site visits also known as lost to follow up during the course of the study  and ii lower than expected average fee generating site visits per month  driven largely by missed visits from patients on study 
we believe these changes were only identifiable based on the information received in the fourth quarter of the change in estimate decreased expense by million for the year ended december  additional changes in estimate or adjustments may result as the final trial close out audits and fee negotiations are completed relating to our clinical trials which could impact r d expense and collaboration revenue and amounts due to or from takeda in subsequent periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business and commercial development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in r d expense  patent filing  prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance  revenue recognition in financial statements 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
application of this guidance requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
in february and june  we entered into two separate collaboration agreements or the arrangement with takeda  which have been combined for accounting purposes due to their proximity of negotiation 
we evaluated the multiple elements under the combined single arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we determined the deliverables do not have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and we were unable to obtain verifiable objective evidence to determine the fair value of the undelivered elements 
accordingly  we concluded that there was a single unit of accounting 
effective january   we entered into an amendment to the arrangement with takeda 
the amendment provides us the ability to opt out of our obligation to participate on the joint steering committee and any related subcommittees at any time beginning january  without any other modifications 
as a result  the obligation to participate in the joint steering committee and any related subcommittee is no longer indefinite 
accordingly  we determined that we can separate the performance obligations that occur over the development period from the performance obligations that will occur during the commercialization period 
we had previously estimated the development period to end on january  based on the announcement on june  of our top line results from our phase clinical program  during the second quarter of we re evaluated our development period and determined that the development period was estimated to end upon submission of our nda to the fda  estimated to occur in the first half of after further refinements to our regulatory strategy as a result of our subsequent meeting with the fda in november  we re evaluated the estimated filing date for our nda submission and believe it to be in the second quarter of as a result of the change in performance period from indefinite to a definitive date  beginning on january   we recognize revenue during the development period using the contingency adjusted performance model  or capm 
under capm  revenue is eligible for recognition in the period the payment is earned under the arrangement including amounts that are either received or due from takeda 
revenue initially recognized is based on the percentage of time elapsed from inception of the arrangement in june to the period in which the payment is earned in relation to the total projected development period 
the remaining portion of the payment is then recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the development period of the arrangement 
payments during the development period include amounts due for upfront license fees  milestone payments earned  purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredient or api and reimbursement of development and commercial expenses 
further changes in the estimated term of the development period could materially affect the amount of collaboration revenue recognized in future periods 
a change in the estimated term of the development period could materially affect the amount of collaboration revenue recognized in future periods 
we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
included in the reimbursable expense is the cost of api that we manufacture and supply 
table of contents to takeda during the development period  which we will also supply during the commercialization period 
license and royalty revenue royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reported and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties received under agreements that were acquired by us in the spin out from glaxosmithkline or glaxo are recorded net of the that we are required to remit to glaxo 
clinical trial expense and accruals we record expense for external costs incurred on our clinical studies based on our estimates of the costs incurred each period 
these clinical trial costs  which represent a significant component of r d expenses  were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our clinical trials are administered by cros  who typically perform most of the total start up activities for the trials  including document preparation  site identification pre study visits  training as well as on going program management 
for the phase studies  which represent the vast majority of the clinical trial expense  the expense recorded is based on reporting received from cros and internal analyses 
we accrue costs for work performed by cros based on the achievement of contracted activities during the period 
expense for investigator fees  which include patient costs  is based on internal estimates of activities using patient enrollment and contractual or estimated rates 
for the phase studies  the expense is activities based such as patient monitoring as reported by the cros and achievement of milestones 
other costs such as testing and drug materials are expensed as incurred 
for all studies  cro reporting is reviewed by us for appropriateness 
there is a significant degree of estimation involved in quantifying the clinical study expenses due to the complexity and magnitude of the clinical trial activities these estimates have been subject to frequent adjustments  especially for our phase trials  in part due to our negotiations with third parties with respect to timing of reporting  patient progression and payments as well as our continuing negotiations with cros  on timely delivery and access to information necessary to validate our accruals 
additional changes in estimate or adjustments to previously presented amounts in r d expense may result as the reconciliation activities and final negotiations with our cros are completed on our clinical trials 
during the quarter ended june   we identified an overstatement of clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue of million in the year ended december  as a result  clinical trial expense and collaboration revenue  which included reimbursement for these costs  included an out of period reduction of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we finalized amendments for certain clinical trial activities completed in which decreased expense by million for the year ended december  due to a change in estimate  as more fully described above in the research and development expenses section 
additional changes in estimate or adjustments may result as the final trial close out audits and fee negotiations are completed relating to our clinical trials which could impact r d expense in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  the amount of stock based awards 
table of contents that are expected to be forfeited and the expected life of the stock based payment awards 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock or restricted stock units  or rsus  market quotes are not available for long term  non transferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
we base our estimated expected option term and volatility on the realized volatilities of our peer companies 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under the authoritative guidance for share based payments 
there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the authoritative guidance for share based payments requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the allocation of employee stock based compensation costs to each operating expense line are estimated based on specific employee headcount information at each grant date and estimated stock option forfeiture rates and revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual employee headcount information or forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated forward looking forfeiture rate 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards and historical experience 
these estimates are revised in subsequent periods based upon changes in facts or circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different than what was recorded in the current period 
for awards with a longer vesting period  the actual forfeiture rate and related expense may not be known for a longer period of time  which can result in more significant accounting adjustments once the awards are either vested or forfeited 
as a result  the amount of employee stock based compensation costs we recognize in each operating expense category in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  that prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance resulted in no adjustment to our accumulated deficit as of january  we had million  million and million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december    and  respectively 

table of contents at december  and  our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively  and is reflected as long term income tax liabilities on our balance sheet 
our policy is to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense  respectively  as necessary 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized   and  respectively  of interest expense related to our liability for uncertain income tax positions 
for the years ended december  and  there were no penalties related to uncertain income tax positions 
for the year ended december    of penalties related to uncertain income tax positions were required and recognized 
at december    was accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions 
we do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next twelve months 
results of operations revenue revenue and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change collaboration revenue license and royalty revenue total revenue we recognized million  million and million of collaboration revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the collaboration revenue for the year ended december  included a million cumulative adjustment resulting from an amendment to the collaboration agreements with takeda  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements and an out of period reduction of million 
collaboration revenue includes our expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda  net of takeda own eligible expenses 
collaboration revenue in was down slightly from due largely to decreased third party development expenses reimbursed by takeda related to our phase clinical trials which were completed in early and the associated impact of our change in estimate adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of related to our clinical trial expense 
the associated impact to revenue was a decrease of million 
the increase in collaboration revenue in and was due to the growth in third party development expenses reimbursed by takeda related to our phase clinical trials  which commenced in late and achieved full enrollment in late as well as the continued amortization of revenue from expense reimbursements and milestones received from takeda in prior periods 
we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
a change in the estimated term of the development period could materially affect the amount of collaboration revenue recognized in future periods 
based on the announcement on june  of our top line results from our phase clinical program  during the second quarter of we re evaluated our development period and determined that the development period was estimated to end upon the submission of our nda to the fda  estimated to occur in the first half of after further refinements to our regulatory strategy as a result of our subsequent meeting with the fda in november  we re evaluated the estimated filing date for our nda submission and now believe it to be in the second quarter of each of these changes resulted in an extension of the development period as compared to our previous estimates and will result in the remaining deferred collaboration revenue being recognized over this longer period 
we recognized   and  of license and royalty revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the license and royalty revenue in was due to

as a result  we recorded adjustments to estimates in the year ended december  relating to estimates previously recorded in our expenses for the years ended december  and these changes in estimate decreased expense by million for the year ended december  additional changes in estimate or adjustments may result as the reconciliation activities and final trial close out negotiations are completed relating to our clinical trials which could impact r d expense in subsequent periods 
we expect r d expenses to substantially decrease in due to the completion of the treatment and follow up of our phase clinical trials in which decrease could be partially offset by any additional research and clinical trials conducted to obtain additional data for peginesatide 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change general and administrative expenses the decrease in g a expenses in was primarily due to lower legal costs 
the increase in g a expenses in as compared to was primarily due to higher legal costs 
legal costs primarily relate to protecting and defending our proprietary rights  such as patents  and fluctuate with the level of such activity 
we expect to incur increasing general and administrative expenses in future periods to support our preparation for our nda for peginesatide and development of commercial capabilities

provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change provision benefit for income taxes calculation not meaningful we are subject to federal and california state income tax 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for minimum statutory state tax and provided no federal tax as a result of our net operating loss 
for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million 
the tax benefit was for federal tax purposes  primarily the result of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of enacted in november  which allowed us to carryback our net operating loss to and recover million in alternative minimum taxes previously paid for the year ended december  we also recorded a  federal benefit related to refundable r d credits available to us pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was signed into law in july 
table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of  consisting of  of federal tax benefit and  of net california state income tax expense 
the  of federal tax benefit was primarily due to refundable r d credits available pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was signed into law in july the california state income tax expense of  was primarily related to an out of period reduction to our california r d credits that was partially offset by additional california r d credits that were identified 
as of december  and  we have a net deferred tax asset balance of million each  in consideration of the uncertainty in income taxes liability recorded for the same amount 
we considered the following positive and negative factors in determining that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset as of december   and would be realized net deductible temporary differences that were expected to reverse in and there were no relevant tax strategies available that we would consider feasible 
uncertainties  such as regulatory approval of peginesatide and potential litigation with certain subsidiaries of j j  that if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect our future operations

from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities  million of upfront license fees  million in milestone payments and million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api from our collaboration agreements with takeda 
takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of peginesatide  which was fully utilized by both parties through the first quarter of thereafter  takeda has borne of the third party us development expenses  while we have been responsible for of third party expenses 
we retain responsibility for of our internal development expenses  most notably employee related expenses 
in addition  third party expenses related to the commercialization of peginesatide in the us are equally shared by both parties and beginning in mid  certain employee related expenses supporting commercialization will also be equally shared 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily the result of million in milestone payments received from takeda as well as lower r d expenses 
r d expenses were lower as a result 
table of contents of completion of our phase clinical trials in early and our change in estimate described earlier 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to significant changes in working capital  most notably a million reduction in the change  year over year  in deferred revenue  offset by a million reduction in the change  year over year  in accrued clinical trial expenses 
net cash used in operations for all periods reflects the benefit of reimbursement received from takeda for development and commercial expense and purchase of api by takeda 
from the inception of our collaboration with takeda through december   we had received a total of million for such reimbursement 
in addition to the reimbursement received from takeda  we received a million cash milestone payment for the initiation of japan phase renal indication and million milestone payments for database lock of the non dialysis and dialysis phase clinical trials during we are eligible to receive additional clinical development and regulatory milestones from takeda of approximately million relating to the dialysis as the first renal indication  including million milestone payments upon fda acceptance of the submission of the nda and million of milestone payments upon approval by the fda 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively  was a result of purchases of investments partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  of million was primarily the result of proceeds from maturities and sales of investments partially offset by purchases of investments 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the million repayment of our loan from ubs  during the year  partially offset by million in net proceeds from a financing executed under our equity line of credit with azimuth during the years 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the net proceeds from two financings during the year  specifically million from the private placement in march and million of net proceeds from a public offering in november  as well as million in proceeds from the ubs loan in december the private placement also included warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at that are exercisable and expire in march each of the three years ended december    and include proceeds from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in september we obtained an equity line of credit arrangement  with azimuth  that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million worth of shares of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement the common stock purchase agreement 
in september  we entered into an amendment  or the amendment  to the common stock purchase agreement with azimuth which extends the term of the equity facility to september and reduces the minimum threshold price we may establish at which  upon presentation to azimuth of a draw down notice  azimuth is required to purchase shares of our common stock 
the amendment further provides that in no event may we sell under the purchase agreement more than such number of shares of common stock which is equal to one share less than of our outstanding shares of common stock on the effective date of the amendment 
in october  we closed on the sale of  shares of common stock to azimuth under the common stock purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our net proceeds from the sale of these shares were million after deducting offering expenses 
our equity facility is subject to a number of conditions that limit our ability to draw against such facility 
for example  azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
in addition  azimuth is not obligated to purchase shares of our 
table of contents common stock which  when aggregated with all other shares of our common stock then owned beneficially by azimuth  would result in the beneficial ownership by azimuth of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
at december   this represents  shares 
after deducting the shares purchased in october  assuming that all remaining  shares were sold at the closing price of our common stock at december  at the largest possible discount and assuming that azimuth still owns these shares  the maximum aggregate net proceeds we could receive under the agreement with azimuth would be approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a focus on liquidity and capital preservation 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we expect that we will need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
since the announcement of our phase data  we have experienced a severe decline in our stock price  which has impaired our ability to access capital on potentially favorable terms 
in contrast  our need to raise funding has only increased due to the peginesatide development program delays  the reduction of potential milestone payments from takeda associated with the non dialysis indication and the potential for future legal proceedings and costs 
as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize peginesatide  if approved  we may experience further challenges or delays to approval of peginesatide if issues arise or additional requirements are imposed based on our discussions with the fda and other regulatory authorities or as a consequence of our dispute with j j 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  we have had to reduce our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of peginesatide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors and are not limited to the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of pre clinical studies and clinical trials for peginesatide  our ability to fulfill our obligations under our collaboration agreements with takeda and to achieve the milestones contained therein  costs of litigation  
table of contents outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of drug candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of peginesatide and future product candidates  if any  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations and significant commitments our future contractual obligations  including financing costs  at december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term income tax liability total fixed contractual obligations relates primarily to minimum lease payments for lease of our facilities  consisting of approximately  square feet which expire in september with respect to our long term income tax liability as of december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
in april  we entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with nektar therapeutics al  corporation  or nektar  under which we obtained from nektar a worldwide  non exclusive license  with limited rights to grant sublicenses  to certain intellectual property covering pegylation technology to manufacture  develop and commercialize peginesatide 
in consideration of the license grant  we agreed to pay royalties on the sales of peginesatide 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments totaling up to million  plus possible additional milestones in connection with our partnering activities relating to peginesatide or merger and acquisition activities 
in july  we paid nektar a million milestone payment triggered by the collaboration agreements signed with takeda in february and june under the agreement  we also engaged nektar for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of bulk poly ethylene glycol reagent for the manufacture of peginesatide 
this relationship is managed by a managing committee formed by representatives from both us and nektar 
nektar is obligated to engage a third party manufacturer in the event of nektar failure as defined in the agreement to supply reagent 
this agreement expires  on a country by country basis  upon the expiration of our royalty payment obligations 
the agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party material breach provided that such other party has been given a chance to cure such 
table of contents breach  or by nektar for our challenge of the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in asc topic  revenue recognition  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe 
if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
asu no 
also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not believe there will be a significant impact on our financial statements from the adoption of asu no 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic  which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
however  the fasb clarified that  even if the requirements in asu no 
are met  entities would not be precluded from making an accounting policy election to apply another appropriate accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion of the arrangement consideration 
asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe there will be a significant impact on our financial statements from the adoption of asu no
