item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of august   and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
plan of operation and overview our goal is to research  produce  and deliver medicines that improve life for patients with severe  rare disorders 
our product portfolio includes both candidates from our proprietary drug targeting platforms and in licensed and acquired product candidates 
our current pipeline includes three clinical development programs  which we are actively developing 
we also have two other clinical stage product candidates  one of which we are seeking additional business development partners in asia but are not internally developing  and we have three preclinical product candidates for which we are seeking development partners 
clinical development programs our three active clinical development programs are based on an existing therapeutic that we are reformulating and repurposing for potential improvement in safety and or efficacy and for application in new disease indications 
these clinical development programs include the following dr cysteamine  or rp  for the potential treatment of cystinosis  a rare genetic disorder  and rp for the potential treatment of huntington s disease  or hd  an inherited neurodegenerative disorder 
rp is our proprietary delayed release formulation of cysteamine bitartrate microbeads in capsules  which may require less frequent dosing and reduce gastro intestinal side effects compared to the current standard of care 
rp  for the potential treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis  or nash  a metabolic disorder of the liver 
rp is our proprietary delayed release formulation of cysteamine bitartrate in tablets 
other clinical stage product candidates our other clinical stage product candidates include convivia for the potential management of acetaldehyde toxicity due to alcohol consumption by individuals with aldehyde dehydrogenase  or aldh deficiency  an inherited metabolic disorder  and tezampanel  a glutamate receptor antagonist as a potential anti platelet agent 
preclinical product candidates our preclinical platforms consist of targeted therapeutics for the potential treatment of multiple indications  including liver diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and breast cancer 
we are seeking development partners for these programs 
these preclinical programs include the following our receptor associated protein  or rap  platform consists of heptide for the potential treatment of primary liver cancer and other liver diseases  and neurotrans to potentially deliver therapeutics across the blood brain barrier for treatment of a variety of neurological diseases 
our mesoderm development protein  or mesd  platform consists of wnttide for the potential treatment of breast cancer 
future activities over the next months  we plan to conduct research and development and general and administrative activities including pre commercial preparation for the potential launch of rp for the treatment of cystinosis in the united states and europe  supporting our ongoing extension study of rp in cystinosis  supporting the ongoing clinical trial of rp in hd  funding a potential collaboration in a clinical trial of rp in nash  funding a potential clinical trial of tezampanel as a potential anti platelet agent  continued business development of our preclinical product candidates  and supporting associated facilities and administrative functions 
we plan to seek additional business development partners for our convivia product candidate in asia 
we may also develop future in licensed technologies and acquired technologies 
clinical development programs we develop clinical stage drug product candidates which are internally discovered therapeutic candidates based on our novel drug delivery platforms and in licensed or purchased clinical stage products which may be new chemical entities in mid to late stage clinical development  currently approved drugs with potential efficacy in additional indications  and treatments that we could repurpose or reformulate as potentially more effective or convenient treatments for a drug s currently approved indications 
lead clinical development program development of rp for the potential treatment of nephropathic cystinosis or cystinosis our rp product candidate is a proprietary delayed release  enteric coated microbead formulation of cysteamine bitartrate contained in a gelatin capsule 
we are investigating rp for the potential treatment of cystinosis 
immediate release cysteamine bitartrate  a cystine depleting agent  is currently the only fda and the ema  approved drug to treat cystinosis  a rare genetic disease 
immediate release cysteamine has been reported to be effective at preventing or delaying kidney failure and other serious health problems in cystinosis patients 
however  we believe that patient compliance is challenging due to the requirement for every six hour dosing and gastrointestinal side effects 
our rp for the potential treatment of cystinosis is designed to mitigate these difficulties 
it is expected to be dosed twice daily  compared to the current every six hour dosing schedule 
in addition  rp is designed to pass through the stomach and deliver the drug directly to the small intestine  where it is more easily absorbed into the bloodstream and may result in fewer gastrointestinal side effects 
the ema and fda granted orphan drug designation for rp for the treatment of cystinosis in calendar and  respectively 
in june  we commenced our phase b clinical trial of rp in cystinosis  in which we enrolled nine cystinosis patients with histories of non compliance using the currently available immediate release form of cysteamine bitartrate 
the clinical trial  which was conducted at the university of california at san diego  or ucsd  evaluated safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of rp in patients 
in november  we released the data from the study which indicated improved tolerability and the potential to reduce total daily dosage and administration frequency compared to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate 
on july   we announced that our phase clinical trial of rp for the treatment of cystinosis  met the sole primary endpoint of non inferiority compared to cystagon  immediate release cysteamine bitartrate 
the comparison was based on white blood cell  or wbc  cystine levels  the established efficacy surrogate biomarker and sole primary endpoint in the clinical trial 
there were no unexpected serious safety concerns experienced by patients in the trial attributable to rp our pivotal phase clinical trial was designed as an outpatient study of the pharmacodynamics  pharmacokinetics  safety and tolerability of rp compared to cystagon in cystinosis patients 
the clinical trial was conducted at eight clinical research centers in the us and europe 
of patients who completed the phase protocol  were included in the evaluable data set  not being fully compliant with the protocol due to the fact that their wbc cystine levels went above while on cystagon during the trial 
the age range of study participants was years  with of patients below years old 
on average  the peak wbc cystine level measured in patients treated with cystagon was nmol cystine mg protein  compared to an average peak value of nmol cystine mg protein for patients treated with rp the mean difference was nmol cystine mg protein  with a confidence interval of one sided p 
as stipulated in our statistical analysis plan  the non inferiority endpoint of the clinical trial would be achieved when the upper end of the confidence interval around the mean difference of wbc cystine levels did not exceed an absolute value of the upper end of the confidence interval in the phase clinical trial was determined to be  thus achieving the non inferiority endpoint 
additionally  the endpoint was achieved at a lower average daily dose of rp  compared to cystagon 
patients enrolled in the study were required to be well controlled under the existing cystagon therapy 
the starting dose of rp for patients in the phase clinical trial was initially set at of their established dose of cystagon 
the protocol allowed for a single rp dose increase of  based on intermediate wbc cystine level results  to reflect the current standard of care in establishing appropriate dosing of cystagon in cystinosis patients 
approximately one third of patients remained at of their starting cystagon dose throughout the study 
the remaining two thirds of the patients had their rp dose increased 
on average  the total daily  steady state dose of rp in patients in the phase clinical trial was of their established  incoming dose of cystagon 
in the course of the study  no unexpected safety issues were experienced 
seven serious adverse events  or saes  requiring a visit to the emergency room or hospital  were reported for seven individual patients 
of these seven saes  six were determined by the principal investigator to be unrelated to either rp or cystagon 
one sae  gastric intolerance  was graded as possibly related to rp and was subsequently resolved and the patient returned on rp treatment 
that patient completed the rp study and continued on the extension study described below 
the most frequently reported non serious adverse events  or aes  in the study were gastric intolerance symptoms 
fifty three aes were scored as possibly or probably related to either study drug  and forty three of fifty three of the drug related aes were scored as gastric intolerance symptoms 
we are conducting an ongoing  extension study in which all patients completing the phase clinical trial may elect to continue on rp treatment and are monitored for wbc cystine levels and safety parameters 
the extension study will provide at least six months of safety data for each patient and will be part of our new drug application filing 
forty out of forty one patients who completed the phase clinical trial elected to enroll in the extension study 
thirty eight of such patients remain in the extension study 
thirty two patients have been on rp in the extension study for at least months 
we plan to submit our phase clinical trial data for publication in the coming months 
in a related clinical trial  we performed a bioequivalence study between rp administered as whole capsules and rp administered as capsule contents sprinkled onto applesauce 
as a significant number of cystinosis patients are too young to take whole capsules  this result may enable us to expand enrollment in the extension study to patients who are too young to swallow whole capsules and were therefore ineligible for the pivotal phase clinical trial protocol 
with respect to rp for the treatment of cystinosis  we expect to file an nda with the fda and a marketing authorization application  or an maa  with the ema  in the first calendar quarter of in october and november  we had a pre nda meeting with the fda and a pre maa meeting with the ema  respectively  resulting in no change to our expected nda or maa filing timelines 
if rp is approved by the fda or ema for the treatment of cystinosis  we plan to commercialize rp in the us or europe by ourselves 
however  we may enter into marketing partnerships for certain markets outside of the us and europe 
development of rp for the potential treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis or nash in october  we commenced a clinical trial in collaboration with ucsd to investigate a prototype formulation of rp for the treatment of nash in juvenile patients 
in may  we presented positive phase a clinical trial results from our pilot study of delayed release cysteamine bitartrate in adolescent patients with nash  a progressive form of liver disease believed to affect to of the us population 
the results were presented at the digestive disease week conference in new orleans  louisiana on may  our open label phase a clinical trial was conducted under a collaboration agreement with ucsd at ucsd general clinical research center 
eligible patients with baseline levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase  or alt  and aspartate aminotransferase  or ast  that were at least twice that of normal levels  were enrolled to receive twice daily  escalating oral doses of up to  mg of delayed release cysteamine bitartrate a prototype of our rp for six months  followed by a six month post treatment monitoring period 
patients showed a marked decline in alt levels during the treatment period with of patients achieving a greater than reduction and of reduced to within normal range 
ast levels also saw significant improvements with patients averaging reduction by the end of the treatment phase 
the reduction in liver enzymes was largely sustained during the month post treatment monitoring phase 
other important liver function markers showed positive trends 
levels of cytokeratin  a potential marker of disease activity in non alcoholic fatty liver disease  or nafld  decreased by an average of 
adiponectin levels increased by an average of during the treatment period 
reduced adiponectin levels are thought to be a marker of the pathogenesis and progression of nash 
body mass index  or bmi  did not change significantly during both the treatment and post treatment phases 
delayed release cysteamine bitartrate demonstrated a strong  favorable safety profile  with mean gastrointestinal symptom scores of at baseline and after months of treatment using a rating system in which the maximum score of indicates most severe gastrointestinal symptoms 
there are no currently approved drug therapies for nash  and patients are limited to lifestyle changes such as diet  exercise and weight reduction to manage the disease 
rp may provide a potential treatment option for patients with nash 
although nash is most common in insulin resistant obese adults with diabetes and abnormal serum lipid profiles  its prevalence is increasing among juveniles as obesity rates rise within this patient population 
although most patients are asymptomatic and feel healthy  nash causes decreased liver function and can lead to cirrhosis  liver failure and end stage liver disease 
we are currently working with our clinical trial material manufacturer to produce rp for our next potential clinical trial in nash and are preparing an ind submission in late calendar in anticipation of such clinical trial 
we are in late stages of discussions to collaborate with a national health organization for the clinical development of rp in juveniles with nash 
assuming we receive the anticipated level of grant support from this organization  we anticipate initiating our phase b clinical trial for rp in the first half of calendar and releasing the top line phase b clinical trial data in the second half of calendar development of rp for the potential treatment of huntington s disease or hd huntington s disease  or hd  is a fatal  inherited degenerative neurological disease affecting about  people in the us and a comparable number of people in europe 
we are not aware of any treatment for hd other than therapeutics that minimize symptoms such as the uncontrollable movements and mood swings resulting from hd 
we are collaborating with a french institution  chu d angers  on a phase clinical trial investigating rp in hd patients  which began in october we are providing the clinical trial materials for the study  which is sponsored by chu d angers and funded in part by a grant from the french government 
eight clinical sites in france are being set up by chu d angers for a patient  placebo controlled  month trial  followed by an open label trial with all placebo patients rolling onto rp and all non placebo patients continuing on rp for up to another months 
the primary end point of the trial will be based upon the unified huntington s disease rating scale  or uhdrs 
we were granted orphan drug designation in the us by the fda for cysteamine as a potential treatment for hd in and are in the process of applying for orphan drug designation in the eu we anticipate reaching full enrollment for our phase clinical trial for rp in patients with hd in the fourth quarter of calendar and we anticipate releasing the top line phase clinical trial data in the middle of calendar in june  we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property related to the potential treatment of hd from the weizmann institute of science in israel and niigata university in japan 
the weizmann and niigata patents cover the use of transglutaminase inhibitors  a class of molecules chemically similar to cysteamine  in the potential treatment of hd and other neurological disorders 
these patents add to our portfolio of intellectual property related to our programs utilizing rp rp other clinical stage product candidates we have two other clinical stage product candidates 
convivia for liver aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency convivia is our proprietary oral formulation of methylpyrazole  or mp  intended for the potential treatment of acetaldehyde toxicity resulting from alcohol consumption in individuals with aldh deficiency  which is an inherited disorder of the body s ability to breakdown ethanol  commonly referred to as alcohol intolerance 
mp is presently marketed in the us and eu in an intravenous form as an anti toxin 
convivia is designed to lower systemic levels of acetaldehyde a carcinogen and reduce symptoms  such as tachycardia and flushing  associated with alcohol consumption by aldh deficient individuals 
convivia is a capsule designed to be taken approximately minutes prior to consuming an alcoholic beverage 
in  we completed a phase a dose escalation clinical trial of oral mp with ethanol in aldh deficient patients 
the study results demonstrated that the active ingredient in convivia significantly reduced heart palpitations tachycardia  which are commonly experienced by aldh deficient people who drink  at all dose levels tested 
the study also found that the mp significantly reduced peak acetaldehyde levels and total acetaldehyde exposure in a subset of the study participants who possess specific genetic variants of the liver adh and aldh enzymes 
we believe that this subset represents approximately one third of east asian populations 
in june  we entered into an exclusive agreement with uni pharma co  ltd  or uni pharma to commercialize convivia in taiwan 
under terms of the agreement  we will grant to uni pharma an exclusive license under all relevant patent applications  trademarks and future patents controlled by us to market convivia in taiwan  with an option to expand the license to south korea under the same terms 
uni pharma will register convivia for drug licensure for existing indications and will conduct a clinical trial and register conviviatm for acetaldehyde toxicity resulting from aldh deficiency 
uni pharma will be responsible for marketing and sales activities for the commercialization of convivia in the markets covered under the license agreement 
we continue to seek potential partners in other asian countries to continue clinical development of conviviatm in those countries 
tezampanel for anti platelet therapy thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the united states 
in addition to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus  thrombotic mechanisms predominate as the basis for both heart attack and stroke 
during thrombosis  platelets become activated  a process involving a cascade of signaling factors  ultimately leading to aggregation and the formation of a solid mass  the thrombus  within blood vessels 
in addition to such well known platelet signaling molecules as thromboxane a blocked by aspirin and adenosine diphosphate blocked by plavix  research conducted at jhu  by dr 
craig morrell and dr 
charles lowenstein demonstrated the importance of glutamate release in promoting platelet activation and thrombosis 
this research showed that platelets treated with an ampa kainate receptor antagonist such as tezampanel are more resistant to glutamate induced aggregation than untreated platelets 
glutamate release by a platelet acts to stimulate release of glutamate from other platelets  potentiating aggregation and the formation of the thrombus 
released glutamate acts by binding cell surface glutamate receptors expressed on platelets themselves 
one particular type of the glutamate receptor is important in platelet activation  the ampa receptor 
compounds that specifically activate the ampa receptor can increase platelet activation 
conversely  compounds that inhibit the ampa receptor decrease platelet activation 
this identifies the ampa kainate receptors on platelets targeted by tezampanel as a new antithrombotic target with a different mechanism of action than plavix  aspirin or tpa 
tezampanel is a molecule developed by eli lilly and licensed to us 
tezampanel has been shown to inhibit human platelet activation  subsequent human platelet aggregation  and thrombosis in mice 
the inventors of this novel technology are dr 
lowenstein and dr 
morrell  currently at the university of rochester in new york 
the use of glutamate receptor antagonists as anti platelet agents is covered by pct us  assigned to jhu and exclusively licensed to us 
tezampanel has been extensively tested in phase clinical trials for safety in various indications 
the drug candidate has been demonstrated to be safe over a wide range of doses  without any serious adverse events and without any major abnormal laboratory tests 
human pharmacokinetics of tezampanel are well characterized 
in collaboration with dr 
lowenstein and dr 
morrell  we are preparing to conduct a phase clinical trial in healthy volunteers to determine the efficacy of tezampanel in blocking platelet activation and aggregation 
we anticipate this early stage trial to commence by the end of preclinical product candidates we are also developing a drug targeting platform based on the proprietary use of rap and mesd 
we believe that these proteins may have therapeutic applications in cancer  infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases  among others 
these applications are based on the assumption that our targeting molecules can be engineered to bind to a selective subset of receptors with restricted tissue distribution under particular conditions of administration 
we believe these selective tissue distributions can be used to deliver drugs to the liver or to other tissues  such as the brain 
in addition to selectively transporting drugs to specific tissues  selective receptor binding constitutes a means by which receptor function might be specifically controlled  either through modulating its binding capacity or its prevalence on the cell surface 
mesd is being engineered for this latter application 
heptide for hepatocellular carcinoma or hcc and other liver diseases drugs currently used to treat primary liver cancer are often toxic to other organs and tissues 
we believe that the pharmacokinetic behavior of rap ie  the determination of the fate or disposition of rap once administered to a living organism may diminish the non target toxicity and increase the on target efficacy of attached therapeutics 
in preclinical studies of our radio labeled heptide a variant of rap  heptide  our proprietary drug targeting peptide was shown to distribute predominately to the liver 
radio labeled heptide  which was tested in a preclinical research model of hcc at the national research council in winnipeg  manitoba  canada  showed times more delivery to the liver than the radio labeled control 
another study of radio labeled heptide in a non hcc preclinical model  showed times more delivery to the liver than the radio labeled control  with significantly smaller amounts of radio labeled heptide delivery to other tissues and organs 
hcc is caused by the malignant transformation of hepatocytes  epithelial cells lining the vascular sinusoids of the liver  or their progenitors 
heptide has shown to bind to lipoprotein receptor related protein  or lrp  receptors on hepatocytes 
we believe that the pharmacokinetics and systemic toxicity of a number of potent anti tumor agents may be controlled in this way 
there are additional factors that favor the suitability of rap as an hcc targeting agent rap is captured by hepatocytes with efficiency  primarily on first pass 
late stage hcc is perfused exclusively by the hepatic artery  while the majority of the liver is primarily perfused through the portal vein 
studies have shown that the rap receptor  lrp  is well expressed on human hcc and under expressed on non cancerous  but otherwise diseased  hepatocytes 
also  lrp expression is maintained on metastasized hcc 
these factors will favor delivery of rap peptide conjugated anti tumor agents to tumor cells  whether in the liver or at metastasized sites 
we are evaluating conjugates between heptide and other molecules for testing in vitro and in appropriate preclinical models for the potential treatment of hcc and other liver diseases 
neurotrans for the potential treatment of diseases affecting the brain hundreds of known genetic and neurodegenerative diseases affect the brain 
drugs often have difficulty reaching these disease affected areas because the brain has evolved a protective barrier  commonly referred to as the blood brain barrier 
part of the solution to the medical problem of neurodegenerative diseases is the creation of effective brain targeting and delivery technologies 
one of the most obvious ways of delivering therapeutics to the brain is via the brain s extensive vascular network 
treating these diseases by delivering therapeutics into the brain in a minimally invasive way  including through a natural receptor mediated transport mechanism called transcytosis  is a vision shared by many researchers and clinicians in the neuroscience and neuromedical fields 
neurotrans is our proprietary rap based technology program to research the delivery of therapeutics across the blood brain barrier 
we believe our neurotrans platform may provide therapies that will be safer  less intrusive and more effective than current approaches in treating a wide variety of brain disorders 
in preclinical studies  neurotrans has been conjugated to a variety of protein drugs  including enzymes and growth factors  without interfering with the function of either fusion partner 
studies indicate that radio labeled neurotrans may be transcytosed across the blood brain barrier and that fusions between neurotrans and therapeutic proteins may be manufactured economically 
experiments conducted in collaboration with stanford university in support the neurotrans peptide s ability to enhance the transport of cargo molecules into the cells that line the blood brain barrier 
in june  we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
and hoffman la roche inc  or roche  to evaluate therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier utilizing neurotrans 
under the terms of the agreement  roche has funded studies of select molecules attached to neurotrans 
following some initial studies  roche decided to terminate its agreement with us effective october we are currently reviewing potential out licensing opportunities for neurotrans and continue to maintain the program s intellectual property portfolio 
wnttide for the potential treatment of cancer human mesd is a natural inhibitor of the receptor lrp lrp has recently been shown to play a role in the progression of some breast tumors 
studies in the laboratory of professor guojun bu  one of our scientific advisors  at the washington university in st 
louis medical school support the potential of mesd and related peptides to target these tumors 
these molecules and applications are licensed to us from washington university 
wnttide is our proprietary  mesd based peptide that we are developing as a potential therapeutic to inhibit the growth and metastasis of tumors over expressing lrp or lrp we have licensed the use of mesd from washington university for the potential treatment of cancer and bone density disorders 
in april  washington university conducted a preclinical study of wnttide in a breast cancer model which showed tumor inhibition 
the results of this study were presented at the nd annual wnt conference in washington  dc  in june and have been published in the peer reviewed publication  the proceedings of the national academy of sciences  on march  the paper  titled  lrp overexpression defines a class of breast cancer subtype and is a target for therapy  presented results that support the potential efficacy of wnttide as a targeted treatment for triple negative breast cancers  a particularly aggressive and difficult to treat indication for recurrent and metastatic disease 
abnormal wnt activation  found in to of breast cancers  is often associated with triple negative breast cancers 
we are currently evaluating wnttide in a preclinical breast cancer model to inhibit the wnt signaling pathway designed to block cancers dependent upon signaling through lrp  as well as other ind enabling studies 
other development areas securing additional and complementary technology licenses from others we plan to establish additional research collaborations with prominent universities and research labs currently working on the development of potential targeting molecules  and to secure licenses from these universities and labs for technology resulting from the collaboration 
no assurances can be made regarding our ability to establish such collaborations over the next months  or at all 
we intend to focus our in licensing and product candidate acquisition activities on identifying complementary therapeutics  therapeutic platforms that offer a number of therapeutic targets  and clinical stage therapeutics based on existing approved drugs in order to create proprietary reformulations to improve safety and efficacy or to expand such drugs clinical indications through additional clinical trials 
we may obtain these products through collaborations  joint ventures or through merger and or acquisitions with other biotechnology companies

goodwill is reviewed annually  or when an indication of impairment exists  to determine if any impairment analysis and resulting write down in valuation is necessary 
fixed assets fixed assets  which mainly consist of leasehold improvements  lab equipment  computer hardware and software and capital lease equipment  are stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the related estimated useful lives  except for leasehold improvements and capital lease equipment  which are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term 
significant additions and improvements that have useful lives estimated at greater than one year are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
should an impairment exist  the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset s fair value or discounted estimates of future cash flows 
we have not identified any such impairment losses to date 
common stock warrant liabilities the warrants issued by us in the private placement contain a cash out provision which may be triggered upon request by the warrant holders if we are acquired or upon the occurrence of certain other fundamental transactions involving us 
this provision requires these warrants to be classified as liabilities and to be marked to market at each period end commencing on august  the warrants issued by us in our december equity financing contain a conditional obligation that may require us to transfer assets to repurchase the warrants upon the occurrence of potential future events 
under the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  a financial instrument that may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets is classified as a liability 
therefore  we have classified the warrants as liabilities and will mark them to fair value at each period end 
the common stock warrants are re measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
warrants which are recorded as liabilities that are exercised are re measured and marked to market the day prior to exercise 
upon exercise of such warrants  the fair value of such warrants is reclassified to equity 
income taxes income taxes are recorded under the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
research and development we are a development stage biotechnology company 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
research and development expenses include medical  clinical  regulatory and scientists salaries and benefits  lab collaborations  preclinical studies  clinical trials  clinical trial materials  regulatory and clinical consultants  lab supplies  lab services  lab equipment maintenance and small equipment purchased to support the research laboratory  amortization of intangible assets and allocated executive  human resources and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses are offset by contra expenses which are reimbursements of research and development expenses received either from research collaborators or from government grants or tax rebates 
in process research and development prior to september   we recorded in process research and development expense for a product candidate acquisition where there is not more than one potential product or usage for the assets being acquired 
upon the adoption of the revised guidance on business combinations  effective september   the fair value of acquired in process research and development is capitalized and tested for impairment at least annually 
upon completion of the research and development activities  the intangible asset is amortized into earnings over the related product s useful life 
in process research and development that is amortized or expensed is recorded as part of research and development expenses on our statements of operations 
we review each product candidate acquisition to determine the existence of in process research and development 
comprehensive loss components of comprehensive loss are reported in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they are recognized 
the components of comprehensive loss include net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments 
stock based compensation in february  our board of directors approved  and in march our stockholders approved  our equity incentive plan  or the plan  to grant up to an aggregate of  stock options or restricted stock or restricted stock units over the ten year life of the plan 
our board of directors has determined not to make any new grants under any of our former plans  but rather under the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
on april   our stockholders passed amendments to the plan which allow for an increase of the grant pool based upon of our common stock outstanding as of april   august  and august  up to an aggregate maximum increase of  shares 
the april  and august  increases added  and  shares  respectively  available for grant under the plan 
the amendments also allow for accelerated vesting of unvested stock options upon a change of control as defined in the plan  as amended 
in september  our board of directors approved an amended and restated form of award agreement to the plan  which will be used for awards granted on or after september  the amended and restated award agreement  subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreement  extends the termination date of the awards granted under the plan that are vested as of such termination date due to a an employee s or a non employee director s retirement at age or older which employee or non employee director has at least five years of continuous service with us prior to such retirement  b the termination of a non employee director s board membership for reasons other than for cause or retirement and c an employee s or a non employee director s death during his or her continuous service with us or within days of such continuous service with us or permanent disability  to eighteen months from the date of termination of continuous service with us 
in may  raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
s stockholders approved the equity compensation plan  as amended  referred to herein as the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
effective as of the effective time of the merger  we assumed the outstanding stock options of raptor pharmaceuticals corp 
granted under the plan 
such assumed options are subject to the terms of the plan and  in each case  are also subject to the terms and conditions of an incentive stock option agreement  non qualified stock option agreement or other option award  as the case may be  issued under such plan 
prior to the merger  and subject to the merger becoming effective  our board of directors adopted the plan such that the plan became an equity incentive plan of ours after the merger 
typical option grants under the and plans are for ten years with exercise prices at or above market price based on the last closing price as of the date prior to the grant date on the relevant stock market or exchange and vest over four years as follows ths on the six month anniversary of the date of grant  and th per month thereafter 
effective september   our stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with asc topic  accounting for compensation arrangements  or asc topic previously listed as statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  and related interpretations 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behavior 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
in march  the fasb issued asc topic previously listed as staff accounting bulletin no 
 which offers guidance for what was previously referred to as sfas r 
asc topic was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r while enhancing the information that investors receive 
asc topic creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes a considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement sfas r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and b reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
key topics covered by asc topic include valuation models  expected volatility and expected term 
for the year ended august   stock based compensation expense was based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the following risk free interest rate of to  year expected life  to volatility  turnover rate  and dividend rate 
we based our black scholes inputs on the following factors the risk free interest rate was based upon our review of current constant maturity treasury bill rates for seven and five years average  the expected life of six years was based upon our assessment of the ten year term of the stock options issued along with the fact that we are a development stage company and our anticipation that option holders will exercise stock options when we are at a more mature stage of development  the volatility was based on the actual volatility of our common stock price as quoted on nasdaq since the closing of our merger on september   the turnover rate was based on our assessment of our historical employee turnover  and the dividend rate was based on our current decision to not pay dividends on our stock at our current development stage 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in the application of asc topic  the compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our accounting for stock based compensation 
we recognize as consulting expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
stock options issued to consultants are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the fasb asc topic  equity based payments to non employees previously listed as emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
the fair value of expensed options is based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the same factors as stock based compensation expense discussed above

any of our major programs could be partnered for further development and or could be accelerated  slowed or ceased due to scientific results or challenges in obtaining funding 
we anticipate that we will need additional funding in order to pursue our plans beyond the next months 
in addition  the timing and costs of development of our programs beyond the next months is highly uncertain and difficult to estimate

in summary  rp rp is being developed in cystinosis  nash and hd 
in july  we announced that our phase clinical trial of rp for the treatment of cystinosis met its sole primary clinical endpoint and in november  we released data from our phase b clinical trial 
we plan to file for marketing approval of rp for cystinosis in the first calendar quarter of in may  we presented the data from our nash phase a clinical trial and are reformulating the drug product candidate rp for a potential phase b trial in early calendar in october  our collaborator commenced a phase a clinical trial of rp in hd patients and we anticipate full enrollment by the end of calendar with potential data by mid calendar our conviviatm product candidate completed its initial clinical study in and in june  we licensed convivia tm to uni pharma for further clinical development in taiwan  with an option to develop conviviatm in south korea 
we continue to seek other potential partners for conviviatm in other asian countries where its potential market exists 
we are seeking to out license our tezampanel product candidate and are preparing for a phase clinical trial for the potential treatment of thrombotic disorder 
heptidetm will be undergoing further preclinical proof of concept studies and wnttidetm and neurotranstm are being considered for potential out licensing for further development 
all preclinical product candidates will require further study prior to potentially moving into a clinical phase of development

foreign currency transaction loss foreign currency transaction loss increased by for the year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to the addition of a euro denominated bank account and subsidiary in fiscal resulting from the creation of a european subsidiary to manage our european clinical trials 
adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants increased by million resulting in an increase to our net loss for the year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to the fact that there was no warrant liability recorded in the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources capital resource requirements as of august   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  approximately million in current liabilities of which million represented the non cash common stock warrant liability and approximately million of net working capital deficit 
our forecasted average monthly cash expenditures for the next twelve months are approximately million 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of september  of approximately million which includes approximately million of net proceeds in connection with our underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock that was announced on september  will be sufficient to meet our obligations at least through the first calendar quarter of our recurring losses from operations and our accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and  as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  with respect to this uncertainty 
we may need to generate significant revenue or raise additional capital to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the first calendar quarter of in addition  the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
the sale of additional securities is likely to result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available when needed in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
we may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors  including our financial condition  the status of our research and development programs  and the general condition of the financial markets 
if we fail to raise additional financing when needed  we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development programs  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected and we may have to scale back our operations 
in december  we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement  or the direct offering purchase agreement  dated as of december   with investors collectively  the direct offering investors with respect to the sale of units  whereby  on an aggregate basis  the investors agreed to purchase  units for a negotiated purchase price of per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock  one series a warrant exercisable for of a share of our common stock and one series b warrant exercisable for of a share of our common stock 
the shares of our common stock and the warrants were issued separately 
the series a warrants exercisable for an aggregate  shares of our common stock were exercisable commencing on june  and ending december  the series b warrants exercisable for an aggregate  shares of our common stock were exercisable commencing on june  and ending june  the investor warrants have a per share exercise price of 
in connection with this offering we paid a placement agent cash compensation equal to of the gross proceeds or  plus a five year warrant at an exercise price of per share for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
as of september    shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the series a warrants   shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the series b warrants and  shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the placement agent warrants 
as of september   series a warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock were outstanding 
on august   we entered into the private placement purchase agreements with the private placement investors for the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  at a purchase price of per unit  with each unit comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
we issued and sold an aggregate of  units  comprised of an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
each warrant  exercisable for years from august   has an exercise price of per share 
the placement agent for the private placement was issued one warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  paid a cash commission of  and reimbursed for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with the private placement 
as of september    shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the warrants 
as of september   warrants to purchase up to  shares including the placement agent warrants of our common stock were outstanding 
on september   we announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the shares sold in the offering included million shares of our common stock plus an additional million shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of the over allotment option we granted to them 
total gross proceeds to us in the offering including in connection with the sale of the shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option were million  before underwriting discounts and commissions 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deduction of underwriting discounts and other offering expenses payable by us 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund our commercial and pre commercial efforts  clinical and preclinical development programs and other general corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operation 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not able to obtain financing on a timely basis  we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business 
this also may be the case if we become insolvent or if we breach our asset purchase agreement with biomarin  our licensing agreements with washington university  ucsd  yeda or ua  or due to non payment and we do not cure our non payment within the stated cure period 
if this happens  we would lose all rights to the rap technology assigned to us by biomarin  the rights to mesd licensed to us by washington university  the rights to rp and rp licensed to us by ucsd  and the rights licensed to us by yeda and ua  depending on which agreement is breached 
for the next months we intend to expend a total of approximately million to implement our operating plan of preparing for commercial launch of rp for the treatment of cystinosis  continued research and development of our rp and rp clinical programs  our rap based platform  our licensed technologies  as well as continuing business development efforts for our other clinical stage product candidates 
specifically  we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next months to be as follows estimated spending for the next months in millions research and development activities research and development compensation and benefits general and administrative and pre commercial activities general and administrative compensation and benefits capital expenditures total estimated spending for the next months we anticipate that we will not be able to generate revenues from the sale of products until we further develop our drug product candidates and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market our future drug product candidates  which could take several years or more  if we are able to do so at all 
accordingly  our cash flow projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond our control  including successfully developing our drug product candidates  market acceptance of our drug product candidates  competition from well funded competitors  and our ability to manage our expected growth 
it is likely that for many years  we will not be able to generate internal positive cash flow from the sales of our drug product candidates sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements 
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long term financing  the successful development of our drug product candidates and related technologies  the successful and sufficient market acceptance of any product offerings that we may introduce and  finally  the achievement of a profitable level of operations 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us is likely to result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders 
obtaining commercial loans  assuming those loans would be available  including on acceptable terms  will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments 
research and development activities we plan to conduct further research and development  seek to support several clinical trials for rp and rp  improve upon our rap based and in licensed technology and continue business development efforts for our preclinical and other clinical stage product candidates in the next months 
we plan to conduct research and development activities by our own laboratory staff and also by engaging contract research organizations  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations 
we also plan to incur costs for the production of our clinical study drug candidates  rp and rp  clinical trials  clinical and medical advisors and consulting and collaboration fees 
we anticipate our research and development costs for the next months  excluding in house research and development compensation  will be approximately million 
officer and employee compensation we have seven executive officers  one permanent scientific staff member  three permanent clinical development staff members and one permanent finance staff member 
we plan on adding several personnel in the areas of sales and marketing  regulatory  medical affairs  quality and finance 
we anticipate spending up to approximately million in officer and employee compensation during the next months  of which million is allocated to research and development expenses and million is allocated to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative we anticipate spending approximately million on general and administrative costs in the next months 
these costs will consist primarily of pre commercial activities in anticipation of approval and launch of rp for cystinosis  legal and accounting fees  patent legal fees  investor relations expenses  board fees and expenses  insurance  rent and facility support expenses  excluding finance and administrative compensation 
capital expenditures we anticipate spending approximately  in the next months on capital expenditures for lab equipment and office furniture

on june   we made a milestone payment in the amount of  to biomarin because we raised  in our may  private placement financing 
if we become insolvent or if we breach our asset purchase agreement with biomarin due to non payment and we do not cure our non payment within the stated cure period  all of our rights to rap technology including neurotranstm will revert back to biomarin

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu   intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires us to perform step if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we adopted these standards on september  and are currently assessing the impact that asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
asu is an update that addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations if the entity presents comparative financial statements and expands the required disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this standard is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition dates are on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted these standards on september   which will impact our financial disclosure for any business combinations entered into on or after september  in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  or asu asu is intended to result in convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  requirements for measurement of and disclosures about fair value 
the amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on companies applying us gaap 
key provisions of the amendment include a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value  except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity s net exposure to the group  an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets  and a requirement that for recurring level fair value measurements  entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements 
in addition  for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed  entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed

it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we early adopted these standards as of august  because asu impacts presentation only  it has no effect on our consolidated financial statements or on our financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment or asu  which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we do not expect the provisions of asu to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk per item e of regulation s k  information is not required
