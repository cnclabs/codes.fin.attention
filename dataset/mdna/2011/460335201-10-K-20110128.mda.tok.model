at the beginning of fiscal  entitlement for the nascar craftsman truck series had changed and became the nascar camping world truck series 
throughout this document  the naming convention for these series is consistent with the current branding 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses 
our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party  if any  has the power and benefits 
therefore  we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we  or another party  have the power to direct these activities 

table of contents we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 
revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar sprint cup and nationwide series schedules as well as the nascar camping world truck series schedule beginning in fiscal year event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event as a component of its sanction fees 
the promoter records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors 
ultimately  the promoter retains percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative fair value 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired including recognized intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar  grand american and indycar 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with asc  business combinations  are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 

table of contents interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin  and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets which could be subject to impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million as an impairment of long lived assets primarily attributable to the reduction of the carrying value of our staten island property and impairment charges relating to certain other long lived assets 
in fiscal we determined that certain costs related to the daytona development project which were capitalized are no longer expected to benefit the future development of the project 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash impairment totaling approximately million  consisting primarily of architecture and engineering  legal and associated capitalized interest 
the costs which continue to be capitalized on this project consist principally of land and land related improvements which are expected to provide benefits to the ongoing development 
as of november   goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment accounts for approximately  million  or percent of our total assets 
we account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc and for our long lived assets in accordance with asc we follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually 
we complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance  supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable 
in connection with our fiscal assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above 
we believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were appropriate  relevant  and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes 
our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units  except for one reporting unit that was recently acquired 
the estimated fair value for this one reporting unit  which has goodwill of less than million  exceeded the carrying value by less than percent as determined using our internal discounted cash flow methodology 
we believe recent comparable market transactions would support a substantially higher valuation 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future as further described in risk factors  our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations 
despite the current adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment  which have recently contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports events during fiscal  we believe there has been no significant change in the long term fundamentals of our ongoing motorsports event business 
we believe our present operational and cash flow outlook further support its conclusion 
in addition  our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities 
in these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee  which adds an additional element of risk that can adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
the carrying value of our equity investments was million at november  income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and 
table of contents liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc  income taxes 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
derivative instruments 
from time to time  we utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and locks to assist in managing our interest rate risk 
we do not enter into any interest rate swap or lock derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we account for the interest rate swaps and locks in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business  we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
equity and other investments hollywood casino at kansas speedway on december   kansas entertainment  llc  kansas entertainment a joint venture of penn hollywood kansas  inc penn  a subsidiary of penn national gaming  inc and kansas speedway development corporation ksdc  a wholly owned subsidiary of isc  was selected by the kansas lottery gaming facility review board to develop and operate a gaming facility in the northeast zone wyandotte county  kansas 
on february   kansas entertainment received the final approval under the kansas expanded lottery act  along with its gaming license from the kansas racing and gaming commission 
construction of the hollywood themed and branded entertainment destination facility  overlooking turn two of kansas speedway  began in april with a planned opening in the first half of the initial phase of this project  including certain changes to the scope and mix of gaming operations and amenities approved by the kansas lottery commission in august  features an  square foot casino with  slot machines and table games including poker tables  a  space parking structure as well as a sports themed bar  dining and entertainment options 
kansas entertainment anticipates funding the initial phase of the development with a mix of equity contributions from each partner as well third party financing  which it is currently pursuing 
ksdc and penn will share equally in the cost of developing and constructing the facility 
we currently estimate that our share of capitalized development costs for the project  excluding our contribution of the land  will be approximately million 
in addition  we expect to continue to incur certain other start up and related costs through opening  a number of which will be expensed through equity in net loss from equity investments 
penn is the managing member of kansas entertainment and will be responsible for the development and operation of the casino and hotel 
we have accounted for kansas entertainment as an equity investment in our financial statements as of november  and our percent portion of kansas entertainment s net loss in fiscal is approximately million  related to certain start up costs  and is included in equity in net loss from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
there were no operations included in our consolidated statements of operations in the same periods in fiscal or 
table of contents staten island property in connection with our efforts to develop a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area  our wholly owned indirect subsidiary  development  purchased a total of acres located in the new york city borough of staten island in early fiscal and began improvements including fill operations on the property 
in december  we announced our decision to discontinue pursuit of the speedway development on staten island 
in may  we entered into a consent order with the new york department of environmental conservation dec to resolve certain issues surrounding the fill operations and the prior placement of fill at the site that contained constituents above regulatory thresholds 
the consent order required us to remove non compliant fill pursuant to an approved comprehensive fill removal plan  and to pay a penalty to dec of  half of which was paid in may and the other half of which was suspended so long as we complied with the terms of the consent order 
during the second quarter of fiscal the dec notified us that it had complied with the terms of the consent order and that we had no further obligations under the consent order 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined  based on our understanding of the real estate market and the above transaction  that the current carrying value of the property was in excess of the fair market value 
as a result  we recognized a non cash  pre tax charge in our results of approximately million  or per diluted share  which is included in the motorsports event segment 
in october  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement agreement with kb marine holdings llc kb holdings under which kb holdings would acquire percent of the outstanding equity membership interests of development for a total purchase price of million 
upon execution of the agreement  isc received a non refundable million payment 
this transaction was scheduled to close by february  however  the closing was subject to certain conditions including kb holdings securing the required equity commitments to acquire the property and performing its obligation under the agreement 
kb holdings did not obtain resolution of certain issues relating to the fill permitting process which prevented it from obtaining funding and closing the agreement 
on september   we executed a second amendment to the agreement which provided an extension to kb holdings to close the transaction on or before november  under the terms of that extension  the purchase price to be paid by kb holdings was million  million of which  in non refundable deposits and cash  was to be received at or prior to closing  and million of which will be in the form of a promissory note payable on or before august  the promissory note would have had a market based interest rate and was to be secured by a first priority security interest in the outstanding equity membership interests of development 
we expected that the proceeds from the sale  net of applicable broker commissions and other closing costs would result in an immaterial gain or loss on the transaction upon closing 
on december   we announced the termination of the agreement with kb holdings for the sale of the staten island  new york property 
kb holdings did not fulfill the terms of the second amendment to the agreement to close the transaction on or before november  as a result of the transaction terminating  we are pursuing discussions with alternative buyers for the acre parcel of property located in staten island 
motorsports authentics we are partners with speedway motorsports  inc in a joint venture  smisc  llc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc conducts business under the name motorsports authentics 
ma designs  promotes  markets and distributes motorsports licensed merchandise 
in fiscal  ma management and ownership considered various approaches to optimize performance in ma s various distribution channels 
as the challenges were assessed  it became apparent that there was significant risk in future business initiatives in mass apparel  memorabilia and other yet to be developed products 
these initiatives had previously been deemed achievable and were included in projections that supported the carrying value of inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets on ma s balance sheet 
this analysis  combined with a long term macroeconomic outlook that was less robust than previously expected  triggered ma s review of certain assets under asc and asc and our evaluation under asc 
table of contents in the fiscal third quarter  ma  suffering financial stress from the recession  ceased paying certain guaranteed royalties under several license agreements where estimated royalties payable based on projected sales were less than stipulated guaranteed minimum royalties payable unearned royalties 
all earned royalties that were due have been paid 
ma had received notices from certain licensors alleging default under the license agreements should ma not pay unearned royalties within stipulated cure periods 
as a result of the foregoing which triggered the our evaluation performed under asc we recognized significant impairments of our equity investment in ma during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting in a reduction to the carrying value of our investment in ma to zero at november  ma s management  with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm  completed its review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  concluding that the fair value of ma s goodwill and intangible assets should be reduced to zero 
going into fiscal  ma management and ownership continued to explore business strategies in conjunction with certain motorsports industry stakeholders that allow the possibility for ma to operate profitably in the future 
as with any business in an adverse economic environment  management must find the optimal business model for long term viability 
in addition to revisiting the business vision for ma  management  with support of ownership  has undertaken certain initiatives to improve inventory controls and buying cycles  as well as implemented changes to make ma a more efficiently operated and profitable company 
we believe a revised ma business vision  which includes the successful resolution of license agreement terms and favorable license terms in the future  along with a focus on its core competencies  streamlined operations  reduced operating costs and inventory risk  are necessary for ma to survive as a profitable operation in the future 
in july  certain industry stakeholders created the nascar licensing trust trust that is represented by a board of directors that includes representatives from nascar  the sanctioning body  and from nascar teams 
under this new agreement  the trust brings a new structure to the licensing business that will be more efficient for the industry 
the benefit to the licensees is a more focused and streamlined licensing business that will reduce cost  foster more efficient administrative processes  and allow for more cohesive retail and marketing strategies 
the trust represents four key categories die cast  toys  apparel and trackside retail rights and grants the rights of any nascar driver that is participating in the licensing categories included in the trust 
the revenues will be distributed based on percentage of licensed sales and allocated according to actual earnings to each licensor 
this should allow the industry to more efficiently manage costs and increase revenues  while providing a wider selection of products for fans 
concurrent with the creation of the trust  ma management  ownership and industry stakeholders negotiated ma s release from future guaranteed minimum royalties as well as the current unearned guaranteed minimum royalties payable to nascar team licensors 
with respect to the one agreement secured by parent company guarantees  ma and the parent companies negotiated a settlement amount to eliminate future guaranteed minimum royalties 
as a result of the settlement  our remaining guaranty exposure  to one nascar team licensor  has been reduced to approximately million and will be satisfied upon ma making certain payments to the team through january in january  ma made a payment to the team effectively reducing our guaranty exposure to million 
while it is possible that some obligation under this guarantee may occur in the future  the amount we will ultimately pay cannot be estimated at this time 
in any event  we do not believe that the ultimate financial outcome will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we did not recognize any net income or loss from operations of ma during fiscal our percent portion of ma s fiscal net loss is approximately million  or per diluted share  which included the aforementioned impairment charges 
fiscal equity in net income from ma was approximately million  or per diluted share 
other equity investments our equity investments also include our percent limited partnership investment in stock car montreal lp prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest in february 
table of contents income taxes the tax treatment of providing a valuation allowance related to losses incurred by our motorsports authentics equity investment  partially offset by the reduction in income taxes due to the interest income related to our settlement with the internal revenue service  are the principal causes of the increased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  the de recognition of potential interest and penalties associated with certain state settlements as well as certain state credits accrued are the principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  as a result of the above items  our effective income tax rate increased from the statutory income rate to approximately percent for the fiscal year ended november   and decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately percent for the fiscal year ended november  current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
future trends in operating results economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  credit availability  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly the rise in unemployment and the decline in the consumer confidence index significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal certain of these trends have persisted through fiscal and are not expected to materially change in  which may have an impact on our business  especially attendance related and corporate partner revenues 
in response  we recently announced an initiative to lower our direct operating expenses  beginning in  by million to million in sustainable reductions through the streamlining of corporate services  optimization of event and ancillary business models  and process improvements that resulted in a reduction of workforce and operational costs 
these changes are expected to have a positive impact on our financial position 
admissions an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing closely on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities 
by effectively managing ticket prices and seating capacity  we can stimulate ticket renewals and advance sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual and forecasted inclement weather on ticket sales 
with any ticketing program  we first examine our pricing structure to ensure that prices are in line with market demand 
when determined necessary  as has been the case during this period of sustained economic downturn  we will adjust pricing on inventory 
while we have not had a sell out at any of our events since february  we have had capacity crowds at certain events 
we have also experienced a compressed sales cycle with our customers making their ticket purchasing decisions closer to the event date 
to address this and to be sensitive to the economic challenges that many of our fans face  in  we lowered prices on over  seats  or percent of our grandstand capacity  for nascar sprint cup events across the company 
for our events  we expanded our reduced pricing to approximately  seats throughout our facilities as well as unbundling a substantial number of tickets to better respond to consumer demand 
in addition to preferred pricing  we provided our customers that renew early various incentives as well as special access privileges 
we also created ticket packages that provide added value opportunities  making it more affordable for our fans to attend live events 
as we also want to develop the next generation motorsports fan  we expanded our youth initiative to encourage families to attend 
we believe  based on our research and analysis  our current pricing levels and initiatives going into the season are on target with demand  providing appropriate price points for all income levels 
also  based on consumer feedback  we will now provide single day ticket purchasing at kansas and chicagoland speedways for all of their events 
these facilities previously required purchasers to purchase season ticket packages for certain sanctioned racing events annually  under specified terms and conditions 

table of contents it is important that we maintain the integrity of our pricing model by rewarding our best and loyal customers 
we do not adjust pricing inside of the sales cycle and avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
further  we limit and monitor the availability of promotional tickets 
all of these factors could have a detrimental effect on our pricing model and long term value of our business 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
corporate partnerships with regard to corporate marketing partner relationships  we believe that our presence in key markets  impressive portfolio of events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial and help to mitigate adverse economic trends as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships 
due to the current economic conditions which began to deteriorate in the latter part of fiscal  extended throughout fiscal and persisted in fiscal  we have experienced a slowdown in corporate spending 
in addition  the process of securing sponsorship deals has become more time consuming as corporations are more closely scrutinizing their marketing budgets 
while these trends continue to impact sales  we are seeing encouraging signs of interest from corporate partners 
we expect  based on current interest and demand  to secure all of our nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event entitlements 
we continue to believe that revenues from our corporate marketing relationships will grow over the long term  contributing to strong earnings and cash flow stability and predictability 
television broadcast and ancillary media rights domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues are an important component of our revenue and earnings stream 
starting in  nascar entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its three national touring series sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck 
the agreements total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees were approximately million for and will be approximately million for the industry rights fees will increase  on average  by approximately three percent per year through the season 
the annual increase is expected to vary between two and four percent per year over the period 
fox and tnt have been strong supporters of nascar racing since  and both have played a major role in the sport s climb in popularity 
we have  and expect to continue to see  ongoing broadcast innovation in their coverage of nascar racing events 
also notable was the return of espn to the sport in  which it helped build throughout the s and s 
espn s coverage and weekly ancillary nascar related programming continues to promote the sport across various properties 
further  espn broadcasts substantially all of the nascar nationwide series  providing that series with the continuity and promotional support that we believe will allow it to flourish 
we were pleased with abc s decision to broadcast the majority of its nascar sprint cup series events on its cable channel  espn 
espn has a subscriber base at approximately million  while less than the networks  it does have  over the longer term  the ability to attract younger viewers as well as create more exposure for the sport 
also  cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to traditional networks  which is a potential benefit when nascar negotiates the next consolidated domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights contract 
while the media landscape continues to evolve  we continue to believe nascar s position in the sports and entertainment landscape remains strong 
it is expected that ratings will fluctuate year to year 
for the nascar season  television ratings for the nascar sprint cup series decreased to an average of million households and million viewers as reported by the nielsen company 
however  the long term ratings health of nascar sprint cup series events remains robust as it remains the second highest rated regular season sport on television and is the number two sport among all key demographic groups  trailing only the nfl 
in addition  the nascar nationwide series is the second highest rated motorsports series on television and the nascar camping world truck series is the third highest rated motorsports series on cable television 
these long term contracts provide significant cash flow visibility to us  race teams and nascar over the contract term 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted at our wholly owned facilities under these agreements  and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue  were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  
table of contents respectively 
operating income generated by these media rights were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are amounts equal to percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events  as part of prize and point fund money see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to materially decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
we anticipate any operating margin improvement to come primarily from economies of scale and controlling costs 
sanctioning bodies our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal nascar continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of nascar sprint cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
nascar has recently approved our request for realignment and beginning in  kansas speedway kansas will now host two nascar sprint cup series weekends 
we believe that these realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
capital improvements since we compete with newer entertainment venues for patrons and sponsors  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our facilities  thereby producing additional revenue opportunities and improving the event experience for our guests 
major examples of these efforts include fiscal we installed track lighting at chicagoland as well as improved certain electrical infrastructure in certain camping areas 
in addition to enhancing the guest experience  we now have the flexibility to run events later in the day in the event of inclement weather  we repaved darlington raceway darlington and constructed a tunnel in turn that provides improved access for fans and allows emergency vehicles to easily enter and exit the infield area of the track 
these collective projects mark the largest one time investment in the year history of the storied south carolina facility  we enhanced seating at michigan international speedway michigan to provide wider seats  seatbacks and more leg room for fans 
we also added incremental camping capacity and new shower restroom facilities for our on site overnight guests  as well as installed a state of the art foot  three sided led scoreboard for fans to more easily follow the on track competition 
finally  we added additional branded way finding signage to help pedestrians  motorists and campers find their way in  out and around the  acre racetrack property  and we constructed new media centers at watkins glen international watkins glen and homestead miami speedway homestead  which we believe increased appeal to media content providers  sports journalists  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in the motorsports industry 

table of contents fiscal we constructed a new media center at michigan as part of the terrace suite redevelopment project which we believe has increased appeal to media content providers  sports journalists  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in the motorsports industry  to further enhance our guest experience  we reconfigured tram and pedestrian routes at richmond international raceway richmond  built a new tram stop at daytona international speedway daytona  and  replaced the seats in the lower grandstands at talladega superspeedway talladega  and we have constructed a new leader board at homestead  which is the prototype for future tracks 
fiscal we made further grandstand enhancements at michigan to provide wider seats  seatbacks and more leg room for fans  we completed our repaving project at daytona 
in addition  we made frontstretch fan improvements and superstretch hospitality improvements at daytona which included the addition of the superstretch fan zone and improved tram infrastructure  and we constructed a new mile flat track facility which hosted successful ama motorcycle events  we completed a major seat enhancement project at talladega by installing new wider stadium style seats and increased leg room  and we have constructed a new state of the art led leader board and video screens at richmond 
we anticipate modest capital spending on other projects for maintenance  safety and regulatory requirements  as well as for preserving the guest experience at our events to enable us to effectively compete with other sports venues for consumer and corporate spending 
growth strategies our growth strategies also include exploring ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions and external developments that offer attractive financial returns 
this has been demonstrated through the planned real estate development joint venture to develop and operate a hollywood themed and branded entertainment destination facility overlooking turn two of kansas speedway

postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events we promote outdoor motorsports entertainment events 
weather conditions affect sales of  among other things  tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at these events 
poor weather conditions prior to an event  or even the forecast of poor weather conditions  could have a negative impact on us  particularly for walk up ticket sales to events which are not sold out in advance 
if an event scheduled for one of our facilities is delayed or postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in the united states following the september  terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we would incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including any live broadcast revenues  associated with the event to the extent such losses were not covered by insurance

we believe that unprecedented adverse economic trends  particularly the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal  an indycar series event held at richmond and a nascar camping world truck series event held at auto club speedway in fiscal were not held in fiscal offsetting this was a nascar camping world truck series event held at darlington in fiscal that was not held in fiscal  in fiscal  we recognized non cash impairments of long lived assets totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  primarily attributable to certain costs related to the daytona development project which were capitalized that are no longer expected to benefit the future development of the project

this de recognition of interest and penalties was recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
admissions revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the decrease was driven by lower attendance attributable to ongoing adverse economic conditions as well as inclement weather and a decrease in our weighted average ticket price for certain events associated with the previously discussed value pricing initiatives 
motorsports related revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is substantially attributable to decreases in sponsorship  suite and hospitality revenues for certain events 
to a lesser extent  contributing to change was the aforementioned camping world truck series event not being held at auto club speedway  and the indycar event not being held at richmond  respectively 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in television broadcast and ancillary rights 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is substantially attributable to the previously discussed lower attendance 
prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in overall prize and point fees paid for the events held in the period as compared to the same period in prior year 
partially offsetting overall decreases are the increases in television broadcast rights fees for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events during the periods as standard nascar sanctioning agreements require a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees to be paid to competitors 
partially offsetting the decrease was the aforementioned camping world truck series event held at darlington that was not held in fiscal motorsports related expense decreased by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced promotional  advertising and other race related expenses during the period as a result of focused cost containment 
contributing to the decrease was aforementioned indycar series event that was not held at richmond in fiscal that was held in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by the aforementioned camping world truck series event held at darlington added to the schedule in motorsports related expenses as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue increased slightly to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for the same period in the prior year 
the slight margin decrease is primarily due to the previously discussed lower admissions and motorsports related revenue during the period 
food  beverage and merchandise expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to variable costs associated with the lower sales of merchandise and concessions  as well as catering 
food  beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food  beverage and merchandise revenue increased slightly to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for the same period in the prior year 
the slight margin decrease was primarily attributable to the ratio of fixed to variable costs 
general and administrative expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal we incurred approximately million of costs related to organizational and structural changes in connection with the company wide 
table of contents initiative to reduce future operational costs 
offsetting this amount were ongoing cost containment initiatives that were put in place in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal the slight margin decrease is primarily due to the previously discussed decrease in revenues  largely offset by our cost containment efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is predominately attributable to our headquarters building see future liquidity which was put in service in the last month of fiscal partially offsetting the increases are certain assets which have reached the end of their useful lives 
the impairment of long lived assets of approximately million is primarily attributable to the aforementioned non cash impairment of certain costs related to the daytona development project and removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 
interest income and other decreased by approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower interest rates as compared to the same periods in the prior year 
interest expense decreased by approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the funding of the million principal percent senior notes maturity in april and the lower average outstanding balance on our credit facility as compared to the same period in the prior year 
partially offsetting the decrease is the interest on the term loan for our new headquarters building 
interest rate swap expense increased by approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the termination of the interest rate swap and the reduction of the anticipated debt issuance from million to million during the fiscal year ended november  loss on early redemption of debt of approximately million in fiscal is attributable to the aforementioned partial redemption of the million principal percent senior notes maturing in see future liquidity long term obligations and commitments 
there is no comparable amount in fiscal equity in net loss from equity investments represents our percent equity investments in motorsports authentics and hollywood casino at kansas speedway see equity and other investments 
the equity in net loss from equity investments of approximately million in fiscal relates to certain start up costs related to the hollywood casino at kansas speedway 
there were no comparable costs in fiscal we did not recognize any net loss from operations of motorsports authentics in fiscal as compared to an approximate net loss of million in fiscal our effective income tax rate decreased from approximately percent to approximately percent during fiscal compared to fiscal see income taxes 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal the comparison of fiscal to fiscal is impacted by the following factors economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  and the rise in unemployment  began to manifest in early fiscal and have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal  
table of contents further impacting the comparability of the periods were strong consumer and corporate sales for the th running of the daytona in fiscal this monumental anniversary of the great american race provided significant unique opportunities to drive attendance and revenue above the otherwise strong appeal of this marquee event and the sport of nascar in general  on february   we acquired the percent ownership interest in stock car montreal lp we did not previously own  bringing our ownership to percent 
this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the operations of stock car montreal lp are included in our consolidated operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
prior to this date  we had accounted for their operations as part of equity in net loss from equity investments 
a nascar nationwide series and a grand american series event were held at stock car montreal during the third quarter of fiscal  due to the acquisition of grand american by nascar in october  expenses related to prize  point and sanction fees are reported as part of prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees on the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year while reported as part of motorsports related expense in fiscal and prior years  during fiscal  approximately million  or per diluted share  of depreciation was accelerated above our normal depreciation rates relating to our prior office building in daytona beach  florida which is expected to be razed as part of our daytona development project see further discussion in future liquidity 
during fiscal  depreciation was accelerated above our normal depreciation rates relating to this prior office building and certain other offices and buildings which were razed in fiscal as part of our daytona development project totaling approximately million  or per diluted share 
these amounts were calculated by taking the remaining net book values of the respective offices and buildings and systematically reducing the net book values over their remaining useful lives based on the last date of occupancy and or the razing of the structure s  in fiscal  we recognized non cash impairments of long lived assets totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the carrying value of our staten island property and  to a much lesser extent  impairments of certain other long lived assets 
in fiscal  we recognized impairments of long lived assets totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  primarily attributable to our staten island property and impairments of certain other long lived assets  during fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge totaling approximately million  or per diluted share  to correct the carrying value amount of certain other assets  for which there was no comparable amortization in the prior year 
this adjustment was recorded in interest income and other in the consolidated statement of operations  during fiscal  we recognized interest rate swap expense of approximately million  or per diluted share  related to our interest rate swap for which there was no comparable expense in the prior year see future liquidity 
this expense was recorded in interest rate swap expense in the consolidated statement of operations  in fiscal  the million  or per diluted share  equity in net loss from equity investments represents our portion of the results from our percent indirect interest in motorsports authentics and includes the previously discussed non cash impairment charge of approximately million  or per diluted share see equity and other investments 
our portion of motorsports authentics net income for fiscal included in equity in net loss from equity investments was approximately million  or per diluted share  and during fiscal we recognized interest income net of tax  of approximately million  or per diluted share  in our income tax expense as a result of the settlement with the internal revenue service 
admissions revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the decrease was primarily attributable to the decreases in attendance due to previously discussed adverse economic trends including decreases in weighted average ticket prices as a result of pricing strategies for our nascar sprint cup events in see future trends in operating results 
these decreases were further impacted by the strong demand for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona in fiscal the overall decrease in attendance was partially offset by the consolidation of the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and a slight increase in the weighted average ticket prices for certain events conducted during speedweeks at daytona in fiscal 
table of contents motorsports related revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decreases in sponsorship  suite and hospitality revenues for certain events conducted during the year  which we believe result largely from the previously discussed adverse economic conditions 
to a lesser extent  lower track rentals  advertising and ancillary rights revenues also contributed to the decrease 
partially offsetting the decrease was the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and an increase in television broadcast rights for our nascar sprint cup  nationwide  and camping world truck series events 
food  beverage and merchandise revenue decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to previously discussed adverse economic conditions impacting attendance as well as lower per capita sales in fiscal affecting catering  concessions and merchandise sales 
in addition  the decrease was impacted by the strong sales of the daytona th anniversary product in fiscal the decrease was slightly offset by the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal 
prize and point fund monies and nascar sanction fees increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to the nationwide series event at stock car montreal and the previously discussed increase in television broadcast rights fees for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted during the year  as standard nascar sanctioning agreements require that a specific percentage of television broadcast rights fees be paid to competitors 
to a lesser extent  increased nascar sanction fees  as well as the aforementioned reclassification of amounts related to grand american in fiscal contributed to the increase 
motorsports related expense decreased by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was predominately attributable to reduced promotional  advertising and other race related expenses during the period as a result of focused cost containment initiatives as well as higher promotional and advertising expenses for the th running of the daytona in fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was the nationwide series event weekend at stock car montreal and to a lesser extent  the aforementioned reclassification of amounts related to grand american competition costs in fiscal motorsports related expense as a percentage of combined admissions and motorsports related revenue was comparable to the prior year  with the slight margin decrease primarily due to the previously discussed lower admissions and motorsports related revenues  as well as the aforementioned stock car montreal events conducted in the third quarter of fiscal  largely offset by initiatives to reduce costs 
food  beverage and merchandise expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to variable costs associated with the lower sales of merchandise  catering and concessions sales related to the previously discussed decreases in attendance 
in addition  the decrease was impacted by the robust sales attributable to the previously discussed events conducted during speedweeks at daytona supporting the th running of the sold out daytona in fiscal food  beverage and merchandise expense as a percentage of food  beverage and merchandise revenue increased to approximately percent in fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal economies of scale and the ratio of fixed to variable costs attributed to the decrease in margin 
this is especially evident for fiscal speedweeks sales as compared to strong sales surrounding the th running of the daytona in fiscal the decrease in margin was partially offset by certain fixed cost reductions during the year 
general and administrative expense decreased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal driven by focused cost containment initiatives  we reduced legal fees  other professional fees  personnel related and various other costs associated with our ongoing business compared to the prior year 
in addition the decrease was impacted by an adjustment to certain other taxes in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to approximately percent for fiscal  as compared to percent for fiscal the slight margin decrease was primarily due to the previously discussed decrease in revenues  largely offset by our cost containment efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to capital expenditures for our ongoing facility enhancements and related initiatives 
the impairment of long lived assets of approximately million in fiscal is primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the carrying value of our staten island property and  to a much lesser extent  certain other long lived asset impairments 

table of contents the fiscal impairment consisted primarily of costs associated with the fill removal process at our staten island property and impairments of certain other long lived assets 
interest income and other increased by approximately million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was almost entirely due to the aforementioned non cash charge of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  to correct the carrying value of certain other assets 
slightly offsetting the increase were lower interest rates on higher cash balances as compared to the same period in the prior year 
interest expense increased by approximately million  or percent  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher average borrowings on our credit facility during the year see discussion under liquidity and capital resources general as compared to the same period in fiscal  partially offset by the repayment of the million principal percent senior notes in april interest rate swap expense was approximately million during fiscal attributable to interest rate swap agreement which was amended and re designated in february there was no comparable expense in fiscal equity in net loss from equity investments represents our percent equity investment in motorsports authentics see equity and other investments 
our effective income tax rate increased from approximately percent to percent during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the tax treatment associated with income earned in fiscal and losses incurred in fiscal by motorsports authentics 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the effective income tax rate due to the interest income related to the settlement with the internal revenue service 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources general we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities  and return of capital through payments of an annual cash dividend and repurchase of our shares under our stock purchase plan 
in addition  we have used the proceeds from offerings of our class a common stock  the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects 
at november   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million  million principal amount of senior notes outstanding  million in borrowings on our million revolving credit facility  a debt service funding commitment of approximately million principal amount related to the taxable special obligation revenue tif bonds issued by the unified government of wyandotte county kansas city  kansas unified government million principal term loan related to our headquarters office building the international motorsports center  or imc  and million principal amount of other third party debt

in addition  as of november   we have approximately million available to draw upon under our newly negotiated year revolving credit facility  if needed 
see future liquidity for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity 
as it relates to capital allocation  our top priority is fan and competitor safety as well as regulatory compliance 
in addition  we remain focused on driving incremental earnings by improving the fan experience with certain upgrades to our facilities to increase ticket sales 
we will also focus on maintaining modest debt levels 

table of contents beyond that  we are also making investments in strategic projects that complement our core business and provide value for our shareholders 
those options include acquisitions  new market development  ancillary real estate development  and share repurchases

future liquidity general as discussed in future trends in operating results  economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  credit availability  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly the rise in unemployment and the decline in consumer confidence significantly contributed to the decrease in attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during fiscal certain of these trends have persisted throughout 
table of contents fiscal this will negatively impact year over year comparability for most all of our revenue categories for the full year  with the exception of domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees 
our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments  any equity contributions in connection with the kansas hotel and casino development  any potential payments associated with our keepwell agreements  and payments for share repurchases under our stock purchase plan 
we remain interested in pursuing further acquisition and or development opportunities that would increase shareholder value 
the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  over the longer term we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors 
in addition to local  national  and global economic and financial market conditions  consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow

speedway developments in light of nascar s publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the nascar sprint cup series schedule  we believe there are still potential development opportunities for public private partnerships in new  underserved markets across the country  which could include denver  colorado  the northwest us and the new york metropolitan area 
daytona development project we are exploring development of a mixed use entertainment destination development on acres located directly across international speedway boulevard from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility

the imc was financed in july through a million construction term loan obtained by our wholly owned subsidiary  which was created to own and operate the office building 
approved land use entitlements for the remaining project allow for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area  plus a hotel  residential and additional office space

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap and lock agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps and locks are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate as well as to lock in certain rates for future debt issuances 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we had approximately million of variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately million 
at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates 
table of contents would be approximately million at november  credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
