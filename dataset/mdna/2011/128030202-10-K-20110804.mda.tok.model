item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities 
market prices of wholesale shell eggs are volatile and changes in these prices and costs can adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
as a result  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
small increases in production or small decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices 
shell egg prices trended upward from calendar until late and early when they rose to historical highs 
in the early fall of calendar  the demand trend related to the increased popularity of high protein diets faded dramatically and prices fell 
during the time of increased demand  the egg industry had geared up to produce more eggs  resulting in an oversupply of eggs 
since calendar  supplies appear to be more closely balanced with demand and egg prices again reached record levels during and egg prices have since retreated from those record price levels due to small increases in industry supply 
there can be no assurance that shell egg prices will remain at or near current levels or that the supply of and demand for shell eggs will remain level in the future 
in general  a increase or decrease in industry supply will translate into a corresponding change in shell egg prices 
retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
changes in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business 
we believe that fast food restaurant consumption  reports from the medical community regarding the health benefits of shell eggs  reduced shell egg cholesterol levels  high protein diet trends and industry advertising campaigns have all contributed to shell egg demand 
however  there can be no assurance that the demand for shell eggs will not decline in the future 
adverse publicity relating to health concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional value of shell eggs  as well as movement away from high protein diets  could adversely affect demand for shell eggs  which would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
feed costs are volatile and changes in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations 
feed cost represents the largest element of our shell egg production farm cost  ranging from to of total farm production cost in the last five years 
although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources  we have little  if any  control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase  which are affected by weather and by various supply and demand factors 
increases in feed costs not accompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
alternatively  low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction  possibly resulting in lower egg prices 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  our financial results from year to year may fluctuate 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
we purchase approximately of the shell eggs we sell from outside producers and our ability to obtain such eggs at prices and in quantities acceptable to us could fluctuate 
we produce approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us and purchase the remaining amount from outside producers 
as the wholesale price for shell eggs increases  our cost to acquire shell eggs from outside producers also increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire shell eggs from outside producers in quantities and prices that are satisfactory and our inability to do so may have a material adverse affect on our business and profitability 
our acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks 
we plan to continue to pursue a growth strategy  which includes acquisitions of other companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs 
acquisitions can require capital resources and divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct prior to our acquisition of a business that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
we may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we had anticipated at the time of its purchase 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  or can successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of any acquired business 
no assurance can be given that companies acquired by us in the future will contribute positively to our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  federal anti trust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance 
the consideration we pay in connection with any acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we pay cash  we could be required to use a portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisition 
to the extent we issue shares of our common stock  existing stockholders may be diluted 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt 
our largest customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume 
accordingly  our business may be adversely affected by the loss of  or reduced purchases by  one or more of our large customers 
for the fiscal years   and  two affiliated customers  wal mart stores and sam s clubs  on a combined basis  accounted for   and of our net sales dollars  respectively 
for fiscal years and  publix super markets  inc  accounted for and of net sales dollars  respectively 
for fiscal years   and  our top ten customers accounted for   and of net sales dollars during those periods 
we have established long term relationships with most of our customers  who continue to purchase from us based on our ability to service their needs 
if  for any reason  one or more of our larger customers were to purchase significantly less of our shell eggs in the future or were to terminate their purchases from us  and we are not able to sell our shell eggs to new customers at comparable levels  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations  including environmental regulations  could harm our operating results  financial condition and reputation 
further  we may incur significant costs to comply with any such regulations 
we are subject to federal and state regulations relating to grading  quality control  labeling  sanitary control and waste disposal 
as a fully integrated shell egg producer  our shell egg facilities are subject to usda and fda regulation  as well as regulation by various state and local health and agricultural agencies 
our shell egg processing facilities are subject to periodic usda inspections 
all of our shell egg and feed mill facilities are subject to fda regulation and inspections 
our operations and facilities are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use  transportation  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
under these laws and regulations  we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities  including  but not limited to wastewater discharge permits 
if we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation  or fail to obtain any necessary permits  we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions  our reputation could be harmed and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future 
shell eggs and shell egg products are susceptible to microbial contamination  and we may be required to or voluntarily recall contaminated products 
shell eggs and shell egg products are vulnerable to contamination by pathogens  which are naturally occurring disease producing organisms such as salmonella 
shipment of contaminated products  even if inadvertent  may result in a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies 
in addition  products purchased from other producers may contain contaminants that may be inadvertently redistributed by us 
as such  we may decide or be required to recall a product if we or regulators believe it poses a potential health risk 
for example  in fiscal  there were two separate occasions where we voluntarily recalled shell eggs that we had purchased from other producers 
none of the recalled eggs were produced at cal maine facilities 
we do not maintain insurance to cover recall losses 
recall costs in fiscal were not material  but there is no guarantee that future costs will not be 
any product recall could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products  which could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is highly competitive 
the production and sale of fresh shell eggs  which have accounted for virtually all of our net sales in recent years  is intensely competitive 
we compete with a large number of competitors that may prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling shell eggs 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any or all of these companies 
in addition  increased competition could result in price reductions  greater cyclicality  reduced margins and loss of market share  which would negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
pressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices and protect our image with our customers 
we and many of our customers are facing pressure from animal rights groups  such as people for the ethical treatment of animals  or peta  and the humane society of the united states  to require that any companies that supply food products operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed by these animal rights groups 
as a result  we are reviewing and changing our operating procedures with respect to our flock of hens to meet some or all of these treatment standards 
the treatment standards require  among other things  that we provide increased cage space for our hens and modify beak trimming and forced molting practices the act of putting chickens into a regeneration cycle 
these groups have made legislative efforts to ban any form of caged housing in various states 
changing our procedures and infrastructure to conform to these guidelines has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs to our internal production of shell eggs  including cost increases from housing and feeding the increased flock population resulting from the modification of molting practices  and the cost for us to purchase shell eggs from our outside suppliers 
while some of these increased costs have been passed on to our customers  we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to pass on these costs  or any additional costs we will face  in the future 
on july   the humane society of the united states hsus and the united egg producers uep reached an agreement to work together toward the enactment of comprehensive new federal legislation for all million hens involved in us egg production 
the two groups will jointly ask congress for federal legislation  which would require egg producers to increase the space per bird in a tiered phase in  with the amount of space birds are given increasing  in intervals  over the next to years 
currently  the majority of birds are each provided square inches of space  with roughly million receiving square inches 
the proposed phase in would culminate with hens nationwide being provided a minimum of square inches of space  along with certain other improvements noted in the july  agreement 
if this federal legislation is passed we could incur significant costs to conform our operations to meet the requirements of this proposed legislation 
we do not have a current estimate of what these costs will be if this legislation is passed 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may adversely affect the implementation of our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our senior management team  including fred r 
adams  jr  our chairman 
the loss or interruption of mr 
adams services or those of one or more of our other executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations effectively and or pursue our growth strategy 
we have not entered into any employment or non compete agreements with any of our executive officers nor do we carry any significant key man life insurance on any such persons 
agricultural risks could harm our business 
our shell egg production activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
unusual or extreme weather conditions  disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs we produce and distribute 
if a substantial portion of our production facilities are affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are controlled by a principal stockholder 
fred r 
adams  jr  our chairman of the board  and his spouse own of the outstanding shares of our common stock  which has one vote per share 
in addition  mr 
adams owns and his son in law  adolphus b 
baker  our president  chief executive officer and director  owns of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock  which has ten votes per share 
mr 
baker and his spouse also own of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  currently mr 
adams and his spouse possess  and messrs 
adams and baker and their spouses collectively possess  of the total voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock 
these stockholdings include shares of our common stock accumulated under our employee stock ownership plan for the respective accounts of messrs 
adams and baker 
the adams family intends to retain ownership of a sufficient amount of common stock and class a common stock to assure its continued ownership of over of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock 
such ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of us more difficult and discourage certain types of transactions involving a change of control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation require that our class a common stock be issued only to fred r 
adams  jr 
and members of his immediate family  and that if shares of our class a common stock  by operation of law or otherwise  are deemed not to be owned by mr 
adams or a member of his immediate family  the voting power of any such shares shall be automatically reduced to one vote per share 
the adams family s controlling ownership of our capital stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
based on mr 
adams beneficial ownership of our outstanding capital stock  we are a controlled company  as defined in rule c of the listing standards of the nasdaq global market on which our shares of common stock are quoted 
accordingly  we are exempt from certain requirements of nasdaq s corporate governance listing standards  including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and the nomination of directors by independent directors 
current and any future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and although we believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters  we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
for example  we are currently the subject of several antitrust lawsuits  as further described in item below  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
such lawsuits are expensive to defend  divert management s attention  and may result in significant judgments 
legal proceedings may also expose us to negative publicity  which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference for our products and brands 
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently should certain impairment indicators arise 
as of may   we had million of goodwill 
while we believe that the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired  any future goodwill impairment charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period or our net worth 
the loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us 
we utilize intellectual property in our business 
for example  we own the trade names farmhouse  rio grande  sunups  sunny meadows and grain 
we also produce and market egg land s best under license agreements with eb 
we have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands 
the loss or expiration of any of our intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us by allowing our competitors to make and sell products that are substantially similar to those we offer 
this could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell the associated products  thereby adversely affecting our operations

item legal proceedings chicken litter litigation cal maine farms  inc is presently a defendant in two personal injury cases in the circuit court of washington county  arkansas 
those cases are styled  mcwhorter vs 
alpharma  inc  et al  and carroll  et al 
vs 
alpharma  inc  et al 
cal maine farms  inc 
was named as a defendant in the mcwhorter case on february  it was named as a defendant in the carroll case on may  co defendants in both cases include other integrated poultry companies such as tyson foods  inc  cargill  incorporated  george s farms  inc  peterson farms  inc  simmons foods  inc  and simmons poultry farms  inc 
the manufacturers of an additive for broiler feed are also included as defendants 
those defendants are alpharma  inc and alpharma animal health  co 
both cases allege that the plaintiffs have suffered medical problems resulting from living near land upon which litter from the defendants flocks was spread as fertilizer 
the mcwhorter case focuses on mold and fungi allegedly created by the application of litter  and seeks unspecified damages 
the carroll case also alleges injury from mold and fungi  but focuses primarily on the broiler feed ingredient as the cause of the alleged medical injuries  and seeks unspecified damages 
no trial date for either the carroll or mcwhorter case has been set 
several other separate  but related  cases were prosecuted in the same venue by the same attorneys 
the same theories of liability were prosecuted in all of the cases 
no cal maine company was named as a defendant in any of those other cases 
the plaintiffs selected one of those cases  green  et al 
vs 
alpharma  inc  et al  as a bellwether case to go to trial first 
all of the poultry defendants were granted summary judgment in the green case in in  however  the arkansas supreme court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the poultry defendants and remanded the case for trial 
the case was retried with a complete defendants verdict  and that verdict was upheld by the arkansas supreme court 
the plaintiffs intentions with regard to the other lawsuits  including mcwhorter and carroll are not presently known 
we are not able at present to give an opinion regarding the ultimate resolution of mcwhorter and carroll  but the outlook appears favorable 
state of oklahoma watershed pollution litigation on june   the state of oklahoma filed suit  in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma  against a number of companies  including cal maine foods  inc and cal maine farms  inc we and cal maine farms filed our joint answer and motion to dismiss the suit on october  the state of oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the illinois river watershed 
this watershed provides water to eastern oklahoma 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages  but the claim for monetary damages has been dismissed on motion by the court 
the parties participated in a series of mediation meetings without success 
cal maine foods  inc no longer operates in the watershed 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that cal maine foods  inc will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief unless the court orders substantial affirmative remediation 
cal maine foods  inc owns of benton county foods  llc  which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the illinois river watershed 
benton county foods  llc is not a defendant in the litigation 
the trial in the case has been conducted 
the trial began in september  and concluded in february the case was tried to the court without a jury 
we are awaiting a ruling from the court 
we are not able at present to give an opinion regarding the ultimate resolution of the action 
mississippi wage and hour litigation on august   a former mississippi employee of cal maine farms  inc filed a wage and hour claim alleging that he was wrongfully denied overtime pay for work in excess of forty hours per week seeking recovery of overtime wages not paid  liquidated damages equal to overtime wages not paid  and attorney s fees 
in its present posture  the case is a single employee action 
the plaintiff has  however  requested that he be considered a representative employee and that the case be expanded to cover all similarly situated employees and former employees 
the controlling statutory and regulatory framework of the fair labor standards act make it plain that the former employee was an agricultural worker  and that  accordingly  he was not entitled to overtime pay 
the case was filed in state court and immediately removed to the us district court for the southern district of mississippi 
a motion to dismiss has been filed on behalf of cal maine farms  inc the court has stayed all proceedings in this case pending resolution of that motion 
we are not able at present to give an opinion regarding the ultimate resolution of the action 
egg antitrust litigation since september   the company has been named as one of several defendants in twenty four antitrust cases involving the united states shell egg industry 
in sixteen of these cases  the named plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated 
in fourteen of those putative class actions  the named plaintiffs allege that they are retailers or distributors that purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants 
in the other two putative class actions  the named plaintiffs are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products indirectly from one or more of the defendants that is  they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties 
in the remaining eight cases  the plaintiffs sued for their own alleged damages and are not seeking to certify a class 
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated all of the putative class actions as well as certain other cases in which the company was not a named defendant for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the pennsylvania court has organized the putative class actions around two groups direct purchasers and indirect purchasers and has named interim lead counsel for the named plaintiffs in each group 
six of the eight non class suits were filed in the same court that is presiding over the putative class actions 
one of these cases was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiff 
another of these cases was filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania  but the defendants have transferred it to the eastern district  and it has been consolidated for pretrial proceedings with the other cases 
the remaining non class suit was filed in the district court of wyandotte county  kansas 
the defendants removed this case to the united states district court for the district of kansas and then requested that it be transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania and consolidated with the multidistrict litigation proceedings in that court 
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation granted that transfer request  and the case has now been consolidated in the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the plaintiffs in this action have filed a motion to remand the case back to the district court of wyandotte county  kansas  but that motion has not been decided 
the direct purchaser putative class action 
the named plaintiffs in the direct purchaser case filed a consolidated complaint on january  on april   the company filed motions to dismiss the direct purchasers consolidated complaint 
the direct purchaser plaintiffs did not respond to those motions 
instead  the direct purchaser plaintiffs announced a potential settlement with one defendant 
the final hearing on approval of that settlement has been held  but the court has not yet ruled 
if it is approved  the settlement would not require the settling party to pay any money 
instead  the settling defendant  while denying all liability  would provide cooperation in the form of documents and witness interviews to the plaintiffs attorneys 
after announcing this potential settlement with one defendant  the direct purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on december  on february   the company joined with other defendants in moving to dismiss the direct purchaser plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations period and claims arising from a supposed conspiracy in the egg products sector 
the court heard oral argument on these motions but has not yet ruled 
on february   the company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the direct purchaser plaintiffs amended complaint 
on june   the direct purchaser plaintiffs announced a potential settlement with a second defendant 
the final hearing on approval of this settlement has also been held  but the court has not ruled 
if this settlement is approved  then the defendant would pay a total of million and would provide other consideration in the form of documents  witness interviews  and declarations 
this settling defendant denied all liability in its potential agreement with the direct purchaser plaintiffs and stated publicly that it settled merely to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation 
the indirect purchaser putative class action 
the named plaintiffs in the indirect purchaser case filed a consolidated complaint on february  on april   the company filed motions to dismiss the indirect purchasers consolidated complaint 
the indirect purchaser plaintiffs did not respond to those motions 
instead  the indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on april  on may   the company joined with other defendants in moving to dismiss the indirect purchaser plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations period  claims arising from a supposed conspiracy in the egg products sector  claims arising under certain state antitrust and consumer frauds statutes  and common law claims for unjust enrichment 
the court heard oral argument on these motions but has not yet ruled 
on june   the company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the indirect purchaser plaintiffs amended complaint 
the non class cases 
the cases in which plaintiffs do not seek to certify a class were filed between november  and january  the company has not yet answered or moved to dismiss any of these cases 
allegations in each case 
in all of the cases described above  the plaintiffs allege that the company and certain other large domestic egg producers conspired to reduce the domestic supply of eggs in a concerted effort to raise the price of eggs to artificially high levels 
in each case  plaintiffs allege that all defendants agreed to reduce the domestic supply of eggs by a manipulating egg exports and b implementing industry wide animal welfare guidelines that reduced the number of hens and eggs 
both groups of named plaintiffs in the putative class actions seek treble damages and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and all other putative class members in the united states 
both groups of named plaintiffs in the putative class actions allege a class period starting on january  and running through the present 
the direct purchaser putative class action case alleges two separate sub classes one for direct purchasers of shell eggs and one for direct purchasers of egg products 
the direct purchaser putative class action case seeks relief under the sherman act 
the indirect purchaser putative class action case seeks relief under the sherman act and the statutes and common law of various states  the district of columbia  and puerto rico 
in six of the non class cases  the plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under the sherman act 
in one of the non class cases  the plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief under the sherman act and the ohio antitrust act known as the valentine act 
in the remaining non class case  the plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under the kansas restraint of trade act 
the pennsylvania court has entered a series of orders in the putative class actions related to case management and scheduling 
there is no definite schedule in either putative class action case for discovery  class certification proceedings  or filing motions for summary judgment 
no trial date has been set in either putative class action case 
the non class cases were filed so recently that the court has not set any schedule for them 
the company intends to continue to defend these cases as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the company believes are meritorious and provable 
florida civil investigative demand on november   the company received an antitrust civil investigative demand from the attorney general of the state of florida 
the demand seeks production of documents and responses to interrogatories relating to the production and sale of eggs and egg products 
the company is cooperating with this investigation and expects to provide responsive information 
no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the company in this matter

in addition  because the following discussion includes numerous forward looking statements relating to us  our results of operations  financial condition and business  reference is made to the information set forth in the section of part i immediately preceding item above under the caption forward looking statements 
overview cal maine foods  inc we  us  our  or the company is primarily engaged in the production  grading  packaging  marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was may  weeks  may  weeks  and may  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow and maintain flocks of pullets young female chickens  usually under weeks of age  layers mature female chickens and breeders male or female birds used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks  manufacture feed  and produce  process and distribute shell eggs and egg products 
we are the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the united states 
we market the majority of our shell eggs in states  primarily in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western  and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
we market our shell eggs through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers  including national and regional grocery store chains  club stores  foodservice distributors  and egg product manufacturers 
our operating results are directly tied to egg prices  which are highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations  and are outside of our control 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
shorter term  retail sales of shell eggs historically have been greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
our need for working capital generally is highest in the last and first fiscal quarters ending in may and august  respectively  when egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas  and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
because of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
for fiscal  we used contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we own the shell eggs produced under these arrangements 
for fiscal  approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us was purchased from outside producers for resale 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs 
for fiscal  feed costs averaged about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in market prices for corn and soybean meal  the primary ingredients of the feed we use  result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of our feed ingredients  which are commodities  are subject to factors over which we have little or no control such as volatile price changes caused by weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs  demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the corn and soybean crops were large for the crop year  however  national inventories of both commodities are expected to be at very low levels as the crop year comes to a close 
feed ingredient prices have continued to increase sharply since july market prices for corn have risen  in part  due to increases in export demand and increases in demand from ethanol producers 
market prices for soybean meal remain high because of competition for planted acres for other grain production 
the prospective outlook is for feed costs to remain high and increasingly volatile in the year ahead 
the purchase of tampa farms  llc described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is referred to below as the acquisition 
to increase comparability in the results of operations comparison between fiscal and fiscal  the exclusion of the acquisition refers to the exclusion of the fiscal first and second quarter results of operations for tampa farms  llc  because tampa farms  llc was not acquired until the third quarter of fiscal we also acquired zephyr egg  llc during the first quarter of fiscal  which is described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  since zephyr egg  llc s results of operations are included in all four quarters of fiscal and fiscal  there was no adjustment necessary in the results of operations comparisons for these periods for that acquisition

lower egg prices followed  and we experienced net losses in fiscal and beginning in the latter part of fiscal  egg supplies appeared to become more aligned with demand 
since that time  the supply demand balance has tightened 
tighter supplies resulted in increased prices in fiscal  and prices reached record levels in fiscal these increased prices resulted in significantly improved profitability

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at may  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at may  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of the affiliates 
goodwill 
at may   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the following fiscal period description amount acquisition of hudson brothers  inc acquisition of hillandale farms  llc acquisition of green forest foods  llc revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale acquisition of zephyr egg  llc acquisition of tampa farms  llc revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale total goodwill goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have only one operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level 
significant adverse industry or economic changes  or other factors not anticipated could result in an impairment charge to reduce recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain certain of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at may  we are a party to no other material market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
