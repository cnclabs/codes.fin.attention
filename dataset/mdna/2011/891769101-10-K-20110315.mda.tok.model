item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  we have seen an improvement in our overall financial condition as of december  compared to december   which can be partially attributed to the implementation of these measures 
competition all phases of the business of the bank are highly competitive 
the bank competes with numerous financial institutions  including other commercial banks in the greater fort wayne  warsaw  allen county and kosciusko county market areas in northeast indiana 
in five new banks entered the market  while one left during  bringing the total banking institutions  excluding credit unions  to twenty two 
the new banks include regional banks huntington national bank and old national bank  along with community banks first federal of the midwest  state bank trust  and woodforest national 
additionally  during the latter portion of  national city bank  a large regional bank that currently ranks third in our marketplace in total deposit share  was purchased by pnc financial services group 
local ly  the formal name change to pnc bank took place during the second quarter of the bank  along with other commercial banks  competes with respect to its lending activities and competes in attracting demand deposits 
the bank also faces competition from thrift institutions  credit unions and other banks as well as finance companies  insurance companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage firms  money market funds  trust companies and other providers of financial services 
many of the bank s competitors have been in business for many years longer than the bank  have established customer bases  and are larger and have larger lending limits than the bank 
the bank competes for loans principally through its ability to communicate effectively with its customers and understand and meet their needs 
the bank offers personal attention  professional service  off site atm capability and competitive interest rates 
management believes that its personal service philosophy enhances the bank  s ability to compete favorably in attracting individuals and small to medium sized businesses 
since  the bank has ranked fourth in our allen county market place in total deposit share and currently comprises of the total marketshare 
the top three  jp morgan chase co  wells fargo company  and pnc financial services group  comprise of the total marketshare 
employees as of december   we had employees  including approximately full time equivalents 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
management believes that its relationship with our employees is good

the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below a lso include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
a prolonged economic downturn in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets may adversely affect our operations and our stock price 
a prolonged general economic downturn in the financial services industry resulted in uncertainty in financial markets throughout and in addition  as a consequence of the recession that the united states is now working its way out of  business activity across a wide range of industries face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and the extreme lack of liquidity in the global credit markets 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
the general economic downturn caused uncertainty in the financial markets over the past couple of years 
commercial  as well as consumer loan portfolio performances  deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages declined 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets  and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments  may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
we operate in a highly regulated banking environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or by the actions of our regulators 
tower bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the idfi  the federal reserve and the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors and borrowers of tower bank and for the protection of the fdic insurance fund 
the regulation and supervision by the federal reserve  the idfi and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the adverse classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowan ce for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  including enforcement actions  may have a material impact on our operations 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq that are applicable to us  have  in recent years  increased the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  including the costs of completing our audit and maintaining our internal controls 
additionally  congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which could materially affect the banking industry 
we have relatively high amounts of commercial  commercial real estate and development loans  and these loans have more credit risk than residential mortgage loans 
we generally invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans secured by business assets and commercial real estate than financial institutions that invest a greater proportion of their assets in loans secured by single family residences 
commercial real estate  commercial business and development loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending  due primarily to the relatively larger amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
while we did not engage in the business of sub prime lending  our construction  land development and land loan portfolio  along with our commercial loan portfolio and certain of our other loans  has been adversely affected by the recent downturn in the residential and commercial real estate market 
moreover  many of our borrowers also have more than one commercia l real estate  commercial business or development loan outstanding with us or with other institutions  and the turmoil in the credit markets has made it more difficult for them to continue and sustain their prior business levels  thereby reducing their available cash flows 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results 
we have an elevated amount of non performing assets  which has affected and could continue to adversely affect our net interest margin and our results 
a loan is considered non performing when full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is not probable 
although the level of non performing assets increased from million at december  to million at december   the primary reason for the increase is due to new proposed guidance on trouble debt restructured loans  which increased by million 
while we believe our loan portfolio is improving  there is still an elevated level of non performing assets on our books 
these and other non performing loans  even if they are eventually collected  in whole or in part  take longer periods of time to work out  which result in loss of income and or principal during the workout period  and also require additional resources 
we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  especially due to our level of non performing assets 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in provision for loan losses compared to million in net charge offs were million in compared to million in our non performing assets remain at elevated levels  which was indicative of the recessionary period in the economy and or our local real estate market  which we are working are way out of 
as such  some of our currently performing assets may not continue to perform according to their terms  and the value of the collateral may become insufficient to pay the remaining loan balances 
if this occurs  we may experience additional loan losses  which could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for lo ans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  status of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  anticipated duration of the current business downturn  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are  by nature  more subjective and fluid 
ou r estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
federal regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate that we have sufficient capital resources to satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities  it would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock 
new investors may also have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our current stockholders which may adversely impact our current stockholders 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we may not be able to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to maintain further or expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a further downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financ ial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  brokered deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or market conditions were to change 
in addition  if we fall below the fdic thresholds to be considered well capitalized  we will be unable to continue with uninterrupted access to the brokered funds markets 
although we consider these sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard  and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and we diversify our due from banks and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
the financials of the counterparties are routinely reviewed as part of our asset liability management process 
balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the us may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
changes in market interest rates have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense that we may pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our interest bearing assets generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning liabilities 
in  the federal funds rate decreased basis points to a low of at december  the rate remained unchanged from december  through december  in a rising interest rate environment  our net interest margin can be adversely impacted to the extent that our fixed rate loans do not reprice approximately of our loans as of december  
we also have interest rate floors on loans  ranging from to over the prime rate  which will hinder net interest margin growth in a rising interest rate environment until the prime rate breaks through the floor rates 
also in this situation  rates paid on non term deposit accounts will rise  thus also decreasing our margin 
additionally  deposit customers may move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts 
in a falling interest rate environment  however  our net interest margin could likewise be negatively affected  as competitive pressures might require us to decrease our lending interest rates  while these same competitive pressures could keep us from further reducing interest payment rates on our deposits 
such movements  therefore  could cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
we are also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest on our existing loans and securities 
moreover  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand  in which event our results of operations may be adversely affected by the amount of non interest expenses associated with mortgage banking activities  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  equipment and data processing costs and other operating costs 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and  in particular  our securities portfolio held for investment 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity 
our loan growth  although currently slowed  has historically outpaced our ability to generate lower cost in market deposits  and this has required us to find alternative funding sources  some of which may either not be available to us or available at greater cost  and which  to the extent thereof  adversely affects our net interest margin 
we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of our depositors and borrowers 
our loan growth  although currently by design at a maintenance level  has historically outpaced our ability to fund that loan growth with in market deposits 
accordingly  as part of our liquidity management  we have utilized a number of alternative funding sources 
in addition to deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we have utilized various alternative funding sources  such as out of market deposits purchased from brokers typically money market and certificates of deposit  borrowings from the federal home loan bank  and or from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
if we were to become less than well capitalized  as defined by applicable banking regulations  or if a written enfor cement order were to be imposed on us by our regulators  it could materially delay  make more costly or restrict our ability to borrow from the fhlb and the federal reserve bank or to acquire and retain brokered certificates of deposit 
our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
in  we purposely allowed our loan portfolio to decrease in order to focus on improving asset quality  increasing liquidity  and improving profitability 
this decrease in the loan portfolio allowed us to restructure the balance sheet to become more liquid by purchasing investments 
during  we strategically purchased brokered certificates of deposit and brokered money markets to lock in low rates for an extended period of time 
while this lowered our current net interest margin  it is helping to hedge increases in interest rates on the deposit side  as the terms for new brokered certificate of deposit purchases ranged from two years to ten years  with an average life of just more than six years 
the average rate on our brokered certificates of deposit purchases was 
t o offset the increase in interest expense from brokered certificates of deposit  we aggressively reduced our rates on all deposit products to levels still acceptable within the local market and purchased variable rate brokered money market accounts with an average rate of approximately 
as long term interest rates begin to increase  the opportunity to hedge interest rate risk is limited 
increased and or special fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  such as the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
beginning in  the economic environment led to increased levels of bank failures and expectations for further failures  which  in turn  increased the fdic s resolution costs and led to a reduction in the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which had decreased to of insured deposits as of june   to the statutory minimum of of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic significantly increased both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates charted to financial institutions for deposit insurance 
commencing with the first quarter of  our fdic deposit assessment rates increased to an annualized level of  in and  in  compared to  for  and this has and will continue to negatively impact our earnings 
moreover  the fdic required all institution s to prepay their assessments for the fourth quarter of and all of  and as a result  we were required to make a payment of million on december   which we recorded as a prepaid expense and started to amortize the expense over the three year assessment period 
as of december  the remaining prepaid expense was million 
payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance and may be restricted 
dividends on our capital stock  including our common stock and our series a convertible preferred stock  is strictly prohibited by the written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi 
for details regarding the written agreement  refer to the bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
once our written agreement restrictions are lifted  any future dividends will depend upon the board s assessment of our operating and financial condition  projected cash needs  contractual restrictions and any further restrictions imposed on us by our banking regulators 
from time to time  we may also become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that may have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the company from declaring or paying dividends 
we have issued trust preferred securities that prevent us from paying dividends on our capital stock in the event that we defer our interest payment obligations on the trust preferred debt 
in february  we notified the trustees of the trust preferred securities that we elected to defer interest payments on the securities indefinitely since the first quarter of therefore  we did not pay dividends in and will not be able to pay dividends on our capital stock until  at a minimum  we pay the interest due on the trust preferred securities 
technological advances may adversely impact tower financial corporation s business 
the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to does to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers 
a breach of information security or a breakdown in our data storage and distribution systems could adversely affect our earnings 
increasingly  we depend upon data processing  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks  and over the internet 
we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or that they may not from time to time malfunction  due either to human error or mechanical failure  despite safeguards we have instituted 
in addition  we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs 
if information security is breached  information can be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others 
these costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage  if any  which could adversely affect our earnings 
strong competition within the bank s market area has hurt and could continue to hurt our profits and slow our growth 
competition in our banking and financial services competitive market area  both in making loans and in attracting deposits  is intense  and our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in both arenas 
we compete in the greater fort wayne  warsaw  allen county and kosciusko county market areas of northeast indiana  with numerous commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
our ability to maintain and expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of our products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in the bank earning less on loans and paying more for deposits  which would reduce net interest income and adversely affect our results 
competition also may make it more difficult to attract deposits and  consequently  to grow loans 
the continuing concentration of loans in our primary market areas  and the decreased value of real estate and business assets in our market area  may result in further under collateralization of some of our loans  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our success depends primarily on the general economic condition within the metropolitan fort wayne  warsaw  allen county  and kosciusko county market areas in northeast indiana in which we conduct our business 
unlike large banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in our market area 
local economic conditions in our market areas  therefore  have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a continuation of the decline or a further deteriorization in general economic conditions in our market area caused by the loss of manufacturing and other jobs  decline in real estate market values  unemployment and other factors beyond our control  could further adversely affect the a bility of our customers to repay their loans and  therefore  our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate development and construction loans  decreases in housing demand brought about by a loss of jobs  an increase in homes in foreclosure or otherwise available for sale on the market and a reduction in demand for new housing may also have a negative affect on the ability of some of our borrowers to make timely repayment of their loans  which could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
moreover  further decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses  which would reduce our profits 
we face risks entering new markets or establishing new branches 
there are substantial costs associated with maintaining a banking facility  including the cost of construction  land purchases if owned or lease commitments if leased  equipping the facility  staffing commitments and marketing costs 
if we are not successful in establishing a customer base and conditions that enable us to profitably operate that facility  we may be forced to either sustain continuing losses or to close the facility 
in may  we opened a branch on the north side of fort wayne 
while there are several banks that have already established themselves in that market  we have improved our position by replacing a leased branch located in a strip mall with a free standing branch that is more visible to passing traffic at the same intersection 
in general  we believe our ability to compete in the market and realize an appropriate return to stockholders depends on the local economy and how the consumers react to our brand 
competition for loans and deposits may have adverse affects on our net interest income as well 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the idfi  the fdic  as insurer of our deposits  by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  as regulator of our bank and holding company and by the us congress and the indiana general assembly 
such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which a banking institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legi slation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
we are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti money laundering statutes and regulations 
in recent years  regulators have intensified their focus on the usa patriot act s anti money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance requirements 
there is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the office of foreign assets control 
in order to comply with regulations  guidelines and examination procedures in this area  we are required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems 
we cannot be certain that the policies  procedures and systems we have in place or may in the future put in place are or will be flawless 
therefore  there is no assurance that in every instance we are and will be in full compliance with these requirements 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary for most of our revenue because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank and its subsidiary  the trust company  we typically depend upon dividends from one or both of these entities for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends  internally or to stockholders  is currently prohibited by the written agreement 
for details regarding the written agreement  refer to the bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
once this is lifted  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
from time to time  we may also become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that may have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
our holding company expenses and interest obligations on our trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt securities issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends 
we depend heavily on our key banking and management personnel 
our success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executives and to attract and retain qualified and productive banking officers  who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating small to mid size banks 
these qualities are essential both for effective executive management and also for the growth and expansion of the bank s customer base for loans and deposits 
competition for such personnel is strong in the local banking industry  and we compete with many other banks and financial institutions  some of them with financial resources and benefits greater than ours  for such individuals 
in this market environment  we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require for future growth 
we expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages t hat include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a growing bank 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
recently enacted financial reform legislation will  among other things  create a new consumer financial protection bureau  tighten capital standards and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
this new law will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
effective one year after the date of enactment is a provision for the dodd frank act that eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
the dodd frank act also broadens the base for fdic deposit insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution  rather than deposits 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per account  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund  from to of insured deposits  and directs the fdic to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than billion in assets 
the dodd frank act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments  and authorizes the securities and exchange commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
it also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose clawback policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded o r not 
because we are a smaller reporting company  the requirement for a non binding vote on executive compensation does not apply to our company this year 
the dodd frank act requires minimum leverage tier and risk based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks  which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as tier capital  such as trust preferred securities 
because our bank has assets of more than million and less than billion  trust preferred securities issued before may  will still be considered tier capital 
it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the dodd frank act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks 
however  it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense

please also refer to the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of some of the principal risks and uncertainties inherent in our businesses 
overview net income of million was reported in compared to a net loss of million in the million increase in earnings from to was primarily due to a decrease in provision expense of million  an increase in net interest income of million  and an increase in the sale of securities coupled with a decrease in the amount of impairment on available for sale securities  which led to the increase in non interest income by million from noninterest expenses decreased by million  which was primarily due to savings reported in most expense categories totaling million  offset by an increase of  in fdic premiums 
offsetting these increases was a million change from a tax benefit in to tax expense in net interest income increased from to  due primarily to an increase in net interest margin from to 
in  we implemented interest rate floors on loans  which helped to maintain our net interest margin in and the increase in net interest margin in was due to aggressively reducing deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with local market rates 
these actions were in response to short term interest rates taking a basis point plunge from a fed funds rate of to a low of in december where they remained for the entire year of both and non interest income increased by million from to primarily due to a decrease of  in an other than temporary impairment otti charge on two securities and an increase of  in the gain on sale of securities 
we also experienced increases in trust and brokerage fee income and brokered loan fees of  and  respectively 
operating expenses decreased by million  or  from to the decrease was due to a reduction in total employment expense by million  a decrease in occupancy and equipment by  and a decrease in postage and data processing totaling  processing decreased in due to the migration of our core system  which offered more options and created efficiencies in the support functions of the company 
we also outsourced the mailing of monthly account statements to the new core processor  which saved on postage and labor 
offsetting these saving was an increase in fdic premiums of  the increase in premiums was twofold 
first  premiums increased by approximately  annually as a result of us being downgraded after entering into a written ag reement with the federal reserve and the idfi effective in june per the fdic 
once the written agreement is lifted and we prove we can sustain profitability  we expect to see an approximate savings of  based on our current deposit base 
the second reason for an increase in fdic premiums was an increase in the use of brokered deposits for funding and electing to participate in the transaction account guaranty tag program which charges the company an additional premium to have the entire balance of all noninterest bearing transaction accounts fully insured by the fdic 
loan and professional expenses showed a slight decrease of  in compared to  but these two years are above what we have reported in past years 
in  we incurred additional legal expenses as a result of our written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi 
in  we entered into a consulting engagement to have our lending staffing and processes anal yzed 
the engagement included analyzing current staffing levels and our internal approval processes for commercial and consumer loans 
loan and professional expenses in both and also increased from prior years due to additional costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
total assets decreased by million  or  from the prior year 
the purposeful decrease in net loans of million partially offset by an increase in total securities by million was the primary reason for the decrease in total assets 
asset quality and liquidity continues to be a major focus of the bank  as we worked to turn our non performing assets into income producing assets 
while non performing assets increased by million from to  nonaccrual loans have decreased by  and other real estate owned decreased by  the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming assets was due to an increase of million in troubled debt restructured loans and an increase of million on loans greater than days past due and still accruing 
currently  there are three loan relationships in the troubled debt restructuring category  two commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan 
due to recent proposed guidance on troubled debt restructured loans  we have started reporting two loan relationships  one commercial and one commercial real estate loan  as troubled debt restructured loans 
included in delinquencies greater than days is an accruing million loan that has matured 
the bank has elected not to renew the loan and is seeking collection via legal process 
for specific details regarding these relationships  refer to the results of operations provision for loan losses section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
 the allowance for loan losses increased to from at december  during  we strategically purchased brokered certificates of deposit and brokered money markets in excess of the balance in by million 
the growth in brokered deposits was purposeful as we took advantage of the favorable rate environment to lock in low rates for an extended period of time 
terms for new brokered certificates of deposit purchases ranged from two years to ten years  with an average life of just more than six years 
the average rate on our brokered certificates of deposit purchases was 
to offset the increase in interest expense from brokered certificates of deposit  we aggressively reduced our rates on all deposit products to levels still acceptable within the local market and purchased variable rate brokered money market accounts with an average rate of app roximately 
these strategic decisions allowed us to grow our net interest margin year to date at december  to from at december   but we lost  of core deposits from core deposits now comprise of total deposits  compared to in the prior year 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies ar e defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the l oan portfolio and general economic conditions 
absent the availability of some of these factors  we base our estimates upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects an increase of million from a net loss of million in and a million increase from net income of million posted in net income per diluted share of reflects an increase of from a net loss reported in and an increase of from net income of reported in net interest income increased from to  due primarily to an increase in net interest margin from to 
noninterest income increased by million due to an increase of  in gain on sale of securities and a decrease in the other than temporary impairment charge on two securities of  compared to we also experienced an increase in trust and brokerage fees of  and brokered loan fees  consisting primarily of loan brokerage fees  of  provision expense decreased in by million compared to  which was directly impacted by a reduction in charge offs from to of million 
noninterest expense decreased by million due to reductions in salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment  and office supplies and posta ge of million   and  respectively 
these decreases were offset by an increase of  in fdic premiums from to loan and professional costs decreased slightly by  but remain higher than normal due to consulting legal counsel regarding the written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi and collection expenses associated with cleaning up our nonperforming assets 
the costs and valuation expenses on other real estate owned showed little change as we had elevated levels of write downs in both and associated with reporting the properties at fair value 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  resulting in million in net interest income 
the increase of million in net interest income in from was due to an increase in net interest margin  which was offset by elevated levels of non per forming assets and a purposeful decrease in total loans 
through the implementation of interest rate floors on loans in and  we were able to maintain our net interest margin 
the increase in net interest margin in was due to aggressively reducing deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with local market rates 
these actions were in response to short term interest rates taking a basis point plunge from a fed funds rate of to a low of in december where they remained for the entire year of both and the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the increase in net yield during was due to continuing to implement the interest rate floor on loans and reducing the deposit rates 
these increases to the yield were offset by unchanged short term interest rates after a basis point drop from january  to december   specifically the fed funds rate  which remained at through and deposit costs also decreased as a result of a shift of certificates of deposit greater than  to lower cost core deposits  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings  and money market accounts which increased by million  million  and million  respectively  since december  health savings accounts were the primary increase in interest bearing checking as they increased by million throughout the year 
we also increased our out of market funds by adding a new product  brokered money market accounts 
during the second half of  we purchased approximately million of brokered money market deposits at a variable rate that ranged from to  which also helped keep our deposit costs down 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

the increase in net interest margin in was due to aggressively reducing deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with lo cal market rates

a portion of the provision expense was recorded to replenish the reserve as it is used to charge off or charge down loans 
another portion of the expense was used to increase reserves on three commercial real estate relationships and one commercial relationship that were deemed impaired in or and required additional reserves of approximately million in due to a decrease in collateral values 
the provision expense recorded in reflected a million d ecrease from the provision expense recorded in was primarily due to significant charge offs related to a group of pre residential real estate development loans made up of different parties within the same development 
the economic downturn also had an effect on a few commercial loan relationships requiring specific reserves and charge offs due to liquidation of those businesses in the provision expense reflects a million increase from the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was   and at december    and  respectively 
in  as the economy started to deteriorate and the residential development and home building sectors were severely weakened  we continued to increase our overall loan reserve in anticipation of stress on certain portions of our loan portfolio 
in  we continued this trend of increasing reserves  but we also used the allowance through charging off million in commercial lending relationships and million in commercial real estate lending relationships 
of these charge offs  several of these relationships were originated prior to tightening our lending policy  which would not have allowed the loans to be approved either because of the loan structure or the size of the investment in the loan 
in  the provision expense of million recorded was primarily related to the million i n net charge offs taken during the year  of which million was previously reserved for  and to increase specific reserves on three impaired commercial real estate relationships and one impaired commercial relationship requiring additional reserves of approximately million in these increases in the allowance were offset by decreases in specific reserves on four relationships totaling approximately  of the four relationships  one loan paid off and the other three have shown decreased risk through financial situation improvements and or improvements in collateral value 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   an increase of million from million in nonperforming loans at december  while nonperforming loans increased  the nonaccrual loans decreased by  the primary reasons for the increase in nonperforming loans are the increase in troubled debt restructurings of million and the increase in loans greater than days past due but still accruing of million 
currently  there are three loan relationships in the troubled debt restructuring category  two commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan 
due to recent proposed guidance on troubled debt restructured loans  we decided to start reporting two loan relationships  one commercial and one commercial real estate loan  as troubled debt restructured loans 
while these two loans may not have been considered troubled debt restructurings under current regulations  we believed it would be appropriate to take a conservative approach and follow the new proposed guidance 
since these two were restructured in  both have been making payments according to their modified contractual terms and have not been past due more than days since the modification 
 if this performance continues through the first quarter of  we will consider moving them to a performing status 
the third loan making up the remainder of the balance of million in the troubled debt restructured loan total was modified to allow for the sale of the mortgaged property to occur 
the sale is currently being negotiated between the borrower and the lessee of the facility and we expect resolution to occur sometime in included in delinquencies greater than days is an accruing million loan that has matured 
the bank has elected not to renew the loan and is seeking collection via legal process 
the loan remains in accruing status because it is further supported by the unlimited guaranty of a third party whose guaranty is fully secured by a mortgage on a performing commercial real estate property that is unrelated to the borrower s enterprise 
this loan is expected to remain technically nonperforming during the pendency of our legal collection efforts but ultimate collection is not currently in doubt 
we reported million of net charge offs  or of average loans  during compared to million in net charge offs  or of average loans  during and million in net charge offs during net loans decreased during by million  or approximately  due to the company s focus on improving asset quality  profitability  and liquidity  along with a recognition of declining economic trends 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   a decrease of million from the million of nonperforming loans at december  classified assets are comprised of accruing substandard and non accrual loans  along with impaired investments and other real estate owned 
classified assets reached their peak at the end of the second quarter of at million 
we have made steady progress over the past eighteen months to reduce these assets by million  or 
the classified assets ratio is a key indicator used by our regulators to determine the health of financial institutions 
it is calculated by dividing classified assets by the sum of tier capital and the allowance for loan losses alll 
at december   our classified assets were  which shows improvement from on december  we would like this ratio to be at or below by the end of  the following table presents the classified assets semi annually from june  to december  december june december june classified loans substandard accruing nonaccrual total classified loans impaired securities other real estate owned total classified assets tier capital and alll classifed asset ratio noninterest income total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase from was primarily due to an  increase in gain on sale of securities  a  decrease in other than temporary impairment on securities  and a  increase in trust and brokerage fees 
noninterest income was negatively impacted by an other than temporary impairment on two securities of  in  which is a decrease of  from the amount recorded in of  there were no charges for other than temporary impairment in trust and brokerage fees are directly impacted by the change in assets under management 
there was a million decline in assets under management during  primarily during the fourth quarter 
up until that point  assets under management grew  which explains the increase in trust and brokerage fees during the year 
loan broker fees were  an increase of  or  from fees of  and  recorded in and  respectively 
deposit service charges remained flat in compared to both and reported services charges of million  compared to million in noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million  or  during over the decrease in expenses is attributable to a decrease of million in salaries and benefits and a decrease of  in occupancy and equipment  offset by an increase in fdic insurance premiums of  salary and benefits costs led the way in in cost savings with a decrease of million  or  from december  these costs totaled million in and were of noninterest expenses 
the main reason for the decrease in was primarily due to receiving a full year s benefit from the early retirement of the chairman of our board of directors in december and the reduction in workforce by full time employees in due to renegotiating our lease at our headquarters and a reduction in depreciation expenses due to fixed assets being fully depreciated  we were able to show savings of  in these expenses totaled million in and were of noninterest expenses 
office supplies expense decreased by  primarily due to conservative purchasing and reductions in postage by outsourcing our statement processing to our core system processor 
offsetting the savings in noninterest expenses was a  increase in fdic insurance premiums primarily due to increased assessment rates based on our written agreement with the federal reserve 
premiums also increased due to increasing deposits  specifically brokered deposits  and by continuing to participate in the transaction account guaran tee tag program  which charges the company an additional premium to have the entire balance of all noninterest bearing transaction accounts fully insured by the fdic 
while most noninterest expenses decreased in  most of them decreased less than  including business development  data processing  and marketing 
salary and benefit costs were million in and were of total noninterest expenses 
loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by  or 
loan and professional expenses in increased from due to entering into a consulting engagement to have our lending staffing and processes analyzed 
the engagement included analyzing current staffing levels and our internal approval processes for commercial and consumer loans 
the engagement resulted in the creation of a centralized underwriting function for consumer loans and making necessary staffing adjustments in the areas of credit and lending 
these expenses also increased due to additional costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic increased in and an industry wide one time special assessment of  in the second quarter was made causing a total increase of  from to real estate market values remained low in causing write downs and professional expenses of million on properties that have moved to other real estate owned 
during  salaries and benefits costs were million  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million 
additional large overhead expenses in included costs for professional fees and services  which amounted to million and data processing expenses of million 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the efficiency ratio decreased in primarily due to the million increase in noninterest income and the million decrease in noninterest expenses 
while we did have a one time extraordinary gain on sale of securities of  in the third quarter of  our efficiency would have been without this unexpected income 
the efficiency ratio was slightly higher in and  but reflects a decrease in net interest income caused by steep interest rate cuts taken in that remained unchanged in and  along with elevated expenses due to valuation adjustment to foreclosed assets and increased fdic premiums 
during we made significant strides in improving our net interest margin  which translated into improved net interest income in improvement in the efficiency ratio will be obtained through an increase in revenue  both net interest income and fee income 
income taxes expense during  we recorded tax expense of  compared to million of tax benefit and  of tax expense in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for the low effective tax rate in and was primarily due to modest levels of income offset by tax exempt investment income derived from investing in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance  which typically totals approximately million each year 
the income tax benefit recorded in was the result of a net loss posted and was offset by writing off our state deferred tax asset due to determining that our state deferred tax asset created from the state net operating loss from our r eal estate investment trust reit was more likely than not unrealizable 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
affecting the increase in stockholders equity during was million in net income  million in net proceeds from a private placement of  shares of common stock  and  in unrealized gains  net of tax  on available for sale securities 
additionally  we recorded  of restricted stock compensation expense 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in we refined our capital contingency plan and we have established new internal minimum capital levels that are in excess of those required by the regulators to remain well capitalized 
the plan provides that our total risk based capital ratio should be equal to or greater than and our leverage ratio should be equal to or greater than 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends at annual rate of per share payable in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to pay a dividend of per share for the first quarter dividend payment 
in the second quarter of  however  we elec ted to forego the declaration of dividends on our common stock indefinitely 
the decision was based on the desire to retain capital and hedge against challenging economic and banking industry conditions as well as to maintain tower bank s current well capitalized status within the federal reserve system 
on may   we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi  effective april  the written agreement 
for more detail regarding the written agreement  refer to bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
one of the requirements in the written agreement was that we not pay dividends on or redeem any of our common or preferred stock or other capital stock  or make any payments of interest on its trust preferred debt  without written approval from the federal reserve 
in response to these requirements  no preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends or trust preferred debt interest payments were made in liquidity and capital ratios december  loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  cash flow from securities  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
we were able to utilize the million decline in net loans in to pay down fhlb advances and increase liquidity through the purchase of securities  which reported an increase of million 
overall deposits increased by million compared to a decline in deposits from to of million 
we mainly generate deposits from in market sources  however  we also include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities in our funding base 
at december   the balances in brokered deposits  which included both money market accounts and certificates of deposit  and fhlb borrowings were million and million respectively 
this was an increase of million in brokered deposits and a decrease of million in fhlb borrowing from at december   the balance in brokered cds and fhlb borrowings were million and million respectively 
we expect the loan portfolio to grow moderately through funding for the loan portfolio will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment interest rate sensitivity strategies and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased along with borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and million at december  the unused line at the discount window totaled million at december  and december  we view this type of funding as a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may re quire payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower

related persons transactions are subject to our statement of policy for the review  approval or ratification of transactions with related persons 
a copy of this policy is available on our website at www 
towerbank 
net 
the policy applies to any transaction with a related person 
under our policy  a related person is a person who is  or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year was a director or executive officer  a nominee to become a director  a stockholder who beneficially owns or more of our common stock  an immediate family member that is  a spouse  child  parent  sibling  or an in law of any of the foregoing persons  as well as any entity which is owned or controlled by any of such persons or of which such person is a general partner or a or greater beneficial owner or any other person identified by our audit committee or our board of directors as a related person for purposes of this policy 
once a person has been identified as related person and if to wer financial corporation or any subsidiary is a participant  then if the aggregate amount involved in the transaction exceeds  and the related person has a direct or indirect interest other than simply as a result of being a director or less than a beneficial owner of the entity involved the transaction must be considered  approved or ratified by the audit committee 
we have established the threshold transactional amount at  which triggers the review  even though applicable sec regulations set the threshold at  we have done this so that even smaller transactions with related persons will be reviewed for fairness and appropriateness 
employment of a related person in the ordinary course of business consistent with our policies and practices with respect to the employment of non related persons in similar positions so long as the related person is not an executive officer required to be reported in our annual proxy statement is not subject to the policy 
transactions involving competitive bids or transactions involving services as a bank depository  transfer agent  registrar  or trustee are considered pre approved for purposes of our policy 
all other transactions subject to our policy must be approved in advance by the audit committee  unless our chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that it is impractical to wait until an audit committee meeting 
in such event  the chair of the audit committee may review and approve the proposed related person transaction but shall then promptly report any such approval to the full audit committee 
all material facts respecting the related person transaction must be disclosed to the audit committee 
in the event that we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been approved prior to its consummation  the matter must then still be reviewed by the audit committee  which will then review all relevant facts and circumstances  shall evaluate all available options including ratification  revision or te rmination of the transaction  and shall take such course of action as it deems appropriate 
in reviewing any related person transaction  the audit committee must consider the proposed benefits to the company  the availability of other sources of comparable products or services  an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is at least on terms comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally  and must then determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the company 
financial condition during  we continued to focus on improving profitability  both short term and long term  by improving asset quality  restructuring the balance sheet  increasing the net interest margin  and controlling expenses 
while nonperforming asset levels remain high  we are seeing improvement in several lending relationships  where they have been rehabilitated and could move to a performing status sometime in the near future 
to be able to move to performing status once a loan is considered nonperforming  certain performance levels are expected and must be sustained for a period of time 
in  several loans were moved off the nonperforming list through improvements  charge downs or fair value adjustments  and refinancing through another institution 
total loans decreased by million and we re offset by an increase in long term investments  resulting in a decrease in total assets of million in from december  with this decrease in assets  we were able to reduce our fhlb borrowings by million 
an increase in total deposits of million offset the decrease in borrowings and primarily consisted of an increase in brokered deposits 
while asset size has decreased over the past couple of years  management anticipates that assets will begin to grow slowly in the near future as we look to increase our earning assets  through the origination and purchasing of quality loans and investments while maintaining our current asset allocation 
earning assets the bank s net loans declined million  or  during total loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates and were made to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate categories are represen ted by owner occupied and investment real estate at million  or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at million  or of total loans 
while the general portfolio mix has remained about the same  the main direction the bank has taken was to put more resources into the commercial versus the commercial real estate product 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team 
management believes that loan portfolio will remain stagnant during the following table presents loans outstanding as of december      and loans outstanding december  in thousands commercial commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer total loans net deferred loan fees costs allowance for loan losses net loans the following table presents the maturity of total loans outstanding as of december   according to scheduled repayments of principal and also based upon repricing opportunities 
maturities of loans outstanding in thousands within year years over years totals loans contractual maturity dates commercial commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer total loans loan repricing opportunities fixed rate variable rate total loans the bank s credit policies establish  monitor for effectiveness and adjust guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality 
these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectability 
identified probl em loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were million  a decrease of million or from  of potential problem loans outstanding on the watchlist 
at december   there were million of potential problem loans outstanding on the watchlist 
this decrease in loans on the watchlist is a reflection of management s focus on improving asset quality 
over the past few years  we have been prudent in recognizing and reporting loans in trouble and helping them return to a performing status 
this practice is reflected through an increase in our troubled debt restructurings 
we modified two loans in  one was modified to secure more collateral in the amo unt of  and the other was modified to extend the amortization period from to years 
both loans were modified within our normal lending guidelines  but are required to be labeled as troubled debt restructuring based on the new proposed guidance on troubled debt restructurings 
nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status  million of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans 
while nonperforming loans increased  the nonaccrual loans decreased by  the primary reasons for the increase in nonperforming loans are the increase in troubled debt restructurings of million and the increase in loans greater than days past due but still accruing of million 
currently  there are three loan relationships in the troubled debt restructuring category  two commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan 
due to recent proposed guidance on troubled debt restructured loans  we have started reporting two loan relation ships as troubled debt restructured loans  as mentioned in the previous paragraph 
included in delinquencies greater than days is an accruing million loan that has matured 
the bank has elected not to renew the loan and is seeking collection via legal process 
for specific details regarding these relationships  refer to the results of operations provision for loan losses section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
total impaired loans were million  which included most of the nonperforming loans plus loans deemed impaired and still accruing of million

there was one residential real estate loan from a pool of loans purchased in from countrywide  now serviced by bank of america  that had a  charge off  but only had a small reserve based on asc guidelines 
the remaining net charge offs were less than  each 
offsetting the charge offs were  of recoveries  which included a recovery of  on one commercial loan relationship that was charged off earlier in the year 
of the loans charged off in  million in charge offs were for three commercial real estate loan relationships and five commercial loan relationships 
there were other smaller charge offs but none in excess of  while all others were less than that 
the charge offs were offset by  of recoveries from two commercial loan relationships  one of which was related to the charge offs reported earlier in of the loans charged off in  million in charge offs were for two commercial real estate loans and one commercial loan 
there were other smaller charge offs but none in excess of  while all others were less than that

we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations

additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns

the company  through the bank s investment subsidiary  owns a million original investment in pretsl xxv  a pooled trust preferred investment with a book value of million at the time of purchase 
this is the company s only pooled trust preferred security and is classified as a collateralized debt obligation 
at december   the market value of the investment was  and the book value was  the investment was rated ca by moody s and c by fitch 
the investment is divided into seven tranches 
tower s investment is in the fifth tranche c  meaning the cashflows on the investment are subordinated to the higher placed tranches 
there are sixty eight issuing participants in pretsl xxv 
fifty eight of the issuers are banks or bank holding companies  with the remaining issuers being insurance companies 
as of december   the amount of deferrals and defaults was million  or of the total pool 
of the total million of original collateral  million is currently paying interest 
the defaults and deferrals occurred as follows deferral default march  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  million of defaults at december  were reported as deferrals in september  the company uses an other than temporary impairment otti evaluation model to compare the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimate to determine whether an adverse change in cash flows has occurred during the quarter 
the otti model considers the structure and term of the collateralized debt obligation cdo and the financial condition of the underlying issuers 
specifically  the model details interest rates  principal balances of note classes and underlying issuers  the timing and amount of interest and principal payments of the underlying issuers  and the allocation of the payments to the note classes 
the current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of u nderlying trust preferred securities 
assumptions used in the model include expected future default rates and prepayments 
we assume that all interest payment deferrals will become defaults prior to their next payment dates and that there will be no recoveries on defaults 
in addition we use the model to stress each cdo  or make assumptions more severe than expected activity  to determine the degree to which assumptions could deteriorate before the cdo could no longer fully support repayment of tower s note class 
we evaluate the credit quality of each underlying issuer in the pool and apply a risk rating for each issuer and then put this risk rating into a relevant risk model to identify immediate default risk 
upon completion of the december  analysis  our model indicated that the security was other than temporarily impaired 
based on this conclusion at december   the investment had otti of approximately  or  the company owns a private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo with an original investment of million 
at december   the market value of the investment was  and the book value was  the investment was rated caa by moody s and ccc by s p 
this bond is classified as a super senior tranche because its cash flow is not subordinated to any other tranche in the deal and is classified as a mortgage backed security residential 
we used the intex database to evaluate and model each individual loan in the underlying collateral of this security 
in  we noticed that the credit quality of the underlying collateral was marginally deteriorating causing us to more aggressively monitor and analyze for other than temporary impairment 
in  we continued to monitor and analyze this investment and took additional charges for other than temporary impairment when deemed necessary 
to monitor this investment  management has evaluated loan delinquencies  foreclosures  other real estate owned oreo and bankruptcies as shown in the table below prior to making assumptions on the performing loans 
december september june march delinquency delinquency other real estate owned foreclosure bankruptcy december september june march delinquency delinquency other real estate owned foreclosure bankruptcy we utilized intex data to determine the default assumptions for all loans that are classified as past due  oreo or in foreclosure 
a severity rate was assumed on all defaults 
this number was derived from the pool average over the last months 
the default rate differs for each state based on the severity of that state s home price depreciation and the number of days the loan is past due 
any foreclosure or loan classified as oreo is immediately liquidated at a severity 
the current loan category is stratified by fico scores and the level of asset documentation full documentation  low documentation  or no documentation 
the loan performance database driven by intex data is mined for historical probabilities of loans meeting these characteristics moving into default 
this was done for   and periods 
the average default rate is then calculated  as well as its standard deviation 
two standard deviations are then added to this mean to derive the current loan cdr assumptions  representing what management feels is a stressed scenario 
we used the yield at the time of purchase as the discount rate for the cash flow analysis 
at the time of purchase the bond was yielding 
therefore  all cash flows in the otti analysis were discounted by to get a present value 
to determine the fair value  we surveyed two bond desks to see what yield it would take to sell the bond in the open market 
both desks said it would take a yield of to get someone to buy this bond 
management decided to use the conservative figure and discounted the cash flows by 
the two bonds desks that were surveyed are sterne agee and performance trust 
upon completion of the december  analysis based on the assumptions above  our model indicated that the private label cmo was other than temporarily impaired 
based on this conclusion at december   the investment had otti of approximately  or  short term investments and fed funds sold federal funds sold  consisting of excess funds sold overnight to correspondent banks  and short term investments and interest bearing deposits  consisting of certificates of deposit with maturities less than days and interest bearing accounts at correspondent banks  are used to manage daily liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity 
together  these short term assets  which recorded an increase of million during  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  these short term assets were approximately and of earning assets  respectively 
source of funds our major source of funds is from core deposits of local businesses  governmental and municipal public fund entities  and consumers within our market area 
we also generate certificates of deposit through national out of market sources outside allen and surrounding counties 
we generate these out of market deposits through negotiated transactions with brokers 
total deposits were million at december  and million at december   an increase of million  or

interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  during and ended at million compared to million at december  interest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of approximately in money market accounts  in interest bearing checking and savings accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the december  percentages reflect a modest change in the deposit mix from  when the percentages were   and  respectively 
interest bearing checking  money markets  savings  and brokered deposits all increased from to the largest increase was in brokered deposits with increases totaling million  which were comprised of increases in brokered certificates of deposit of million and brokered money market accounts of million 
the growth in brokered cd s was purposeful as we took advantage of the favorable rate environment to lock in low rates for an extended period of time 
during the first half of  we purchased million of brokered certificates of deposit with terms ranging from two years to ten years  with an average life of just more than six years 
the average rate on our brokered cd purchases was 
the second largest increase was in the interest bearing checking category  as they increased by million  or 
the large increase came from our consumer and health savings accounts 
health savings accounts continue to be a high growth  low cost product for us which is reflected by increases in balances of million from to and million from to as of december   we had over  active health savings accounts 
money market accounts increased by million  or  as customers searched for a higher interest product without locking in to a long term product  such as a certificate of deposit 
cds under  and cds over  decreased by million and million  respectively  in several of the cd rates we offered are tied to a key rate  such as prime or the fed funds rate 
when the fed funds rate went down to in december  many customers decided to move their money from this product 
we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  we did have borrowings in the amount of million in fhlb bullet advances at december  compared to million in fhlb bullet advances and million in variable rate advances at december  the decrease in fhlb borrowings during was primarily due to an increase in total deposits 
we had million of aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and we currently have two statutory trust subsidiaries 
tct effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of million on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities became redeemable prior to the maturity date as of december  and each year thereafter at our option

the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having re ceived prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option 
at december   the interest rate on tct will move to a floating rate of three month libor plus basis points  unless we choose to redeem it at that point 
in january  at the request of our regulators  our board of directors adopted a resolution requiring that we seek written approval from the federal reserve prior to incurring any additional parent company debt  including the addition of trust preferred securities and advances on any existing lines of credit 
in january  our board of directors adopted a resolution that supersedes the one from january that states the company will refrain from making interest payments of interest on existing trust preferred securities without first obtaining written approval from the federal reserve bank 
per the debenture agreements  we have the ability to defer payment of the interest for twenty consecutive quarters 
during  we sent the written notice each quarter beginning with the first quarter of to the trustees of the trust preferred securities stating that we elected to defer payment of the interest 
while no payments of interest were made in  we continued to accrue the payments for each quarter 
this is the primary reason for the increase in the accrued interest payable of  from to in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of outstanding common stock 
by december   all  approved shares were repurchased at an average price of 
our board also adopted a resolution requiring that we seek approval from the federal reserve prior to repurchasing any further shares in an amount exceeding  other than those shares covered by the may repurchase plan 
this resolution was also at the request of our regulators 
on september   we sold  shares of series a convertible preferred stock in the net amount of million 
each share was sold for each and is convertible into tower financial corporation common stock at a price per share of  which is a premium on the common stock market price on the purchase date  september  the series a convertible preferred stock has no expiration date  however  tower financial corporation has the right to call the shares on or after september  until september  at of par  after september  until september  at of par  and at par after september  the series a convertible preferred stock qualifies as tier capital and pays quarterly dividends at a rate of prime plus  with a ceiling of  per annum upon t he approval of the board of directors 
during   preferred stock shares converted to  shares of common stock at a price of per common stock share 
no dividends were paid on preferred stock in and  in dividends were paid in on may   we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi  effective april  the written agreement 
the written agreement does not contain any requirements to increase capital over and above the bank s current well capitalized status and does not impose any other capital ratio requirements 
among other things  the written agreement requires that the company will not pay dividends or redeem any preferred or common stock or other capital stock  or make interest payments on its trust preferred debt  without written approval from the federal reserve 
in  we complied with the written agreement and made no dividends on common or preferred stock and we elected to defer our interest payments on our trust preferred debt 
stockholders equity was million at december  and million at december  the increase of million was mainly attributable to net income of million posted in and a private placement of common stock with net proceeds of million 
other items affecting stockholders equity was a  increase in net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale and derivative instruments  net of tax and stock compensation expense of  at december   we had a balance of million in retained earnings while at december  the balance was million  an increase of million from due to net income posted in see results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our sa fety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis in thousands within three months three to twelve months one to five years after five years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock loans held for sale fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over brokered deposit money market brokered deposit certificate of deposit short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results wil l differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date
