table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a is designed to provide information that is supplemental to  and should be read together with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
information in md a is intended to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding of i our consolidated financial statements  ii the changes in certain key items within those financial statements from year to year  iii the primary factors that contributed to those changes  iv any changes in known trends or uncertainties that we are aware of and that may have a material effect on our future performance  and v how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  md a provides information about our business segments and how the results of those segments impact our results of operations and financial condition as a whole 
executive summary for  we recognized net income attributable to navistar international corporation of billion  or of diluted earnings per share compared to million  or of diluted earnings per share for included in the results is the billion benefit from the release of a portion of the company income tax valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance release was based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will realize a substantial portion of our domestic deferred tax assets and is reflective of our continued positive outlook of the company operations 
adjusting to exclude the net impact of the release of the income tax valuation allowance and certain other items that are not considered to be part of the ongoing business  we recognized net income attributable to navistar international corporation of million  or of diluted earnings per share for  as reconciled in the table below 
during  we delivered strong performance as total industry volumes within the u 
s and canada school bus and class through medium and heavy truck our traditional markets continued to improve 
our truck segment benefited from increases in worldwide unit chargeouts  including both our traditional and expansionary businesses 
we delivered on our expected military sales  included within our truck and parts segment sales  of approximately billion in the results of our truck segment also reflect the impact of impairment and restructuring charges  as well as other actions  that we expect will optimize our operations and provide future benefits 
our engine segment displayed improved performance over the prior year  as well as continued sequential quarterly improvements 
the improvements were largely driven by increased intercompany sales and improved margins  primarily relating to our maxxforce and l big bore engines  and continued strong performance within south america 
our performance also reflects increased commercial sales within the us and canada for our parts segment and solid results from our financial services segment 
as the us and global markets recover from the recession  and with the average age of the us truck fleet at recent highs  we believe there will be a continuing increase in industry units from the historic lows experienced in we expect further improvements in our parts business  as customers continue to maintain older equipment and increase their overall fleet utilization  and we see benefits from the exclusive use of our maxxforce engines within our trucks 
we anticipate the traditional truck industry retail deliveries to be in the range of  units to  units for we continue to expand our global footprint with improved sales in our existing export markets  as well as product launches through our nc operations in australia and brazil  as well as our mnal and mnepl joint ventures with mahindra in india 
egr  combined with other strategies  is our solution to meet ongoing emissions requirements 
advancements in egr technology have resulted in reductions in emissions of nox from or more grams per brake horsepower hour through to grams in  to as low as grams in  with additional reductions in process 
our engines meet current epa and carb certification requirements because of emissions credits we earned from through via the early adoption of technologies that reduced nox levels beyond what was then mandated 
for some categories of engines we make  we expect to use our remaining emissions credits some time in we are engaged in ongoing discussions with officials from both epa and carb regarding potential regulatory solutions that would permit us to continue uninterrupted production of all of our engines 
we continue to invest in our egr technology to meet current epa emission requirements in north america and euro v emissions requirements in south america  and we believe that coupling egr with our other emission strategies will provide a significant competitive advantage over our competition products

we also incurred million of other related costs 
our truck segment recognized million of the engineering integration costs for the year ended october   for more information  see note  restructurings and impairments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b restructuring of north american manufacturing operations are charges primarily related to our plans to close our chatham  ontario heavy truck plant and workhorse chassis plant in union city  indiana  and to significantly scale back operations at our monaco recreational vehicle headquarters and motor coach manufacturing plant in coburg  oregon 
these costs include restructuring charges of million and other related costs of million 
in addition  the company recognized million of impairment charges related to certain intangible assets and property plant and equipment primarily related to these facilities 
our truck segment recognized million and million of restructuring of north american manufacturing operation charges for the three months and year ended october  for more information  see note  restructurings and impairments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
c in the fourth quarter of  the company had an unfavorable ruling related to a administrative change the company made to the prescription drug program under the opeb plan affecting plan participants who are medicare eligible 
as a result the company recognized approximately million of expense for postretirement benefits 
d in the third quarter of  we recognized an income tax benefit of billion from the release of a portion of our income tax valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an additional income tax benefit of million related to the release of a portion of our income tax valuation allowance 
as domestic earnings are now taxable with the release of the income tax valuation allowance we recognized million of domestic income tax expense for that would not have been recognized had we not released a portion of the income tax valuation allowance 
the million of domestic income taxes were netted against the total benefit of billion from the release of a portion of the income tax valuation allowance 
in addition  the other adjustments included in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect their income tax effect as the adjustments are intended to represent the impact on the company consolidated statement of operations without the incremental income tax effect that would result from the release of the income tax valuation allowance 
the charges related to our canadian operations would not be impacted as a full income tax valuation allowance remains for canada 
the financial measures of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to navistar international corporation are unaudited and are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  us gaap 
the non gaap financial information presented should be considered supplemental to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to navistar international corporation  excluding the impacts of the release of the income tax valuation allowance and certain other items that are not considered to be part of our ongoing business  improves the comparability of year to year results  and is representative of our underlying performance 
we have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors  analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analysis of operating results  to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non gaap adjustments shown in these reconciliations  and to provide an additional measure of performance 

table of contents business outlook and key trends for our truck segment  we expect benefits from further improvements in our traditional volumes as the industry continues to increase from the historic lows experienced in and according to act research  the average age of the truck fleet was years at the beginning of  which is the highest average age since we anticipate higher sales in for truck replacement as our customers refresh aging fleets 
we also expect demand for trucks to increase as freight volumes and rates continue to improve as the economy recovers 
in addition to increased demand  we expect to further benefit from improved revenues and margins associated with the exclusive use of our proprietary engines 
we expect to realize benefits from plant optimization actions taken during the trough of the truck cycle 
finally  we anticipate positive contributions from business acquisitions and investments made during this period 
within our engine segment  we expect our south american operations to continue to be a key contributor to overall sales and profitability 
as markets continue to improve in north america  we anticipate further increases in our intercompany sales to our truck segment  driven by sales of our maxxforce and l engines  as well as additional oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products 
beginning in  maxxforce engines were used in the entire north america vehicle offering of our truck segment as compared to outside sourcing for various model engines in prior years 
we have made investments in engineering and product development for our proprietary engines and expect to continue to make significant investments in attaining the nox emissions levels  as well as for other product innovations  cost reductions  and fuel usage efficiencies 
as freight volumes and rates increase in conjunction with the economic recovery  we expect our parts segment volumes will continue to improve within our commercial markets in the us and canada 
in addition  we anticipate incremental parts sales due to the relatively high overall age of the current us truck fleet and through the exclusive use of our maxxforce engines in our trucks  as well as the fulfillment of additional military orders 
certain trends have affected our results of operations for as compared to and in addition  we expect that certain key trends will impact our future results of operations 
some of these factors are as follows traditional truck market the traditional truck markets in which we compete are typically cyclical in nature and are strongly influenced by macro economic factors such as industrial production  demand for durable goods  capital spending  oil prices and consumer confidence 
worldwide engine unit sales our worldwide engine unit sales are impacted primarily by north america truck demand and sales in south america  our largest engine market outside of the north american market 
these markets are impacted by consumer demand for products that use our engines as well as macro economic factors such as oil prices and construction activity 
our worldwide engine unit sales were  units in   units in  and  units in in  we settled our legal dispute with ford and continued our north american supply agreement for diesel engines with ford through december  as a result  our north american unit sales to ford were  units as compared to  units for our worldwide engine unit sales were primarily to our truck segment in north america and to external customers in south america 
we also made certain oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products in north america  which have not historically been significant to our engine segment  but are expected to grow in additionally within our south america operations  we expect to transition of a portion of our volumes to lower margin contract manufacturing for certain customers 
we expect to offset this future impact with increased global engine and parts sales by our south american operations 
military sales in  we continued to leverage existing products and plants to meet the urgent demand of the us military and our north atlantic treaty organization nato allies 
our us military sales were billion  billion and billion in   and  respectively  and consisted of mrap vehicles  lower cost militarized commercial trucks  and sales of parts and services 
in  we received additional orders for mrap variants  including recovery vehicles  dash vehicles  and ambulances  which were substantially delivered in the remaining mrap units were delivered during the first quarter of  and we have not received further orders 
we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately billion to billion in annual sales 
global economy the global economy  and in particular the economies in the us and brazil markets  are continuing to recover  and the related financial markets have stabilized 
the impact of the economic recession and financial turmoil on the global markets poses continued risk as customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values 
lower demand for our customers products or services could also have a material negative effect on the demand for our products 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain key third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for particular components 
lower expectations of growth and profitability have resulted in impairments of long lived assets in the past and we could continue to experience pressure on the carrying values of our assets if conditions persist for an extended period of time 
emissions standards we have chosen egr  combined with other technologies  as our solution to meet the 
table of contents emissions standards 
we believe coupling egr with other emissions strategies gives our products advantages over our competitors liquid based urea scr solution and enables us to maintain flexibility in meeting emission requirements 
our emissions strategy places the burden and responsibility of meeting the emissions standards on the company versus our competitors liquid based urea scr solution that places that burden on the customer 
we believe that our customer friendly solution provides our products with a significant competitive advantage in north america  because most truck and engine manufacturers have chosen liquid based urea scr as the solution to meet emission standards 
we continue to invest in our egr technology  combined with other strategies  to meet current epa emission requirements in north america and euro v emissions requirements in south america  as well as evaluate our emissions strategies on a platform by platform basis to achieve the best long term solution for our customers in each of our vehicle applications 
our continued investment in research and development includes the further enhancement of our advanced egr technology to reach nox emissions as well as the ongoing development of reliable  high quality  high performance  and fuel efficient products 
in and  our engines met epa and carb certification requirements because of emissions credits we earned from through via the early adoption of technologies that reduced nox levels beyond what was then mandated 
the rate of usage of these emissions credits is dependent upon a variety of factors  including sales  product mix and improvements in technologies 
for some categories of engines we make  we expect to use our remaining emissions credits some time in we plan to submit certification applications to both epa and carb in the near future 
we believe that our engines meet both agencies certification requirements 
we are engaged in ongoing discussions with officials from both epa and carb regarding potential regulatory solutions that would permit us to continue uninterrupted production of all of our engines 
we cannot predict the outcome of these discussions nor the effect they may have on our business or our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
liter liter engine strategy in conjunction with our egr strategy  we only offer vehicles equipped with maxxforce engines in the us and canada 
for our class heavy and severe service lines  we offer our maxxforce and l engines  and launched our maxxforce l engine during the company has taken significant strides to demonstrate to our customers that  in many applications that historically used a l engine  our maxxforce l provides sufficient horsepower and torque 
impact of government regulation truck and engine manufacturers continue to face significant governmental regulation of their products  especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters 
truck manufacturers are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal  state  and local regulations 
government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the us federal and state levels 
because our products use fossil fuels  they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation  such as a cap and trade program  affecting the cost of fuels 
in  the epa and nhtsa issued final rules setting greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty engines and vehicles  which begin to apply in and are fully implemented in model year the company plans to comply with these rules through the use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available 
warranty costs in  we introduced changes to our engine line up in response to emissions requirements engines 
emissions regulations in the us and canada have resulted in rapid product development cycles  driving significant changes from previous engine models 
historically  warranty experience for launch year engines has been higher compared to the prior model year engines  however  over time we are able to refine both the design and manufacturing process to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
we have made substantial investments in engineering  product development  and testing within our engines to mitigate some of the warranty exposure 
our proactive actions related to the launch of the engines resulted in lower initial warranty costs and more rapid improvements than previous launches 
also contributing to higher warranty costs in is the use of all maxxforce engines in our north america product offering compared to previous outside sourcing for various engine models for which warranty costs were included in the engine purchase price 
raw material commodity costs commodity costs  which include steel  precious metals  resins  and petroleum products  increased by million in  decreased by million in  and increased by million in  as compared to the corresponding prior years 
we continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects market based commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes  material substitution  alternate supplier resourcing  global sourcing efforts  pricing performance  and hedging activities 
the objective of this strategy is to ensure cost stability and competitiveness in an often volatile global marketplace 
generally  the impact of commodity costs fluctuation in the global market will be reflected in our financial results on a time lag  and to a greater or lesser degree than incurred by our supply base depending on many factors including the terms of supplier contracts  special pricing arrangements  and any commodity hedging strategies employed 
facilities optimization we continue to seek further opportunities for manufacturing and operating efficiencies within our facilities 
in early  we announced and implemented our plan to consolidate bus production within our tulsa ic 
table of contents bus facility 
we are consolidating our executive management  certain business operations  and product development into a million square foot  world headquarters site in lisle  illinois  which we will complete in the first quarter of fiscal  and we are consolidating our testing and validation center in our melrose park facility  which we expect to complete in in july  we announced our intention to close our chatham  ontario truck manufacturing plant and union city  indiana chassis plant  and to significantly scale back operations at our monaco headquarters and motor coach manufacturing plant in coburg  oregon 
we continue to develop plans for efficient transitions related to these activities and evaluate other options to continue the optimization of our operations 
joint ventures and other investments we continue to make substantial investments in joint ventures and other businesses that are considered key growth opportunities to our core operations  as well as important expansionary markets 
in india  our joint ventures with mahindra sell commercial trucks and buses  as well as diesel engines for medium and heavy commercial trucks and buses 
we sell international and cat branded trucks in north america  as well as in various global markets through our alliance with caterpillar and our nc operations  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of navistar  inc in september in addition  we expect to finalize our china engine joint venture with jac in the company has also made recent acquisitions that present opportunities to further vertically integrate our operations and our product offerings  including continental mixer in and both ppt and monaco in ge capital alliance in march  we entered into a three year operating agreement with ge the ge operating agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  ge became our preferred source of retail customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the us we provide ge a loss sharing arrangement for certain credit losses  and under limited circumstances nfc retains the rights to originate retail customer financing 
loan originations under the ge operating agreement began in the third quarter of  which will continue to reduce nfc originations and portfolio balances in the future 
we expect retail finance receivables and retail finance revenues to continue to decline as our retail portfolio pays down

sales and revenues  net by geographic region are as follows total us and canada rest of world row change change change change change change in millions  except change truck engine parts financial services corporate and eliminations total truck segment sales increased billion  primarily due to higher traditional and worldwide volumes  improved pricing across all traditional classes  and increased row sales  predominantly due to strong sales volumes in south america 
partially offsetting these increases were lower military revenues  decreased volumes of our school buses  and decreased used truck sales 
engine segment sales increased million  primarily due to increased intercompany sales driven by the strengthening of the north america truck market and a shift in product mix to higher revenue units  particularly our maxxforce and l big bore engines 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of the ford business in north america in parts segment sales increased million  primarily due to increases in our us and canada commercial markets  reflecting higher volumes and improved pricing to recover higher material and freight related expenses  as well as improvements within our global parts business 
financial services segment revenues decreased compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in the average retail finance receivable balance  partially offset by improved wholesale note revenues on increased wholesale balances 
the decline in the average retail finance receivable balance was driven by decreased retail loan originations  which are now funded under the ge operating agreement 
costs of products sold cost of products sold increased by billion compared to the prior year  which was consistent with our growth in sales and revenues 
this increase was across our truck  engine  and parts segments 
the increase in costs of products sold was primarily due to higher costs of traditional units equipped with our proprietary engines  a shift in product mix to higher cost big bore engines  and increased commodity costs  particularly steel and rubber 
partially offsetting these contributors to the increase in cost of products sold were manufacturing cost efficiencies largely due to our flexible manufacturing strategy and other actions 
our warranty costs were higher  primarily due to increased volumes  as well as the exclusive use of our maxxforce engines in our traditional product offerings  as compared to previous outside sourcing for various engine models in which warranty costs were included in the engine purchase price 
in addition  we recognized increased adjustments to pre existing warranties of million primarily related to changes in our estimated warranty costs per unit on emission standard engines and various authorized field campaigns 
restructuring charges restructuring charges in were million  compared to a net reversal of million in the prior year 
the restructuring charges in were primarily related to the actions taken in at our fort wayne facility  springfield assembly plant  chatham heavy truck plant  wcc plant in union city  indiana  and monaco recreational vehicle headquarters and motor coach manufacturing plant in coburg  oregon within our truck segment 
the restructuring benefit in was primarily comprised of a million favorable settlement of a portion of contractual obligations related to the iep and indianapolis casting corporation icc restructuring and million of reversals of our remaining restructuring reserves for icc as a result of our decision to continue operations at icc 
these amounts were recognized at our engine segment 
for more information  see note  restructurings and impairments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets in  we recognized impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets of million  primarily in our truck segment  relating to charges at our chatham  ontario plant and wcc subsidiary 
the impairment charges reflect the impact of the closure of the chatham facility  and market deterioration and reduction in demand below previously anticipated levels for our wcc subsidiary 
for additional information  see note  restructurings and impairments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change in millions  except change selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding items presented separately below postretirement benefits expense allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses dealcor expenses incentive compensation and profit sharing provision for doubtful accounts nm total selling  general and administrative expenses nm not meaningful 
selling  general and administrative expenses were largely flat as compared to the prior year  reflecting increases in our truck  engine  and parts segments  partially offset by a decrease in the financial services segment 
compared to the prior year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental selling and sales support expenses due to the higher commissions related expenses  providing service support for our proprietary engines  engineering integration costs  and other expenses related to the move of our world headquarters 
partially offsetting these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were decreased postretirement benefits expense allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses  a net reversal of the provision for doubtful accounts  and decreased company owned dealcor expenses due to the sale of certain company owned dealerships 
postretirement benefits expense decreased largely due to a lower interest cost component  reflecting lower discount rates  and higher expected return on assets  primarily driven by higher values of plan assets based upon the october measurement 
for more information  see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the net reversal of the provision for doubtful accounts was attributable to declines in retail portfolio balances and actual charge offs 
in addition  the stabilization of the used truck market has resulted in increased demand and improved pricing for used equipment 
engineering and product development costs engineering and product development costs  which are incurred by our truck and engine segments  increased by million as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to our ongoing improvements to our egr and other technologies to meet emissions regulations at nox emissions levels in north america and euro v emissions regulations in south america  and new product programs within our truck and engine segments for the north american and global markets 
also contributing to the increase in engineering and product development costs were engineering integration costs related to the consolidation of our truck and engine segment engineering operations 
engineering and product development costs are incurred by our truck and engine segments for product innovations  cost reductions  and to enhance product and fuel usage efficiencies 
the company participates in very competitive markets with constant changes in regulatory requirements and technology and  accordingly  the company continues to believe that a strong commitment to engineering and product development is required to drive long term growth 
interest expense interest expense for was largely flat as compared to the prior year 
changes in interest expense attributable to the lower average debt balances were largely offset by slightly higher interest rates 
for more information  see note  debt  and note  financial instruments and commodity contracts  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other income  net other income  net was million for  compared to million in in  other income  net included a million benefit relating to the extinguishment of a financing liability for equipment within our engine segment 
in  other income  net was primarily comprised of reductions to reserves within our truck and engine segments for certain value added taxes in brazil that were reassessed and determined to be recoverable 
equity in loss of non consolidated affiliates equity in loss of non consolidated affiliates is derived from our ownership interest in partially owned affiliates  which are not consolidated 
losses of million and million reported in and  respectively  are primarily reflective of continued investment and start up losses associated with certain joint ventures  primarily our joint ventures with mahindra and nc prior to our acquisition of caterpillar ownership interest of nc in september for more information  see note  investments in and advances to non consolidated affiliates  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit expense in  we realized an income tax benefit of billion  primarily attributable to the release of a portion of our deferred tax valuation allowances during the year 
excluding the release of deferred tax valuation allowances  our tax expense in was million  which includes a million tax benefit related to the resolution of audits in various jurisdictions 
in  our tax expense was million  which includes a us alternative minimum tax benefit of million from the carryback of alternative minimum taxable losses to prior years 
our income tax expense on us and canadian operations was limited to current state income taxes  alternative minimum taxes net of refundable credits and other discrete items 
we have million of us net operating losses and million of general business credits as of october  we expect our cash payments of us taxes will be minimal  for so long as we are able to offset our us taxable income by these us net operating losses and tax credits  however our foreign taxes will continue to grow as we increase our global presence 
we continue to maintain valuation allowances for certain foreign operations  principally canada  and for certain state deferred tax assets which we believe on a more likely than not basis will not be realized 
for additional information  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net income attributable to non controlling interests net income attributable to non controlling interests is the result of our consolidation of subsidiaries in which we do not own 
our net income attributable to non controlling interests was million and million in and  respectively  and substantially relates to ford non controlling interest in our bdp subsidiary

truck segment net orders we define orders as written commitments received from customers and dealers during the year to purchase trucks 
net orders represent new orders received during the year less cancellations of orders made during the same year 
orders do not represent guarantees of purchases by customers or dealers and are subject to cancellation 
orders may be either sold orders  which will be built for specific customers  or stock orders  which will generally be built for dealer inventory for eventual sale to customers 
these orders may be placed at our assembly plants in the us and mexico for destinations anywhere in the world and include trucks  buses  and military vehicles 
historically  we have had an increase in net orders for stock inventory from our dealers at the end of the year due to a combination of demand  and from time to time we offer incentives to the dealers

if these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the us  they could be repatriated and their repatriation into the us would cause us to incur additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
any additional taxes could be offset  in part or in whole  by foreign tax credits 
the amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any of these amounts were repatriated

manufacturing cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for  compared with million in and million in the net decrease in cash used in investing activities for compared to was primarily attributable to a net decrease in investments in highly liquid marketable securities and a net decrease in investments in non consolidated affiliates  which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to ongoing manufacturing operations and engineering integration 
the net increase in cash used in investing activities for compared to was primarily due to increased investments in highly liquid marketable securities  investment in non consolidated affiliates  primarily related to nc  and increased capital expenditures  which were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions 
there were no significant business acquisitions during compared to when the company acquired assets of monaco coach corporation 
manufacturing cash flow from financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash used of million in and cash provided of million in the net decrease in cash used in financing activities for compared to was attributable to increased third party retail financing at our company owned dealcor dealers

table of contents borrowings and dividend payments from bdp to ford 
prior to our increased interest in bdp on june   we did not consolidate bdp and accordingly dividend payments from bdp to ford were not reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
lower borrowing in was due to the refinancing which resulted in the issuance of our senior notes and convertible notes

financial services operations financial services and adjustments cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities for compared to was due primarily to the smaller margin by which liquidations of finance receivables exceeded originations  resulting from an increase in originations of dealer financings and retail accounts 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in intercompany payables to our manufacturing operations 
the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared with was due primarily to an increase in cash used to support net working capital partially offset by an increase in net income 
the increase in cash used to support net working capital in was primarily attributable to the close out of interest rate swap derivatives in conjunction with the refinancing of variable rate debt  and payments on intercompany payables to our manufacturing operations  partially offset by a higher liquidation rate of our finance receivables portfolio and a reduction in inventories 
the decline in the finance receivables portfolio in resulted from fewer loan originations due to declining industry demand and the impact of the ge operating agreement  combined with customer payments on existing balances 
the decrease in inventory was attributable to vehicle sales exceeding lease terminations and decreased repossessions as portfolio performance continues to stabilize 
the increase in net income was attributable to a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower debt balances partially offset by lower revenues

financial services and adjustments cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million in  compared with cash provided of million in and million in changes in cash collateral required under our secured borrowings were the primary uses and sources of cash from investing activities in and the investment in cash collateral in the period was the result of the over collateralization of the retail securitization transaction completed in april and the accumulation of cash in anticipation of the maturity of million of investor notes in january the net increase in cash provided by investing activities in compared to was primarily a result of additional receivables pledged  in lieu of cash collateral  under the truck retail installment paper corporation trip revolving credit facility 
trip is a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary of nfc 
the trip credit facility  which matured and was repaid in june  was required to maintain a combined balance of million of receivables or cash collateral at all times 
this cash collateral was classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents 
financial services and adjustments cash flow from financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used of billion in and million in cash used in financing activities represents periodic payments on our funding facilities in excess of new funding requirements 
funding requirements declined sharply during the period as retail loan originations began funding through the ge operating agreement 
funding requirements declined less in the period as an increase in originations of dealer financings and retail accounts substantially offset the decline in funding requirements relating to retail loan originations 
the net increase in cash used in financing activities in compared to was due primarily to a net payment of balances outstanding under our credit facilities  principally nfc refinancing of its billion term loan and revolving credit facility with an million facility in december  and nfc repayment of the million trip credit facility in june debt see note  debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long term debt obligations 

table of contents funding of financial services the financial services segment has traditionally obtained the funds to provide financing to our dealers and retail customers from sales of finance receivables  short and long term bank borrowings  medium and long term debt  and commercial paper in mexico 
as of october   our funding consisted of asset backed securitization debt of billion  bank borrowings and revolving credit facilities of billion  commercial paper of million  and borrowings of million secured by operating and finance leases 
we use a number of special purpose entities spe to securitize and sell receivables 
navistar financial security corporation nfsc finances wholesale notes  navistar financial retail receivables corporation nfrrc and navistar financial asset corporation nfasc finances retail notes and finance leases  international truck leasing corporation itlc finances operating leases and some finance leases  and truck retail accounts corporation trac finances retail accounts 
we used trip  a million revolving retail warehouse facility  to temporarily fund retail notes and retail finance leases until the outstanding debt facility matured and was paid in june during  nfrrc issued secured notes totaling million 
in nfrrc issued secured notes totaling billion in which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay off certain existing retail secured borrowings and close out the related interest rate swap positions 
the remaining portion was used to pay off the revolving retail warehouse facility within trip of million at maturity on june  our securitization arrangements for retail notes and finance leases do not qualify for sales accounting treatment 
as a result  the transferred receivables and associated secured borrowings are included on the consolidated balance sheet and no gain or loss is recognized on these transfers 
nfsc has in place a master trust agreement with navistar financial dealer note master trust master trust  which was a qualifying special purpose entity qspe 
effective july   we amended the master trust agreement with the master trust 
the amendment disqualified the master trust as a qspe and therefore required the master trust to be evaluated for consolidation as a vie 
as we are the primary beneficiary of the master trust  the master trust assets and liabilities were consolidated into the assets and liabilities of the company 
previously  these securitization transactions were accounted for as sales and accordingly were not carried on our consolidated balance sheets 
our mexican financial services operations include navistar financial  sa de sa  sociedad financiera de objeto multiple  entidad no regulada nfm  and navistar comercial sa de sa  which provide vehicle financing and insurance to our dealers and retail customers in mexico

trac  our consolidated spe  utilizes a million funding facility arrangement that provides for the funding of eligible retail accounts receivables 
subsequent to the adoption of new accounting guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets  transfers of finance receivables from our financial services segment to the trac funding facility completed prior to november  retained their sale accounting treatment while transfers of finance receivables subsequent to november  no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
there were no remaining outstanding retained interests as of october  in november  we completed the sale of million of three year investor notes within the wholesale note trust funding 
table of contents facility 
this sale was eligible for funding under the us federal reserve talf program 
in april  our variable funding certificate vfc facility was paid off and replaced with the variable funding note vfn 
in july  the vfn was renewed until july in february  nfc completed the sale of million of two year investor notes within the wholesale note trust funding facility 
this sale was also eligible for funding under the talf program 
in addition  in february  nfc paid off investor notes of million upon maturity 
in december  the bank credit facility was refinanced with a five year million facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit including a sub revolver of up to million for nic mexican finance subsidiaries 
the new facility is subject to customary operational and financial covenants 
quarterly principal payments on the term portion will be million for the first eight quarters  million for the next quarters  with a final payment at maturity of million 
the bank credit facility in place at october   was scheduled to mature in december we are obligated under certain agreements with public and private lenders of nfc to maintain the subsidiary income before interest expense and income taxes at not less than of its total interest expense 
under these agreements  if nfc consolidated income before interest expense and income taxes is less than of its interest expense  nic or navistar  inc must make income maintenance payments to nfc to achieve the required ratio 
no such payments were required for the year ended october  derivative instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of our overall interest rate  foreign currency  and commodity risk management strategies to reduce our interest rate exposure  to potentially increase the return on invested funds  to reduce exchange rate risk for transactional exposures denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  and to minimize commodity price volatility 
the fair values of these derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information on derivatives and related market risks  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note  financial instruments and commodity contracts  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in october  in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  the company purchased call options for million 
the call options covered  shares of common stock  subject to adjustments  at an exercise price of 
the call options were intended to minimize share dilution associated with the convertible notes 
in addition  the company also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby  the company sold warrants for million to purchase in the aggregate  shares of common stock  subject to adjustments  at an exercise price of per share of common stock 
as the call options and warrants are indexed to our common stock  we recognized them in permanent equity in additional paid in capital 
capital resources we expend capital to support our operating and strategic plans 
such expenditures include investments to meet regulatory and emissions requirements  maintain capital assets  develop new products or improve existing products  and to enhance capacity or productivity 
many of the associated projects have long lead times and require commitments in advance of actual spending 
business units provide their estimates of costs of capital projects  expected returns  and benefits to senior management 
those projects are evaluated from the perspective of expected return and strategic importance  with a goal to maintain annual capital expenditures in the million to million range  exclusive of capital expenditures for equipment leased to others 
additionally  over the next two years we anticipate a temporary increase in capital expenditures above and beyond the aforementioned range 
this temporary increase is related to the purchase of a new office campus in lisle  illinois  and a technical research center  along with the refurbishment and enhancement of our facility in melrose park  illinois 
the majority of the capital expenditures for these projects will be financed through tax exempt bonds 
see note  debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits generally  our pension plans are funded by contributions made by us 
our policy is to fund the pension plans in accordance with applicable us and canadian government regulations and to make additional contributions from time to time 
at october   we have met all legal funding requirements 
we contributed million and million to our pension plans in and  respectively 
in  the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of was signed into law  which provides  among other things  the ability to reduce and defer required pension contributions that otherwise would have 
table of contents been required under the pension protection act of in  we expect to contribute million to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least million per year to the plans  depending on asset performance and discount rates 
other postretirement benefit obligations  such as retiree medical  are primarily funded in accordance with a settlement agreement between us  our employees  retirees  and collective bargaining organizations  which eliminated certain benefits provided prior to that date and provided for cost sharing between us and participants in the form of premiums  co payments  and deductibles 
our contributions totaled million in each of and we expect to contribute million to our other post employment benefit plans during as part of the settlement agreement  a base program trust was established in june to provide a vehicle for funding the health care liability through our contributions and retiree premiums 
a separate independent retiree supplemental benefit program was also established  which included our contribution of class b common stock  originally valued at million  to potentially reduce retiree premiums  co payments  and deductibles and provide additional benefits in subsequent periods 
in addition to the base program trust  we are contingently obligated to make profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust to potentially improve upon the basic benefits provided through the base program trust 
these profit sharing contributions are determined by means of a calculation as established through the settlement agreement 
there were no profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust during the three years ended october  the funded status of our plans is derived by subtracting the actuarially determined present value of the projected benefit obligations at year end from the end of year fair value of plan assets 
the under funded status of our pension plans increased by million during primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected benefit obligations 
our actual return on assets during was approximately for the us pension plans 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure the postretirement benefit obligation pbo was at october  compared to at october  the under funded status of our health and life insurance benefits increased by million primarily due to a court ruling ordering the reinstatement of the prescription drug benefits which existed prior to july  for participants who are medicare eligible  as well as a change in the estimate of the future rate of increase of reimbursements from medicare for retiree medical benefits 
we continue to seek opportunities to control our pension and other postretirement benefits expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into various arrangements not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
the principal off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into are guarantees and sales of receivables 
the following discussions address each of these items guarantees we occasionally provide guarantees that could obligate us to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
these include residual value guarantees  stand by letters of credit and surety bonds  credit and purchase commitments and indemnifications 
we have recognized liabilities for some of these guarantees in our consolidated balance sheets as they meet recognition and measurement provisions 
in addition to the liabilities that have been recognized  we are contingently liable for other potential losses under various guarantees that are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not believe claims that may be made under such guarantees would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
for more information  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sales of receivables our financial services operations typically sell  for legal purposes  our finance receivables to third parties while continuing to service the receivables thereafter 
in these securitization transactions  we transfer receivables to a bankruptcy remote spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated entity that is typically a trust or a conduit  which then issues asset backed securities to investors 
most of our securitization arrangements currently do not qualify for sales accounting treatment 
as a result  the transferred receivables and the associated secured borrowings are included in our consolidated balance sheets and no gain or loss is recorded for these transactions 
prior the amendment of the master trust and the adoption of new accounting guidance on accounting for transfers of financial 
table of contents assets  for accounting purposes  our transfers of wholesale notes and retail accounts receivables are treated as sales  our transfers of other receivables are treated as secured borrowings 
we recorded sales by removing receivables from the consolidated balance sheet and recording gains and losses in finance revenues 
effective july   our financial services segment amended the wholesale trust agreement with the master trust 
the amendment disqualified the master trust as a qspe and therefore required the master trust to be evaluated for consolidation as a vie 
as we are the primary beneficiary of the master trust  the master trust assets and liabilities are consolidated into the assets and liabilities of the company 
as a result of the amendment  we recognized million of receivables at fair value  net of intercompany eliminations and retained interests previously carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
previously  transfers of wholesale notes to the master trust were accounted for as sales and accordingly were not carried on our consolidated balance sheets 
there were no remaining outstanding retained interests as of october  and we use another spe  trac  which utilizes a million conduit funding arrangement  which provides for funding of eligible accounts receivable 
subsequent to the adoption of new accounting guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets  transfers of finance receivables from our financial services segment to the trac funding facility completed prior to november  retained their sale accounting treatment while transfers of finance receivables subsequent to november  no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
there were no remaining outstanding retained interests as of october  we had retained interests of million as of october   which were recorded in finance receivables  net 
the trac funding facility is secured by million of retail accounts and million of cash equivalents as of october   and million of retail accounts and million of cash equivalents as of october  the trac funding facility had million and million of outstanding borrowings as of october  and  respectively 
in total  proceeds from the sales of retail notes and wholesale notes that were accounted for as sales and accordingly not carried on the consolidated balance sheet amounted to billion and billion in and  respectively

for more information  see note  property and equipment  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
d amounts include agreements relating to a facility in cherokee  alabama  which we signed in october and will take possession of on january  lease obligations for facility closures are included in operating leases 
future operating lease obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
e purchase obligations include various commitments in the ordinary course of business that would include the purchase of goods or services and they are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments associated with the settlement of audits with taxing authorities because of existing net operating loss carry forwards  the preceding table excludes uncertain tax positions of million 
we do not expect to make significant payments of these liabilities within the next year 
for additional information  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are also required to fund our pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the ppa 
as such  we expect to contribute million in to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least 
table of contents million to the plans per year depending on asset performance and discount rates in the next several years 
for additional information  see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other information income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return for nic and its eligible domestic subsidiaries 
our non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the guidance on accounting for income taxes provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
we believe that our evaluation of deferred tax assets and our maintenance of a valuation allowance against such assets involve critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  estimates of future taxable income in the us and in other non us tax jurisdictions 
these estimates are susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur 
our assessment of the valuation allowance is material to the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet and changes in the valuation allowance may be material to our results of operations 
we intend to continue to assess our valuation allowance in accordance with the guidance on accounting for income taxes 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under the guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting interest and penalties on income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
total interest and penalties related to our uncertain tax positions are immaterial 
as of october  and october   the net amount of liability for uncertain tax provisions was million and million  respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  all but million would impact our effective tax rate 
while it is probable that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease during the next twelve months  we do not expect any such change would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
environmental matters we have been named a prp  in conjunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
these cases involve sites that allegedly received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to us which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and characteristics of material generated at current or former company locations  material allegedly shipped by us to these disposal sites  as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of our share  if any  of the probable costs and accruals are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
these accruals are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
we review all accruals on a regular basis and believe that  based on these calculations  our share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
three sites formerly owned by us  i solar turbines in san diego  california  ii the canton plant in canton  illinois  and iii wisconsin steel in chicago  illinois  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
two sites in sao paulo  brazil  where we are currently operating  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
while investigations and cleanup activities continue at these and other sites  we believe that we have adequate accruals to cover costs to complete the cleanup of all sites 

table of contents impact of environmental regulation government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the us federal and state levels 
because our products use fossil fuels  they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation  such as a cap and trade program  affecting the cost of fuels 
on may   president obama directed the epa and the department of transportation to adopt rules by july  setting greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty engines and vehicles beginning with model year epa and nhtsa issued proposed rules on november  we have been active participants in the discussions surrounding the development of regulations and filed comments with the epa on the proposed rules on january  the final rules  which were issued on september   begin to apply in and are fully implemented in model year the agencies stated goals for these rules were to increase the use of currently existing technologies 
the company plans to comply with these rules through use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available 
in addition to the us  canada  and mexico are also considering the adoption of fuel economy and or greenhouse gas regulations 
we expect that heavy duty fuel economy rules will be under consideration in other global jurisdictions in the future 
these standards will impact development costs for vehicles and engines as well as the cost of vehicles and engines 
there will also be administrative costs arising from the implementation of the rules 
these standards may also create opportunities for the company  which has pursued the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and has sought incentives for the development of technology to improve fuel economy 
our facilities may be subject to regulation related to climate change and climate change may also have some impact on the company operations 
however  these impacts are currently uncertain and the company cannot predict the nature and scope of those impacts 
securitization transactions we finance receivables using a process commonly known as securitization  whereby asset backed securities are sold via public offering or private placement 
in a typical securitization transaction  we transfer a pool of finance receivables to a bankruptcy remote spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated entity  generally a trust or a conduit  in exchange for securities of the trust which are then retained or sold into the public market or privately placed 
these securities are issued by the trust and are secured by future collections on the receivables sold to the trust 
these transactions are subject to the provisions of the guidance on accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
when we securitize receivables  we may have retained interests in the receivables sold transferred 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  undivided interests in receivables and over collateralizations  restricted cash held for the benefit of the trust  and interest only strips 
our retained interests are the first to absorb any credit losses on the transferred receivables because we have the most subordinated interests in the trust  including subordinated securities  the right to receive excess spread interest only strip  and any residual or remaining interests of the trust after all asset backed securities are repaid in full 
our exposure to credit losses on the transferred receivables is limited to our retained interests 
the spe assets are available to satisfy the creditors claims against the assets prior to such assets becoming available for the spe own uses or the uses of our affiliated companies 
since the transfer constitutes a legal sale  we are under no obligation to repurchase any transferred receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
we are not responsible for credit losses on transferred receivables other than through our ownership of the lowest tranches in the securitization structures 
we do not guarantee any securities issued by trusts 
we  as seller and the servicer of the finance receivables  are obligated to provide certain representations and warranties regarding the receivables 
should any of the receivables fail to meet these representations and warranties  we  as servicer  are required to repurchase the receivables 
effective november   none of our wholesale notes  retail notes and finance leases securitization arrangements qualify for sales accounting treatment under the guidance on accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
as a result  such sold receivables and associated secured borrowings are included on the consolidated balance sheet and no gain or loss is recognized for these transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
our assumptions  estimates  and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe are relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
we believe that the 
table of contents following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported results as they require us to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
in determining whether an estimate is critical  we consider if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  or the impact of the estimate and assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to a substantial portion of our employees  former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities  and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rate of compensation increases  and other factors including management plans regarding plant rationalization activities 
changes to our business environment could result in changes to the assumptions  the effects of which could be material 
plant rationalization activities impact the determination of whether a plan curtailment or settlement has occurred 
key considerations include  but are not limited to  expected future service credit  the remaining years of recall rights of the workforce  and the extent to which minimum service requirements in the case of healthcare benefits have been met 
the discount rates are obtained by matching the anticipated future benefit payments for the plans to the citigroup yield curve to establish a weighted average discount rate for each plan 
health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  short term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
the inflation assumptions used are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends 
the expected return on plan assets is derived from historical plan returns  expected long term performance of asset classes  asset allocations  input from an external pension investment advisor  and risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
the focus is on long term trends and provides for the consideration of recent plan performance 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience 
the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and our projected future increases including contractually agreed upon wage rate increases for represented employees 
the sensitivities stated below are based upon changing one assumption at a time  but often economic factors impact multiple assumptions simultaneously 
october  expense obligations pension opeb pension opeb in millions discount rate increase of decrease of expected return on assets increase of na na decrease of na na as modeled above  net periodic postretirement benefits expense is not highly sensitive to changes in discount rates in the current interest rate environment due to the relatively short duration of the closed plans 
for the large us pension plans  a decrease in the discount rate would result in a decrease in interest expense which exceeds the increase in the amortization of losses and higher service costs which would occur under this scenario 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables is established through a charge to the selling  general and administrative expenses 
the allowance is an estimate of the amount required to absorb losses on the existing portfolio of 
table of contents finance receivables that may become uncollectible 
we have two portfolio segments of finance receivables based on the type of financing inherent to each portfolio 
the retail portfolio segment represents loans or leases to end users for the purchase or lease of vehicles 
the wholesale portfolio segment represents loans to dealers to finance their inventory 
as the initial measurement attributes and the monitoring and assessment of credit risk or the performance of the receivables are consistent within each of our receivable portfolios  the company determined that each portfolio consists of one class of receivable 
finance receivables are charged off to the allowance for doubtful accounts when amounts due from the customers are determined to be uncollectible 
the estimate of the required allowance for both the retail portfolio segment and the wholesale portfolio segment is based upon three factors i a historical component based upon a weighted average of actual loss experience from the most recent three years  ii a qualitative component based upon current economic and portfolio quality trends  and iii a specific reserve component 
the qualitative component is the result of analysis of asset quality trend statistics from the most recent four quarters 
in addition  we also analyze specific economic indicators such as tonnage  fuel prices  and gross domestic product for additional insight into the overall state of the economy and its potential impact on our portfolio 
to the extent that our judgments about these risk factors and conditions are not accurate  an adjustment to our allowance for losses may materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 
if we were to apply a hypothetical increase and decrease of ten basis points to the historical loss rate used in calculating the allowance for losses  the required allowance  as of october   would increase from million to million or decrease to million 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at october  and aggregating million and billion  respectively  against such assets based on our assessment of past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
of these amounts  million relate to net operating losses for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
under the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return only  if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting interest and penalties on income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
as of october  and october   the amount of liability for uncertain tax provisions was million and million  respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  all but million would impact our effective tax rate 
however  to the extent we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  the impact may be in the form of an increase in the deferred tax asset related to our nol carry forward  which would be offset by a valuation allowance 
while it is probable that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease during the next twelve months  we do not expect any such change would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets or asset groups other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as discussed below for recoverability when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group 
table of contents include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
if the asset or asset group is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgments in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections and assessing probability weightings to certain business scenarios 
other assets could become impaired in the future or require additional charges as a result of declines in profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  manner in which an asset is used  physical condition of an asset  laws and regulations  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently  if circumstances change or an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit 
in  we did not recognize any material goodwill impairments  and the fair values of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its respective carrying amount by or more 
however  we could recognize goodwill impairment charges in the future if we have declines in profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
indefinite lived intangible assets an intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized until its useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when evaluating if an intangible asset has a finite useful life 
in addition  for indefinite lived intangible assets  significant judgment is applied in testing for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
we could recognize impairment charges in the future as a result of declines in the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which could be material 
contingency accruals product liability lawsuits and claims we are subject to product liability lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
we record product liability accruals for the self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
we obtain a third party actuarial analysis to assist with the determination of the expected ultimate losses for claims and consequently the related reserve on our consolidated balance sheet 
the actual settlement values of outstanding claims in the aggregate may differ from these estimates due to many circumstances including but not limited to the discovery and evolution of information related to individual claims  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  product development trends  and changes in the frequency and or severity of claims relative to historical experience 

table of contents the reserve for product liability was million as of october  and a hypothetical change in claim amount would increase or decrease this accrual by million 
environmental remediation matters we are subject to claims by various governmental authorities regarding environmental remediation matters 
with regard to environmental remediation  many factors are involved including interpretations of local  state  and federal laws and regulations  and whether wastes or other hazardous material are contaminating the surrounding land or water or have the potential to cause such contamination 
as of october   we have accrued million for environmental remediation 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 
asbestos claims we are subject to claims related to illnesses alleged to have resulted from asbestos exposure from component parts found in older vehicles  although some claims relate to the alleged presence of asbestos in our facilities 
numerous factors including tort reform  jury awards  and the number of other solvent companies identified as co defendants will impact the number of claims filed against the company 
the estimate of the asbestos liability is subject to uncertainty 
such uncertainty includes some reliance on industry data to project the future frequency of claims received by us  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposures and the types of diseases that will ultimately manifest  and unexpected future inflationary trends 
historically  actual damages paid out to individual claimants have not been material 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments related to asbestos related claims are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 
product warranty we record a liability for standard and extended warranty for products sold as well as for certain claims outside the contractual obligation period 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
when collection is reasonably assured  we also estimate and recognize the amount of warranty claim recoveries to be received from our suppliers 
product warranty estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
initial warranty estimates for new model year products are based on the previous model year product warranty experience until the product progresses through its life cycle and related claims data becomes mature 
warranty claims are influenced by factors such as new product introductions  technological developments  the competitive environment  and the costs of component parts 
recent emissions standards have resulted in rapid product development cycles and have included significant changes from previous engine models 
we estimate warranty claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize warranty claims 
actual payments for warranty claims could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to the liabilities in future periods 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our warranty accrual that could be material 
recently issued accounting standards accounting guidance that has not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements is described below  together with our assessment of the potential impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on the testing of goodwill impairment to allow an entity the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current two step goodwill impairment testing process is necessary 
under the option  the calculation of the reporting unit fair value is not required to be performed unless as a result of the qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the unit carrying amount 
this new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
our effective date is november  the adoption of this guidance impacts testing steps only  and therefore adoption will not have an 
table of contents impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  our effective date is november  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and to change particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  our effective date is february  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new guidance regarding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosures related to activity in level fair value measurements 
this guidance requires purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements to be presented separately in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
our effective date is november  when effective  we will comply with the disclosure provisions of this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we are also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in our manufacturing operations 
commodity price risk related to our current commodity financial instruments are not material 
we do not hold a material portfolio of market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of our level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables primarily with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables that may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
we measure our interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the fair value of these liabilities would increase by million and million  respectively 
at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the fair value of these assets would decrease by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of commodities  particularly for aluminum  copper  precious metals  resins  diesel fuel  and steel and their impact on the acquisition cost of various parts used in our manufacturing operations 
we have been able to mitigate the effects of price increases via a combination of design changes  material substitution  global sourcing  and price performance 
in certain cases  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to price changes 
during  we purchased approximately million of commodities subject to market risk 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in commodity pricing during  we would have incurred an additional million of costs 
commodity price risk associated with our derivative position at october  and is not material to our operating results or financial position 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar  dollar us dollar  and brazilian real us dollar 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million at october  at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million at october  for further information regarding models  assumptions and parameters related to market risk  please see note  fair value measurements  and note  financial instruments and commodity contracts  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
