a general development of business 
the registrant hereinafter called texas pacific or the trust was organized under a declaration of trust  dated february   to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the state of texas  previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company  and to issue transferable certificates of proprietary interest pro rata to the holders of certain debt securities of the texas and pacific railway company 
the trustees are empowered under the declaration of trust to manage the lands with all the powers of an absolute owner  and to use the lands and the proceeds of sale of the lands  either to pay dividends to the certificate holders or to buy in and cancel outstanding certificates 
the trust s income is derived primarily from land sales  oil and gas royalties  grazing leases  and interest 
this method of operation has continued through the present 
during the last five years there has not been any reorganization  disposition of any material amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business although in the ordinary course of business texas pacific does sell or lease large tracts of land owned by it  or any material change in the mode of conducting business 
texas pacific s income from oil and gas royalties has been limited in the past by the level of production authorized for prorated wells each year by the regulations of the railroad commission of the state of texas 
the monthly percentage of allowable production has averaged in recent years  but  because of the limited capacity of older wells and other operating problems  the percentage permitted by the railroad commission could not be produced by most operators

item a risk factors 
an investment in our securities involves a degree of risk 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or business could be harmed 
in that case  the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
a prolonged downturn in global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business 
our business and results of operations are affected by international  national and regional economic conditions 
financial markets in the united states experienced severe disruption in the second half of and much of the global economy was in a recession 
in  the global economy began a gradual recovery 
while stabilization has begun  the economy remains fragile 
downside risks remain for  including continuing high unemployment  reduced consumer spending and high government deficits 
a recurrence of recessionary conditions or declining economic growth in the united states and elsewhere may lead to reduced industrial production which  in turn  may lead to lower demand and lower prices for oil and gas  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
the trust s oil and gas royalty revenue is dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate 
the oil and gas royalties which the trust receives are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas 
the market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and  in the past  have been subject to significant price fluctuations 
price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years 
although the trust s oil and gas royalties benefited from the substantial increases in the market prices for oil and gas which occurred during  when lower market prices for oil and gas occur they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalty revenues 
the trust is not an oil and gas producer 
its revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others 
the trust is not an oil and gas producer 
its oil and gas income is derived from perpetual non participating oil and gas royalty interests which it has retained 
as wells age the costs of production may increase and their capacity may decline absent additional investment 
however  the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in  and production from  those wells and the trust s royalties will be dependent upon decisions made by those operators  among other factors 
the railroad commission of the state of texas sets authorized production levels for pro rated wells by regulation 
the monthly percentage of allowable production has averaged in recent years 
however  in the past the trust s income from oil and gas royalties has been limited by the production levels authorized by the railroad commission and we cannot assure you that they may not be so limited in the future 
our revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation 
we are a passive seller of land and land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control 
land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the total dollar amount  the average price per acre  and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of land sales in the future 
the trust is a passive seller of land and does not actively solicit sales of land 
the demand for  and the sale price of  any particular tract of the trust s land is influenced by many factors  including  the national and local economies  the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas  livestock carrying capacity and the condition of the local agricultural industry  which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and agricultural products 
approximately of the trust s land is classified as ranch land and intermingled with parcels owned by third parties to form ranching units 
the trust s ability to sell ranch land is  therefore  largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners 
the trust s remaining holdings of land in metropolitan areas are limited 
the sale price of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas is generally substantially higher than the price of land in rural or ranching areas 
the trust s remaining holdings of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas are limited 
if the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares were to be found to be governed by the laws of texas  holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust  to the extent such claims exceeded the assets of the trust 
the declaration of trust which established the trust was executed and delivered in new york 
under the laws of the state of new york  the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares are not subject to any personal liability for the acts or obligations of the trust 
the assets of the trust are located in texas 
under the laws of the state of texas the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares may be held personally liable with respect to claims against the trust  but only after the assets of the trust first have been exhausted 
thus  if a court were to hold that the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares for obligations is governed by the laws of texas  rather than new york  it is possible that holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust to the extent such claims exceeded all of the trust s assets 
the trustees are not subject to annual election and  as a result  the ability of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares to influence the policies of the trust may be limited 
directors of a corporation are generally subject to election at each annual meeting of stockholders or  in the case of staggered boards  at regular intervals 
under the declaration of trust  however  the trust is not required to hold annual meetings of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares to elect trustees and trustees generally hold office until their death  resignation or disqualification 
as a result  the ability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub shares to effect changes in the board of trustees  and the policies of the trust  is significantly more limited than that of the stockholders of a corporation 
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year 
sales of land fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
revenues from oil and gas royalties may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators 
as a result  the results of our operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year

the trust also owns a nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest under  acres of land and a nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest under  acres of land in the western part of texas 
generally speaking  if the trust sells the surface estate in real property with respect to which it holds a perpetual oil and gas royalty interest  that oil and gas royalty interest is excluded from the sale and retained by the trust 
at december   grazing leases were in effect on percent or approximately  acres of the trust s land
