critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition  net realizable value of inventories  provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance  and asset impairments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in relation to this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for those customers who have a hub arrangement  we recognize revenue when our products are transferred from the hub to the customer s manufacturing facility or to its assembly subcontractor s manufacturing facility 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  with the exception of certain products  we defer the recognition of revenue to all our distributors  domestic and foreign  and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end customers 
following a prior period change in our terms and conditions to eliminate return rights for distributors for certain products  we continued to defer revenue recognition until the distributors had sold these parts as we would nonetheless grant concessions and accept some returns for a period of time after the change 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had established sufficient history of not granting such concessions or granting such returns that we began to recognize revenue on such items upon their shipment to the distributors 
we also provide custom processing services for manufacture of ics  using customer owned designs and mask tooling 
under this custom processing service arrangement  a tangible product is sold  and we bear the risk of loss until title is passed on to the customer at the time of shipment 
title to the product under the custom processing service arrangement is passed to the customer at the time of shipment 
from time to time  deferred revenue results from up front billings to customers under non recurring engineering nre contracts 
we recognize revenue from our nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of contract milestones  such as amounts to be received upon delivery of the proto type product  if such a delivery is not an agreed upon milestone 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions in which case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
they are high technology products which are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine net realizable value of our inventories based on the last selling price  net of selling cost  of our products prior to the balance sheet date 
if there has been no recent sale of a particular product  the expected selling price  net of selling cost is deemed as the net realizable value 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to net realizable value is charged to cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
additionally  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next months  which may involve a great deal of management judgment 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are written down 
we make judgments in establishing inventory net book value and do not write down inventory if management believes certain excess or obsolete inventory will be sold within months 
in addition  we age our inventory based on start date 
inventory that has been inactive for more than one year is considered slow moving inventory and is also written down and charged to cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold or scrapped 
any proceeds received will favorably affect gross margin for the period 
while we have programs whose objective is to minimize the required inventories on hand according to the field sales forecast and we consider technological obsolescence when adjusting inventory carrying values to market values  it is possible that future demand or market conditions could be less favorable than our projections  in which case additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
our management must determine the probability that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing income tax expense 
as of april   we believe that our deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to utilize or recover our deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
on february   california enacted tax related economic incentives and tax increases which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula for most businesses starting in tax years beginning on or after january  as a result  we revalued our california deferred tax assets expected to be realized 
the authoritative guidance of income taxes provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this authoritative guidance also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
this authoritative guidance requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and consequently affect our operating results 
the reserve amount associated with this authoritative guidance was determined with considerable judgment and estimation  and is continuously monitored by management based on the best information available including changes in tax regulations  the outcome of relevant court cases  ongoing tax audits  and other information 
during the fiscal year ended april   the liability for uncertain tax positions less accrued interest and penalties decreased from  to  of the total  of uncertain tax benefits   represents the amount that if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
we cannot conclude on the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions 
accounting for available for sale investments our available for sale portfolio in fiscal includes municipal bonds  corporate bonds  ars  government agency bonds  discount notes and certificates of deposits 
these securities are reported at fair value 
the ars held by us are primarily backed by pools of student loans and are guaranteed by the united states department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of ars  the fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model and included a discount factor for illiquidity of the ars market 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amounts of cash flows  liquidity of the underlying security  expected holding periods and contractual terms of the security 
we review our securities for impairments in accordance with the authoritative guidance and other related guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to the statement of income and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
in light of the current market condition for ars  we developed different scenarios for the significant inputs used in the discounted cash flow model  including  but not limited to liquidity discount of basis points for the current ars market  and the timing of recovery of ars market from three to six years 
the estimated fair value of our ars ranges from  to  or to of par value 
we believe this estimated range of fair value of our ars is appropriate taking into consideration historical ars market data  the possibility of development of a secondary market for ars  recent market participant behaviors  and public policy implications associated with the student loan based ars market 
we concluded that the fair value of our ars was  or of par value  as of april  and recorded a temporary impairment of  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments we operate in the highly cyclical global semiconductor market  evidenced by fluctuating demand cycles for our products 
during fiscal years through we experienced sales growth  however sales declined in fiscal and primarily due to a reduction in demand from one of our significant customers  as its products that use our el inverter ics experienced significantly reduced sales  and due to the global recession which began in the second half of fiscal and continued through the first half of fiscal our overall custom processing services sales experienced alternating years of growth and decline during fiscal through  with and being growth years 
we have not focused on expanding this portion of our business because its gross profit is generally low even though it does add to our fab capacity utilization 
during the second half of fiscal  overall sales of products in all of our target markets increased compared to the first half  following their decline in the recent global recession that began for us in the third quarter of fiscal during the recession  quarterly sales run rate reduced from a previous level of approximately  to a trough of  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal sales were  and  respectively 
sales continued to grow in the first quarter of fiscal  as demand increased for our medical ultrasound pulsers and analog switches  our telecom optical mems drivers  and our led general lighting and backlighting products 
however  overall sales declined consecutively during the last three quarters of fiscal primarily due to the combined effect of reductions of medical ultrasound customer end user demand and to a lesser extent increased competition  and due to lower customer end user demand for our el inverters  as well as reduction in content per tv and customer in sourcing of our led backlighting drivers 
counter to the cyclical trends experienced by most of our target markets during the past five years  combined sales of our led general lighting and backlighting products steadily increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal but were slightly down in to  results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we operate in one business segment comprised of the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of high voltage analog and mixed signal ics  dmos transistors and arrays 
a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the medical electronics  led lighting  imaging  telecom  and industrial other markets as well as year over year changes are shown below fiscal years ended year over year dollars in thousands april  april  change medical electronics imaging led lighting telecom industrial other total net sales we have a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
the increase in net sales compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the overall economic recovery which began in our second half of fiscal sales continued to increase sequentially through the first quarter of fiscal and then declined in the last three quarters of fiscal due to the combined effect of reductions in demand for medical ultrasound products resulting from adjustment in channel inventory  seasonality and competition  for el drivers  and for led backlighting drivers resulting from in sourcing of an led backlighting driver by our major led tv customer 
total fiscal sales increased in all four of our target markets except for led lighting where a steep decline in sales of led driver ics for backlighting lcd tvs that employ led backlighting led tvs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year resulted in a material annual decline in such sales which offset sales increases in our led driver ic s for general lighting 
our sales to the medical electronics market accounted for of total sales in fiscal and increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase was due to increased shipments of our analog switches and high voltage pulser circuits and chipsets resulting primarily from the strengthening of the overall economy  partially offset by lower custom processing services demand from our medical instrument customers 
in recent years  the overall ultrasound market has been shifting from big console systems to transportable and hand carried ultrasound imaging units  which has driven the ultrasound imaging market growth along with product upgrades for console cart wheel machines and large stationary systems 
because of space and power constraints  there are more requirements for integration  and with our high voltage ic technology we have been among the most qualified to support these requirements 
geographically  the imaging equipment market is expanding very rapidly in china  india and many african countries 
traditionally  oems in the united states  germany  and japan have been the main developers and manufacturers of medical ultrasound imaging machines to whom we have sold our products successfully 
companies in those regions continue to grow and develop new machines 
today we see significant opportunities with medical ultrasound imaging machine companies in china and korea 
this market began to grow for us in fiscal and continued in fiscal the global economic slowdown which began in the second half of fiscal and carried through the second quarter of fiscal negatively impacted sales of capital equipment  including medical ultrasound imaging machines 
due to the global economic improvement  the global demand for medical ultrasound imaging machines picked up in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal and continued through the second quarter of fiscal however  in addition to our normal seasonal decline in the third and fourth quarters  we experienced declines resulting from the impact of increased competition 
we are expanding our product development activities and product offerings to capitalize on these exciting market growth opportunities 
through the introduction of our new integrated solutions along with our discrete transistor and array building block product offerings  we believe we will continue to be a major player in this business 
sales to the imaging market  which largely consist of el inverter ics  commercial printing ics  display ics and custom processing services  in fiscal increased compared to the prior year 
this was primarily due to increased sales of our display and commercial printing ics and increased custom processing services  both resulting from the improved economy and due to higher shipments of our el inverter ics for mobile phones 
we are one of the key providers of el driver ics for backlighting cell phones keypads and are also pursuing el backlighting applications in other products  such as keyboard backlighting for netbooks  notebooks and laptops 
in addition  we are one of the key providers of driver ics for hand held instruments and watches and the leading supplier in the high end industrial printer market with both standard and custom products 
sales to the led lighting market decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease resulted from a reduction in shipments of our high voltage led driver ics for led tvs due to a reduction in dollar content per tv of our led drivers  our major customer insourcing these drivers beginning in our third fiscal quarter  and the global slowdown of tv sales 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in led driver sales for general lighting 
we expect shipments of our general lighting drivers to continue to increase during fiscal which will drive increases in our overall sales to the led lighting market from the current quarterly run rate 
sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in sales was primarily due to significantly higher shipments of our high voltage driver ics for optical to optical switching applications because of the strengthening of the global economy and the increasing demand for video streaming and higher bandwidth 
sales to the industrial other market increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the strengthening of the overall economy that began in the second half of fiscal our current growth strategy relies on our ability to continuously and successfully introduce and market new innovative products that meet our customers requirements 
our principal geographic markets are in asia  the us  and europe 
sales by geographic regions as well as year over year percentage changes were as follows 
the sales amounts are based on where we ship our products to  rather than where the customers headquarters are located

this increase in international net sales was primarily due to the strengthening of the global economy and the increase in sales of our drivers of led general lighting products due to the penetration of led lighting in several lighting applications 
the increase in sales to the united states was primarily due to the strengthening of the global economy 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and net charges for excess or obsolete inventory

we also expense prototype experimental wafers and mask sets related to new products development as r d expenses 
the year over year decrease of  in r d expense was primarily due to reduced employee stock compensation expense of  a reduced expense of  related to the company s non qualified deferred compensation plan nqdcp as the plan assets increased in fair value by  compared to  during fiscal  and reduced employee compensation expense of  an increase or decrease in the fair value of the company ndqcp assets corresponds to an increase or decrease in the ndqcp liability 
to recognize the increase or decrease in the ndqcp plan assets  the company records the difference in fair value to other income expense net 
correspondingly  to recognize the increase or decrease in the ndqcp liability  the company records the difference to other benefits expense 
the decrease in percentage of net sales is primarily due to the increased sales

the decrease in interest income in fiscal was due to a shift in our investment portfolio from higher yielding ars to other short term securities  partially offset by interest income generated by higher cash and investment balance 
other income expense  net was  lower compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in fair value of investments held by the company s nqdcp of  in fiscal compared to an increase of  in fiscal  partially offset by a  gain on sale of equipment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  at an effective tax rate of  compared to  at an effective tax rate of in our effective tax rate of was less than the combined federal and state tax rate due to the domestic production activities deduction  the benefits of r d credits  tax exempt investment income  and shifts of income among jurisdictions with different tax rates  partially offset by the adverse impact of a valuation allowance recorded against california deferred tax assets 
during the quarter ended october   we identified the inclusion of certain r d expenses in the calculation of the r d tax credit which were not in compliance with irs regulations 
as a result  the income tax expense for the quarter ended december  and year ended april  was understated by  this amount was corrected in the three months ended october  we assessed the materiality of this adjustment on the prior periods and concluded that it was not material to those periods 
we also concluded that the out of period adjustment  which resulted in a  increase in tax expense for the fiscal year ended april   was not material to such period

this sales decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling prices of analog switches and high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and chipsets due to increased competition  and to a lesser extent due to lower unit shipments of our analog switches and high voltage ultrasound pulser ics and chipsets due to the weak overall economy 
sales to the led lighting market in fiscal increased compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to significantly increased shipments of our high voltage led driver ics for backlighting lcd tvs with led backlighting units led tvs which have ramped up volume production during the past several quarters at a tier one oem prior to a decline in the fourth quarter as the customer transitioned to its models which use our new drivers which allow longer led strings and fewer drivers per tv set 
during fiscal we also began shipping production quantities to three second tier oems 
additionally  general lighting led application sales have increased compared to fiscal sales to the imaging market in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to significantly reduced demand for our customers products and the weak overall economy 
this was partially offset by increased shipments of our el inverter ics to a hand set oem for a new family of products during the second half of fiscal in the other major component of our imaging market  drivers for non impact inkjet printers and plotters as well as other displays  sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the overall weak economy  however  during our second half of fiscal sales of these products increased compared to the first half

financial condition overview total cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments balance as of april   was  compared with  on april   and  on march  the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from  of cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from exercises of stock options and espp of  and a reduction in impairment of  on the ars  partially offset by purchases of the company s stock of  and capital expenditures of  working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
working capital was  an increase of  from  as of april  this increase in working capital was mostly the result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of  and partial redemptions of our ars of  which were reinvested in short term securities 
liquidity and capital resources in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended april  april  march  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
the increase of  compared to the prior year resulted from a greater net income after non cash adjustments of  partially offset by a decrease from changes in assets and liabilities totaling  the increased non cash adjustments to net income were  and resulted primarily from a decrease in deferred income taxes  compared to an increase last year and a lower unrealized gain from short term investments 
these changes in non cash adjustments were partially offset by decreases due to lower depreciation expense  a reduction in provision for excess and obsolete inventories due to increased overall demand  and lower stock based compensation 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced cash provided by operating activities due to an increase in prepaid taxes compared to a decrease last year  a greater increase in inventories compared to last year as production increased in the first half of fiscal in anticipation of increased sales which did not materialize  a lesser increase in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and a decrease in deferred revenue 
these reductions to cash were partially offset by a reduction in trade accounts receivable due to decreased sales during the second half of fiscal compared to an increase in the second half of fiscal  and due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments and redemptions of long term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we received par value redemptions of our ars totaling  partially offsetting this was  of greater purchases than disposals of short term investments and capital expenditure of  our capital expenditures in fiscal were devoted primarily to equipment to expand our test capacity and to upgrades of our software and computer hardware 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of municipal bonds  corporate bonds  ars  government agency bonds  discount notes and certificates of deposits 
as further described in note  auction failures have limited and we expect will continue to limit our ability to liquidate our ars for some period of time 
however  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
as of april   we had approximately  of working capital  including approximately  of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and we have generated cash from our operations for the past several years 
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal was  due to repurchases of our shares from the open market  partially offset by proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
in contrast  in fiscal when cash provided by financing activities was  we did not repurchase any shares 
we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal we believe that we have substantial production capacity in place to handle any projected increase in business in fiscal almost all of our  book value of property  plant and equipment are located in the united states and hong kong 
we also believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements through the next twelve months even were we to be able to repurchase the approximately remaining million of shares we are targeting in the next two years in our share repurchase program 
fiscal operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended april   net cash provided by operating activites was  compared to  in fiscal this decrease of  resulted from a lesser net income after non cash adjustments of  and a decrease from changes in assets and liabilities totaling  the lower non cash adjustments were primarily an unrealized gain from short term investments compared to an unrealized loss last year and a reduction in deferred income taxes compared to an increase last year  partially offset by higher provision for excess and obsolete inventories due to reduced overall demand during the first half of fiscal  and higher stock based compensation expense 
also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were increased trade accounts receivable due to a significant increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to a decrease in the second half of fiscal  and due to increases in prepaid expenses and inventories  while income taxes payable decreased 
these changes in non cash adjustments were partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable  prepaid income taxes and deferred revenue  as our distributors increased the amount of inventory being carried  while in fiscal they decreased inventories 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments  partially offset by sales of short term investments and redemptions of long term investments 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we bought  more of short term investments than we sold 
partially offsetting this use of cash were par value redemptions of our ars totaling  our capital expenditures in fiscal of  were lower than in fiscal financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the and plans and sales of stock through the espp  reclassification of non cash excess tax benefit from operating into financing activities  and repurchases of stock on the open market 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares from the open market 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
noted below under contractual obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business such as lease commitments  open purchase obligations and other items that are not recorded on our balance sheet  since we have not yet received the related goods or services as of april  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at april   which consist of operating facility leases and open volume purchase orders which provide volume discounts 
such obligations are expected to have minimal effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through april rental expense amounted to  for fiscal rental expenses were  net of sublease income of  in fiscal as of april   the liability for uncertain tax positions  net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments  state income taxes  interest deductions  and other receivables was  as of april   we had accumulated balances for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense of  and  respectively 
for the year ended april   we recorded estimated interest of  and estimated penalties of  we cannot conclude on the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions 
common stock repurchases share repurchase activities for fiscal years ended april  and april  were as follows fiscal years ended april  april  number of shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased average price per share since the inception of these repurchase programs in through april   we have repurchased a total of approximately  shares of the common stock for an aggregate cost of  upon their repurchase  shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares 
as of april   there were approximately  shares authorized for future repurchase under our current program 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  fasb issued new authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this amendment attempts to clarify the board s intent on the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements as well as change to a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks primarily due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our investment securities 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments  and our holdings are for purposes other than trading 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of municipal bonds  corporate bonds  ars  government agency bonds  discount notes and certificates of deposits 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
based on our investments and cash and cash equivalent balance as of april   one percentage point change in interest rates would cause change in our annual interest income by an amount of approximately  ars are subject to the risk that the secondary market might fail to provide the liquidity opportunity at the rate reset points 
this risk  which we have encountered with regard to our ars  manifests itself in sponsoring broker dealers withdrawing from the auction process that provides the rate reset and liquidity 
we recorded a  temporary impairment in value as of april   which decreased from  as of april   due to our reduced ars holdings resulting from several ars redemptions 
in the event we need to access the funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
the ars we hold had contractual maturities generally between to years and had a total par value of  as of april   compared to  as of april  they are in the form of auction rate bonds backed by a pool of student loans  whose interest rates were reset every seven to thirty five days through an auction process prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the ars held by us are backed by student loans and are guaranteed by the united states department of education 
in addition  all ars held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
as our ars are of high credit rating  we believe the credit risk is very low 
if the issuer of the ars is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the ars  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
however  we expect that we will receive the principal associated with these ars through one of the means described above 
foreign currency exchange risks we do not hedge any potential risk from any foreign currency exposure 
with our operations in hong kong  we face exposure to an adverse change in the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar 
we believe that our exposure is relatively small  thus we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate this foreign currency exposure 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as the level of activity at this operation changes over time  actual currency gains or losses could have an adverse impact to the consolidated financial statements 
our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm the business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies
