item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was organized as a self advised reit in the state of maryland in june  with a focus on investments in primarily upper upscale hotel properties in major business and convention markets and  on a selective basis  premium select service and extended stay hotel properties in urban settings or unique locations in the us we believe current industry dynamics have and will continue to create attractive opportunities to acquire high quality hotel properties  at prices well below replacement costs  with attractive yields on investment and significant upside potential 
we completed our initial public offering in january and have since acquired or committed to acquire the following six hotel properties hotel property location rooms acquisition date hyatt regency boston boston  ma march  hilton checkers los angeles los angeles  ca june  courtyard anaheim at disneyland resort anaheim  ca july  boston marriott newton newton  ma july  le meridien san francisco san francisco  ca december  homewood suites seattle convention center seattle  wa under contract in mid  us lodging demand started to decline as a result of the economic recession which led industry revpar to decline for the year  as reported by smith travel research 
throughout  the decrease in lodging demand accelerated with revpar down for the year  the largest decline recorded by smith travel research since they began tracking the us lodging industry 
in the first quarter of  fundamentals in the us lodging industry began showing trends of improvement with demand for rooms increasing in almost all of the major markets  as general economic indicators began to experience improvement 
with lodging demand increasing  pricing power began to return in the second quarter of in a few of the major leading markets such as new york  ny  boston  ma  and washington  dc  with gains in adr for the first time since the economic recession started 
these positive trends continued  strengthened and expanded to other markets during the third and fourth quarters of revpar increased in as compared to  as reported by smith travel research  which was stronger than had been anticipated in the industry 
for  we expect an even greater increase in revpar  which we believe will be led primarily by gains in adr resulting from shifts in business mix and rate negotiations as occupancy levels have stabilized 
furthermore  with supply of available rooms expected to rise at a significantly slower pace over the next several years than during  we expect these meaningful growth trends to be supported for several years to come 
the acquisition environment and deal activity has increased throughout the year  and has gained considerable momentum in the last half of the year 
while there are numerous sources  much of the deal activity is coming from private sellers experiencing challenges with their current hotel holdings and underlying capital structure 
many owners have some equity remaining in their hotels  but cannot refinance their existing debt  which in many cases is coming due 
as well  these owners may not have the needed capital to reinvest in the hotel and for others  they may have fund life issues with the need to begin returning capital to their investors 
in addition  there are public sellers that are selling for strategic reasons  whether it s a brand company or another reit 
all of these forces are driving much of the current deal activity 
we have seen the bid ask spread closing in many situations as sellers become more realistic in their expectations given debt coming due or fund life issues and buyers are able and willing to pay more as industry fundamentals continue to improve 
the environment remains competitive  however  we feel strongly that we can continue to acquire hotels and prudently deploy capital 
we believe the opportunities today are compelling and will be viewed as significantly discounted entry points as the lodging cycle continues to grow through a multi year recovery period

in  we declared two quarterly dividends each in the amount of per common share  of which the first was paid on october  to each shareholder of record on september  and the second was paid on january  to each shareholder of record on december  we expect to continue declaring distributions to shareholders  as required to maintain our reit status  although no assurances can be made that we will continue to generate sufficient income to distribute similar aggregate amounts in the future 
the per share 
table of contents amounts of future distributions will depend on the number of our common and preferred shares outstanding from time to time and will be determined by our board of trustees following its periodic review of our financial performance and capital requirements  and the terms of our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our primary source of cash to meet operating requirements  including payment of dividends in accordance with the reit requirement of the us federal income tax laws  payment of interest on any borrowings and funding of any capital expenditures  will be from our hotels results of operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we intend to incur indebtedness to supplement our investment capital and to maintain flexibility to respond to industry conditions and opportunities 
we intend to target an overall debt level of of the aggregate purchase prices of all of our portfolio properties 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as new hotel property acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through additional secured and unsecured borrowings and issuances of equity securities 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on  among other things  general market conditions for hotel companies and reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze alternate sources of capital in an effort to minimize our capital costs and maximize our financial flexibility 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement to obtain a million  two year secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
on january   we amended the credit agreement to increase the maximum amount we may borrow to million  and to provide for the possibility of further future increases  up to a maximum of million  in accordance with the terms of the amended credit agreement 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility allows for a one year extension 
the credit agreement contains standard financial covenants  including certain leverage ratios  coverage ratios  and a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility is based on the value of our hotel properties included in the borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   the maximum borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was million  of which million had been drawn 
see note  long term debt  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and other long term debt 
we currently have the room homewood suites seattle convention center under contract for a purchase price of million  plus customary pro rated amounts and closing costs 
we expect to fund the purchase price by assuming approximately million of existing mortgage debt and with available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have already deposited million under the purchase and sale agreement  which is non refundable except in the event of a default under the purchase and sale agreement by the seller or expressly otherwise provided by the purchase and sale agreement 
there can be no assurances that we will complete this acquisition 
capital expenditures we maintain each hotel property in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and the agreed upon requirements in our management and loan agreements 
the cost of all such routine improvements and alterations will be paid out of property improvement reserves  which will be funded by a portion of each hotel s gross revenues 
routine capital expenditures will be administered by the management companies 
however  we will have approval rights over the capital expenditures as part of the annual budget process 
from time to time  certain of our hotel properties may be undergoing renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotels  such as guestrooms  meeting space  and or restaurants  in order to better compete 
table of contents with other hotels in our markets 
in addition  often after we acquire a hotel property  we are required to complete a property improvement plan pip in order to bring the hotel property up to the respective franchisor s standards 
if permitted by the terms of the management agreement  funding for a renovation will first come from the property improvement reserve 
to the extent that the property improvement reserve is not adequate to cover the cost of the renovation  we will fund the remaining portion of the renovation with cash and cash equivalents on hand 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
there were no other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years corporate office lease revolving credit facility  including interest term loan  including interest assumes no additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan and interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect as of december  also assumes that no extension options are exercised 
see note  long term debt  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and term loan 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in the winter months 
we expect that our operations will generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
accordingly  we expect that we will have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
these general trends are  however  expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments in hotel properties we allocate the purchase prices of hotel properties acquired based on the fair value of the acquired property  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of the liabilities assumed 
in making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating the purchase price  we utilize a number of sources of information that are obtained in connection with the acquisition of a hotel property  including cost segregation studies and valuations performed by independent third parties 
we also consider information obtained about each hotel property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
hotel property acquisition costs  such as 
table of contents transfer taxes  title insurance  environmental and property condition reviews  and legal and accounting fees  are expensed in the period incurred 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally to years for buildings and building improvements and three to ten years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets 
replacements and improvements at the hotel properties are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
upon the sale or retirement of a fixed asset  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets are recorded on non market contracts  including air rights and lease  management and franchise agreements  assumed as part of the acquisition of certain hotel properties 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contracts acquired 
contracts acquired which are at market do not have significant value 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related contracts 
we review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel property exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
share based compensation from time to time  we grant restricted share awards to employees 
to date  we have granted two types of restricted share awards time based awards and performance based awards 
we measure share based compensation expense for the restricted share awards based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of time based awards is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the measurement date  which is generally the date of grant 
the fair value of performance based awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation performed by a third party valuation specialist 
a monte carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions  including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our common shares and the price of the common shares of our peer group  a risk free rate of return  and an expected term 
for time based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the entire award 
for performance based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each award 
for both time based awards and performance based awards  once the total amount of share based compensation expense is determined on the date of the grant  no adjustments are made to the amount recognized each period 
no share based compensation expense is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
revenue recognition hotel revenues  including room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
these disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
the new accounting guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the new disclosures on january  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we earn interest income from cash and cash equivalent balances 
considering our current cash and cash equivalents  if interest rates increase or decrease by  our interest income will increase or decrease by less than million  respectively 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan 
amounts borrowed under each our revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus  subject to a libor floor of 
because the prevailing libor is below the interest rate floor  if prevailing libor on our debt under our revolving credit facility and term loan were to decrease  we would not experience any benefits in terms of reduced interest expense 
conversely  if applicable libor were to increase to reach  or a increase over the interest rate floor in effect  the increase in interest expense on our debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually  assuming that the amount outstanding under each our revolving credit facility and term loan were to remain at million and million  respectively  the balances at december
