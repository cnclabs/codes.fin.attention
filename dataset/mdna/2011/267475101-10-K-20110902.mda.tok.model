we place and splice fiber  copper  and coaxial cables 
in addition  we excavate trenches in which to place these cables  place related structures such as poles  anchors  conduits  manholes  cabinets and closures  place drop lines from main distribution lines to the consumer s home or business  and maintain and remove these facilities 
these services are provided to both telephone companies and cable television multiple system operators in connection with the deployment of new networks and the expansion or maintenance of existing networks 
we provide civil and tower construction  lines and antenna installation  and foundation and equipment pad construction for wireless carriers  as well as equipment and material fabrication and site testing services 
for cable television system operators  we install and maintain customer premise equipment such as digital video recorders  set top boxes and modems 
premise wiring 
premise wiring services are provided to various companies  as well as state and local governments 
these services include the installation  repair and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure within improved structures 
underground facility locating services 
we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
under various state laws excavators are required  prior to excavating  to request from utility companies the location of their underground facilities in order to prevent utility network outages and to safeguard the general public from the consequences of damages to underground utilities 
utility companies are required to respond within specified time periods to these requests to mark underground and buried facilities 
our underground facility locating services include locating telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas lines 
electric and gas utilities and other construction and maintenance services 
we perform construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers 
these services are performed primarily on a stand alone basis and typically include installing and maintaining overhead and underground power distribution lines 
in addition  we periodically provide these services for the combined projects of telecommunication providers and electric utility companies  primarily in joint trenching situations  in which services are being delivered to new housing subdivisions 
we also maintain and install underground natural gas transmission and distribution systems for gas utilities 

table of contents revenues by type of customer the following table represents the percentage of total contract revenues by type of customer fiscal year ended telecommunications underground facility locating electric and gas utilities and other customers total contract revenues business strategy capitalize on long term growth drivers 
we are well positioned to benefit from increased demand for reliable video  voice  and data services 
as telecommunications networks experience increased demand for services  our customers must expand the capacity and improve the performance of their existing networks and  in certain instances  deploy new networks 
this is increasingly important to our customers as the service offerings of telephone and cable companies converge  with each offering reliable  competitively priced voice  video  and data services to consumers 
additionally  there is a significant increase in demand for mobile broadband driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices 
our customers networks  both wireline and wireless  are increasingly facing demands for greater capacity and reliability which increases the demand for the services we provide 
selectively increase market share 
we believe our reputation for high quality service and our ability to provide services nationally create opportunities for expanding our market share 
our decentralized operating structure and numerous points of contact within customer organizations position us favorably to win new opportunities with existing customers 
our significant financial resources enable us to address larger opportunities which some of our relatively capital constrained competitors may be unable to perform 
however  we do not intend to increase market share by pursuing unprofitable work 
pursue disciplined financial and operating strategies 
we manage the financial aspects of our business by centralizing certain activities which allow us to reduce costs through leveraging our scope and scale 
functions such as treasury  tax and risk management  the approval of capital equipment procurements  the design of employee benefit plans  as well as the review and promulgation of best practices in certain other aspects of our operations are centralized 
additionally  we centralize efforts in information technology that are designed to support and enhance our operating efficiency 
in contrast  we decentralize the recording of transactions and the financial reporting necessary for timely operational decisions 
we believe this decentralization provides greater accountability for business outcomes from our local decision makers 
we also maintain a decentralized approach to marketing  field operations  and ongoing customer service  empowering local managers to capture new business and execute contracts on a timely and cost effective basis 
this approach enables us to utilize our capital resources effectively and efficiently  while retaining the organizational agility necessary to compete with our predominantly small  privately owned local competitors 
pursue selective acquisitions 
we selectively pursue acquisitions when we believe doing so is operationally and financially beneficial  although we do not rely on acquisitions solely for growth 
in particular  we pursue acquisitions that we believe will provide us with incremental revenue and geographic diversification while complementing our existing operations 
we generally target companies for acquisition that have defensible leadership positions in their market niches  profitability which meets or exceeds industry averages  proven operating histories  sound management  and certain clearly identifiable cost synergies 

table of contents customer relationships our current customers include leading telephone companies such as at t  centurylink  verizon  windstream  frontier communications corporation  and t mobile 
we also provide telecommunications engineering  construction  installation and maintenance services to a number of cable television multiple system operators  including comcast  charter  time warner cable  cablevision  bright house networks and cox communications  inc premise wiring services are provided to various companies  as well as state and local governments 
our underground facility locating services are provided to telecommunication providers and to a variety of utility and gas companies  including duke energy  edison international  agl services company  washington gas light company  and baltimore gas and electric 
we also provide construction and maintenance services to a number of electric and gas utility companies  including xcel energy inc and questar gas 
our customer base is highly concentrated  with our current top five customers for fiscal accounting for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  approximately of our total revenues was derived from at t  from comcast  from centurylink  from verizon  and from charter 
we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenues and operating income will continue to be derived from a concentrated group of customers 
a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years 
we are currently a party to over of these agreements 
master service agreements generally contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers  perform work with the customer s own employees  and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice 
a customer s decision to engage us with respect to a specific construction or maintenance project is often made by local customer management working with our subsidiaries 
as a result  although our project work is concentrated among relatively few customers  our relationships with these customers are generally broad and extend deeply into their organizations 
historically  master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process  however  we have been able to extend some of these agreements on a negotiated basis 
we also enter into both long term and short term single project contracts with our customers 
our markets are served locally by dedicated and experienced personnel 
management of our subsidiaries possess intimate knowledge of their particular markets and we believe our decentralized operations allow us to be more responsive in addressing customer needs 
our sales and marketing efforts are the responsibility of management  including management of our subsidiaries 
these marketing efforts tend to focus on contacts with managers within our customers organizations 
backlog our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate  particularly in light of current economic conditions and the uncertainty those conditions may create regarding our customer s requirements for our services 
our backlog totaled billion and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal 
table of contents safety and risk management we are committed to ensuring that our employees perform their work safely and we regularly communicate with our employees to reinforce that commitment and instill safe work habits 
the safety directors of our subsidiaries review accidents and claims for our operations  examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues 
claims arising in our business generally include workers compensation claims  various general liability and damage claims  and claims related to vehicle accidents  including personal injury and property damage 
we insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in substantially all of the states in which we operate 
in addition  we retain risk of loss  up to certain limits  under our employee group health plan 
we carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments 
the estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities  and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year  insurance accruals have varied and can affect the consistency of our operating margins 
if we experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly fragmented 
it is characterized by a large number of participants  including several large companies as well as a significant number of small  privately owned  local competitors 
we also face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing and prospective customers  particularly telecommunications providers that employ personnel who perform some of the same services that we provide 
although a significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by our customers and we have been performing specialty contracting services for over years  our existing and prospective customers may elect to discontinue outsourcing specialty contracting services in the future 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from master service agreements and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements 
accordingly  we may be underbid by our competitors if they elect to price their services lower to procure such business 
our competitors may also develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
the principal competitive factors for our services include geographic presence  breadth of service offerings  worker and general public safety  price  quality of service  and industry reputation 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 
employees as of july   we employed  persons 
approximately of our employees are employed subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the number of our employees varies according to the level of our work in progress 
we maintain a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and add employees as needed to complete specific projects 
materials and subcontractors for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all materials required while we provide the necessary personnel  tools  and equipment 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
under contracts where we are required to supply part or all of the materials  we are not generally dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily use to complete projects 
we do not manufacture any significant amounts of material for resale 
we use independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we may otherwise be required to spend on fixed assets and working capital 
these independent subcontractors typically are small locally owned companies 
independent subcontractors provide their own employees  vehicles  tools  and insurance coverage 
we do not rely on any single independent subcontractor 

table of contents seasonality our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result of these factors  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
environmental matters a significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers 
as a result  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous substances 
additionally  environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described below 
if any of the risks described below  or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or the company s other sec filings  were to occur  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  if other risks not presently known to us  or that we do not currently believe to be significant  occur or become significant  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
economic downturns and or challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers future spending 
we experienced a challenging business environment during fiscal and as a result of the economic slowdown and adverse developments in the financial and credit markets 
economic downturns may adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers 
this makes it difficult to estimate our customers requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog 
our customers generally finance their projects through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt  or the issuance of equity 
as a result  volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers 
this may result in a reduction in our customers spending for our services  which could adversely affect our operations 
demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve 
demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry 
our results for fiscal and fiscal were impacted by customer reductions in near term spending plans 
although we experienced an improved operating environment in fiscal  there is no guarantee that future downturns will not occur 
during times of economic slowdown  our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
in addition  our underground facility locating services are influenced by the level of overall economic activity 
as a result of the foregoing  demand for our services may decline during periods of economic weakness adversely affecting our operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenues from master service agreements 
by their terms  the majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers upon notice  regardless of whether or not we are in default 
in addition  our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements 
consequently  projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed 
furthermore  our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts 
as a result  we could be underbid by our competitors or required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid 
the loss of work obtained through master service agreements or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
the industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological  structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and changing consumer demands 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry 
new technologies  or upgrades to existing technologies by customers  could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
new  developing  or existing services  such as wireless applications  could displace the wireline systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses 
in addition  improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
our customer base is highly concentrated  with our current top five customers for fiscal accounting for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers  our revenue may significantly decline 
in addition  revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in house service organizations 
additionally  the consolidation  merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity 
the loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents the specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with other specialty contractors  including numerous small  privately owned companies  as well as several companies that may have financial  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
additionally  our competitors may develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we also face competition from the in house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide 
although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our industry competitors  we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future 
our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data 
in some instances  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  purchase price allocations  the fair value of goodwill  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  income taxes  accrued insurance claims  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
at the time they are made  we believe that such estimates are fair based on the information available 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
as the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract  our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract 
our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
any changes in original cost estimates  or the assumptions underpinning such estimates  may result in changes to costs and income 
these changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits 
we possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets 
we extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work 
these customers include telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators  and gas and electric utilities and others 
at july   we had net accounts receivable of million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million 
we periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments 
slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
furthermore  bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
the failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability 
we retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities  which leaves us exposed to higher than expected claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
we estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
however  the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision 
these factors include the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated  or should the dollar amount of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies accrued insurance claims and note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 

table of contents our backlog is subject to reduction and or cancellation 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate 
if our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits  this could adversely affect our future earnings and the price of our common stock 
we may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
any such write down could adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of our interim impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a non cash charge of million 
the fiscal interim impairment charge included impairments at the following reporting units broadband installation services for million  c utility contractors for million  ervin cable construction for million  nichols construction for million  stevens communications for million  and utiliquest for million 
as the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill in fiscal  we recognized non cash charges of approximately million related to our stevens communications reporting unit and approximately million related to our nichols construction reporting unit 
additionally  in fiscal and  we recognized non cash charges of approximately million related to our white mountain cable construction reporting unit and million related to our can am communications reporting unit  respectively 
the impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill related to these reporting units 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
specifically  during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations  cash flow  and liquidity  and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings  including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions  including class action lawsuits  that are brought or threatened against us for alleged violations of the fair labor standards act the flsa and state wage and hour laws 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement  mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves 
for a description of current legal proceedings  see legal proceedings and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries 
our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry  and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy 
although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time 
the loss of key management could adversely affect our operations 
we do not carry significant key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ  train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy 
our ability to do so depends on a number of factors  such as general rates of employment  competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees 
in addition  our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 

table of contents we may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations  or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations 
we utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects 
if we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all  we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase 
in addition  we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of the work they performed 
any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service  our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business  and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers 
fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts 
as a result  higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments  underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that  at any given time  we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs 
to the extent we enter into hedge transactions  declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
delays in the receipt of materials could result in delays in the performance of our services 
there is an increased demand for fiber optic cable because our customers are expanding the capacity of their networks 
in addition  fiber optic cable suppliers have experienced and could further experience delays in the delivery of materials 
while there have not been significant delays to date  future delays could adversely affect the timing of the construction and maintenance services we provide to our customers 
our results of operations fluctuate seasonally 
our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result of these factors  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
we may be unable to generate internal growth 
our internal growth may be affected by  among other factors  our ability to offer the services our existing customers require  attract new customers  and hire and retain qualified employees or independent subcontractors 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth  such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees  may be beyond our control 
should one or more of these factors occur  we may not be able to achieve internal growth  expand our operations or grow our business 
failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the diversion of management s attention from our existing business  the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves  and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets 
our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the united states and canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or tax laws 
an increase to our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability 
in addition  the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 

table of contents our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions

in addition  the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
a default under our credit agreement or the indenture governing the notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions

these laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth 
using cash for operational growth  capital expenditures  share repurchases  or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt 
also  if we seek to incur more debt  we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility 
if we pursue additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements

anti takeover provisions of florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control

for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine 
the issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock  including by the grant of voting control to others 
our by laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders

adverse changes in overall business and economic factors may impact our customers and increase potential credit risks 
these risks may be heightened as a result of economic uncertainty and market volatility 
in the past  some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties and likewise  some may experience financial difficulties in the future 
these difficulties expose us to increased risks related to the collectability of amounts due for services performed 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties which would materially impact the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings as of july

table of contents acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify  acquire  and successfully integrate companies 
on november   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of communication services  inc communication services  a provider of outside plant construction services to telecommunications companies in the southeastern and south central united states 
the anticipated benefits of this acquisition include incremental growth opportunities with existing customers and geographic expansion 
the purchase price for communication services was million paid from cash on hand and the assumption of approximately million in capital lease obligations 
approximately million of the purchase price has been placed in escrow until november  and will be used to satisfy indemnification obligations of the sellers that may arise 
on december   we acquired neocom solutions  inc neocom  based in woodstock  georgia 
neocom provides services to construct  install  optimize and maintain wireless communication facilities in the southeastern united states 
the anticipated benefits of this acquisition include incremental growth opportunities with new and existing customers  including wireless service providers 
the purchase price for neocom was million paid from cash on hand 
approximately million of the purchase price has been placed in escrow until june  and will be used to satisfy indemnification obligations of the seller that may arise 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable companies converge  growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services  and governmental broadband stimulus funding 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these factors drive customer demand for our services 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
several large telephone companies have pursued fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators 
these long term initiatives and the likelihood that other telephone companies pursue similar strategies present opportunities for us 
there are also significant opportunities to construct rural fiber networks throughout the country as a result of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
arra originally allocated billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without broadband infrastructure 
this funding included awards to many of our current and former customers 
these projects require engineering and construction resources and are expected to meaningfully increase industry activity over the next two years  which may further increase demand for the type of services we provide 
there is a significant increase in demand for mobile broadband driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices 
this demand and other advances in technology have created the need for wireless carriers to upgrade their networks and have increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers 
as the demand for mobile broadband grows  the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled over customers fiber and coaxial networks increases and  as a result  carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites 
these trends are increasing the demand for the types of services we provide 

table of contents additionally  we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
underground facility locating is required prior to underground excavation and is impacted by overall economic activity 
underground excavation is required for the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
as a result  the level of outsourcing of this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity influence the demand for underground facility locating services 
within the context of a slowly growing economy  we believe the latest industry developments and trends support our outlook for growth and an improved business environment 
we will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  purchase price allocations  the fair value of goodwill  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  income taxes  accrued insurance claims  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
these estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in changes to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 

table of contents accrued insurance claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined with the assistance of an actuary and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims 
as of july   the liability for accrued claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on payment patterns of similar prior claims  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid within the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the million decrease in accrued insurance claims at july  was primarily due to timing of claims payments and a reduction in loss exposures 
with regard to losses occurring in fiscal and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss of up to million on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
these annual retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in three states in which the company participates in a state sponsored insurance fund 
aggregate stop loss coverage for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for losses under our employee health plan occurring during fiscal and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss  on an annual basis  of  per participant 
goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
the increase in goodwill and intangibles is a result of the company s fiscal acquisitions of communication services and neocom 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
there was no goodwill impairment during fiscal communication services and neocom were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the purchase price of each company has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
the carrying value of goodwill increased by million and intangible assets increased by million as a result of these acquisitions 
management determined the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets based primarily on estimated discounted future cash flows and expected royalty rates for tradenames 
the purchase price paid for each of the acquired companies reflects expectations of anticipated future cash flows and exceeded the fair value of identifiable net assets 
as a result  goodwill was recognized in the amount of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
the full amount of goodwill related to the communication services and neocom acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
in accordance with asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 

table of contents we use judgment in assessing if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
to measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value potentially resulting in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units was based on projections of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually  which is greater than the risks inherent in the company as a whole 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis decreased compared to the rate used in our fiscal analysis as a result of reduced risk relative to industry conditions 
a basis point change in the discount rate would not have had a material impact on the results of the fiscal annual impairment analysis 
we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal impairment analysis are consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
the fiscal analysis used the same valuation techniques described for the fiscal annual analysis 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis decreased compared to the rate used in our fiscal interim analysis since economic conditions stabilized during reducing the risks inherent in the reporting units 
we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal impairment analysis were consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was significantly impacted by the extreme volatility in the us equity and credit markets and was below the book value of shareholders equity by a substantial margin 
as a result  we evaluated whether the decrease in our market capitalization reflected factors that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value 
based on a combination of factors  including the economic environment  the sustained period of decline in our market capitalization  and the implied valuation and discount rate assumptions in our industry  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to perform an interim impairment test of the reporting units and related intangible assets as of january  as a result of this impairment test  we recognized a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal second quarter charge included impairments at the following reporting units broadband installation services for million  c for million  ervin for million  nichols for million  stevens for million and utiliquest for million 
the interim impairment analysis was finalized during the third quarter of fiscal and no further charges were incurred 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no additional impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 

table of contents the fiscal analysis used the same valuation techniques described for the fiscal annual analysis 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis reflected challenging economic conditions and lower industry valuation comparisons 
we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal impairment analysis were consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
for fiscal  and none of the reporting units incurred operating losses which would impact our financial position in a material manner 
current operating results  including any losses  are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets at additional reporting units 
for example  a change in the estimated discount rate used would have impacted the amount of the goodwill impairment charges recorded during fiscal additionally  adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units 
we can provide no assurances that  if such conditions occur  they will not trigger additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as of july   we believe the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset is recoverable  however  there can be no assurances that they will not be impaired in future periods 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including tradenames and customer relationship intangibles 
as of july   management believes that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets may become impaired 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we grant stock options  time based and performance based restricted share units to certain employees and officers 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions  including risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility and dividends 
the fair value of restricted share units is estimated on the date of grant and is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant 
time vesting restricted share units vest ratably over a period of four years and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date 
performance vesting restricted share units vest over a three year period from the date of grant and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date  if certain performance goals are achieved 
in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation  compensation costs for performance based awards are recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine the probability of achieving the performance goals at each reporting period and recognize compensation costs based on our estimate of the shares that are expected to vest 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
asc topic  income taxes asc topic formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  recognition and classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under asc topic  company s may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation  or litigation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties which would materially impact our trade accounts receivable or allowance for doubtful accounts as of july  
table of contents contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
asc topic  contingencies asc topic requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with asc topic as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 
results of operations the company uses a fiscal year ending on the last saturday in july 
fiscal and each consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks  with its fourth quarter having weeks of operations 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenues earned  our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated totals may not add due to rounding fiscal year ended dollars in millions revenues expenses cost of earned revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization general and administrative depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment charge total interest income interest expense loss on debt extinguishment other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenues 
as a result of our fiscal year end date  fiscal has weeks compared to weeks in fiscal the following table presents information regarding total revenues by type of customer for the fiscal years ended july  and july   including the additional week of operations in fiscal totals may not add due to rounding fiscal year ended increase increase revenue of total revenue of total decrease decrease dollars in millions telecommunications underground facility locating electric and gas utilities and other customers total contract revenues revenues increased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal of this increase  million was generated by businesses acquired during fiscal 
table of contents revenues from specialty construction services provided to telecommunications companies increased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal of this increase  million was generated by businesses acquired during fiscal additionally  we experienced a million increase for a significant telephone customer deploying fiber within its network  a million increase from two leading cable multiple system operators for installation  maintenance and construction services  including services to provision fiber to cellular sites  and a million increase for another telephone customer increasing the capabilities of its networks 
other customers had net increases of million during fiscal including the work performed for rural broadband initiatives 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease from a leading cable multiple system operator for installation  maintenance and construction services 
we also experienced a million net decrease compared to the prior year for a significant telephone customer deploying fiber to its network  partially offset by work performed under new contracts with this customer 
total revenues from underground facility locating customers during fiscal decreased to million compared to million during fiscal the decrease resulted from contracts that were terminated since fiscal  reflecting a planned de emphasis of technician intensive customer contracts 
total revenues from electric and gas utilities and other construction and maintenance customers during fiscal increased to million compared to million during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increases in work performed for several gas companies and electric utilities during fiscal as compared to fiscal costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased to million during fiscal compared to million during  which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar 
included in costs of earned revenues for fiscal and fiscal are million and million  respectively  in charges recorded in connection with the settlement of legal matters 
excluding such charges  there was a million increase in costs of earned revenues 
the net increase was primarily due to higher level of operations during fiscal  including the operating costs of communication services and neocom since their acquisitions during the second quarter of fiscal the primary components of the increase were a million increase in direct materials costs  a million increase in other direct costs  and a million aggregate increase in direct labor and independent subcontractor costs 
costs of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenues decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the legal settlement charges referred to above  cost of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenues decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal labor and subcontractor costs represented a lower percentage of total revenue for fiscal and decreased compared to fiscal as a result of improved operating efficiency and the mix of work performed 
offsetting this decrease  direct materials costs increased as a percentage of total revenue as our mix of work included a higher level of projects where we provided materials to the customer 
additionally  fuel costs increased as a percentage of contract revenues as compared to the prior year 
other direct costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue year over year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million during fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar 
the decrease in total general and administrative expenses resulted from a reduction of payroll expense and reduced legal and professional fees related to certain information technology initiatives that were completed 
partially offsetting these decreases were incremental general and administrative expenses of communication services and neocom which were acquired during the second quarter of fiscal and increased incentive pay expenses as a result of improved operating results 
stock based compensation expense was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues reflects a reduction in payroll expense and legal and professional fees related to certain information technology initiatives that were completed in fiscal  partially offset by increased incentive pay due to improved operating results 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal and totaled and as a percentage of contract revenues during the current and prior year  respectively 
the decreases for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of assets becoming fully depreciated during  partially offset by increased replacement activity in the second half of fiscal these decreases were also offset by the addition of fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets related to the communication services and neocom acquisitions during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase reflects higher debt balances outstanding during fiscal however  the overall effective interest rate on these borrowings has been reduced as a result of the fiscal issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  as described below  and the related purchase and redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due loss on debt extinguishment 
on january   dycom investments  inc  one of our subsidiaries  issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes in a private placement 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to fund our purchase in january of million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes at a price of of the principal amount pursuant to a tender offer to purchase  for cash  any and all of the million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes  and to fund our redemption in february of the remaining million outstanding aggregate principal amount of notes at a price of of the principal amount 
as a result  during fiscal we recognized debt extinguishment costs of million comprised of tender premiums and legal and professional fees associated with the tender offer and subsequent redemption and million for the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
other income  net 
other income increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the fluctuations in other income were a function of the number of assets sold and prices obtained for those assets during the periods 
income taxes 
the following table presents our income tax expense and effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal years and fiscal year ended dollars in millions income tax provision effective income tax rate our effective income tax rates differ from the statutory rate for the tax jurisdictions where we operate as a result of several factors 
during fiscal and fiscal the provision for income taxes included the reversal of million and million  respectively  of certain income tax liabilities which were no longer required due to the expiration of statutes of limitation 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal we recognized a non cash income tax charge of million for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset associated with an investment that became impaired for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of these items  the variations in our effective income tax rate for fiscal and are primarily attributable to the impact of non deductible and non taxable items and tax credits recognized in relation to our pre tax results during the period 
as a percentage  these tax items will generally have a greater impact on the effective income tax rate in periods of lower pre tax results 
as of july   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  which would reduce our effective tax rate during the periods recognized if it is determined that those liabilities are not required 
net income 
net income was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenues 
as a result of our fiscal year end date  fiscal has weeks compared to weeks in fiscal the following table presents information regarding total revenues by type of customer for the fiscal years ended july  and july   including the additional week in fiscal totals may not add due to rounding fiscal year ended increase increase revenue of total revenue of total decrease decrease dollars in millions telecommunications underground facility locating electric and gas utilities and other customers total contract revenues revenues decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents specialty construction services provided to telecommunications companies were million during fiscal which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar  compared to million during fiscal  a decrease of 
during fiscal  we performed restoration services totaling million related to the hurricanes that impacted the southern united states in and related to the winter storms during the third fiscal quarter of there were minimal storm restoration services performed during fiscal we also experienced other decreases from significant customers as a result of their reductions in spending  including a million decrease for a customer engaged in a fiber deployment project  and a million net decrease for installation  maintenance and construction services provided to leading cable multiple system operators 
additionally  there was a million decrease in work performed for a significant telephone customer maintaining and upgrading their network during fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in services to a significant telephone customer that merged with another telephone customer in july and a million increase for a significant telephone customer upgrading and deploying fiber to their network 
other customers had net increases of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenues from underground facility locating customers were million during fiscal which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar  compared to million during fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease resulted from declines in customer demand levels as general economic weakness continued during fiscal resulting in a lower level of construction activity and from difficult weather conditions that impacted the third quarter of fiscal additionally  revenue during fiscal included million of restoration work related to the hurricanes that impacted the southern united states 
total revenues from electric and gas utilities and other construction and maintenance customers were million during fiscal which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar  compared to million during fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in construction work performed for gas customers  including gas pipeline projects for two customers that were completed during fiscal additionally  during fiscal we performed million of restoration work related to the hurricanes that impacted the southern united states compared to none during fiscal costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues were million during fiscal which included an additional week required by our fiscal calendar  compared to million during  a decrease of million 
included in costs of earned revenues for fiscal is a million charge in connection with the settlement of a legal matter 
excluding such charge  there was a net million decrease in costs of earned revenues 
this decline was composed of variances in direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together  and other direct costs which decreased million  and million  respectively  partially offset by a million increase in direct materials costs 
the decrease in total cost of earned revenues was primarily due to lower levels of operations during fiscal as compared to fiscal costs of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenues increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal due in part to the million charge related to the legal settlement referred to above  or of contract revenues 
excluding the legal settlement charge  costs of earned revenues as a percentage of contract revenues increased for fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  our mix of work included a higher level of projects where we provided materials to the customer 
as a result  direct materials costs increased as a percentage of total revenue 
in addition  labor and subcontractor costs represented a lower percentage of total revenue in fiscal and decreased compared to fiscal the overall decrease in labor and subcontractor costs as a percentage of revenue was net of the impact of reduced efficiency from lower operating levels in fiscal and generally higher training costs 
fuel costs increased as a percentage of contract revenues as compared to fiscal due to increases in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel during fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million during fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in total general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a reduction of incentive pay expense due to lower operating results and from a reduction in legal and professional fees 
the decrease was offset by the impact of weeks of results included in fiscal as compared to weeks in fiscal additionally  stock based compensation expense decreased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal from reduced performance based restricted stock expense as a result of not meeting fiscal performance criteria 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues reflects lower absorption of office and support costs and certain payroll costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to compared to from fiscal year the decrease in amount was primarily a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated and certain assets being sold during fiscal and fiscal amortization expense of intangible assets also decreased during fiscal as compared fiscal as certain assets became fully amortized 

table of contents goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal  there were no goodwill impairment charges 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million that included impairments at the following reporting units broadband installation services for million  c utility contractors for million  ervin cable construction for million  nichols communications for million  stevens communications for million and utiliquest for million 
this charge was the result of an interim test for impairment reflecting valuation assumptions as of the end of our second quarter of fiscal our interim analysis was finalized in the third quarter of fiscal and no further charges were incurred during fiscal interest expense  net 
interest income was less than million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the decrease is the result of lower interest yield earned on cash balances during the period 
interest expense was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease reflects reduced interest expense on our senior subordinated notes as a result of the buyback of million principal amount of the notes during fiscal and reduced balances for letters of credit 
additionally  we had no borrowings under our credit agreement during compared to million which was borrowed and repaid during the decrease was offset by the impact of weeks of results included in fiscal as compared to weeks in fiscal other income  net 
other income increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal during fiscal  other income included a gain of million on extinguishment of debt related to the buyback of million principal amount of notes during the second and third quarters of fiscal additionally  other income during fiscal includes a charge of million for the write off of deferred financing costs when we replaced the existing credit agreement during the first quarter of fiscal excluding these items  other income increased million as the result of a greater number of assets sold and improved pricing during fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes 
the following table presents our income tax expense and effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal years and fiscal year ended dollars in millions income tax provision benefit effective income tax rate our effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal differ from the statutory rate for the tax jurisdictions where we operate as a result of several factors 
specifically  during fiscal and fiscal  the provision for income taxes included the reversal of million and million  respectively  of certain income tax liabilities which were no longer required due to the expiration of statutes of limitation 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal we recognized a non cash income tax charge of million for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset associated with an investment that became impaired for tax purposes 
further  only a portion of the fiscal goodwill impairment charge was deductible for income tax purposes 
other variations in our tax rate are attributable to tax credits recognized and the impact of non deductible and non taxable items in relation to our pre tax results during the period 
as of july   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  which would reduce our effective tax rate during the periods recognized if it is determined that those liabilities are not required 
income loss from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations was million for fiscal as compared to a loss of million for fiscal net income loss 
net income was million for fiscal as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
historically  our sources of cash have been operating activities  long term debt  equity offerings  bank borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of idle and surplus equipment and real property 
our working capital needs vary based on our level of operations and generally increase with higher levels of revenues 
our working capital requirements are also impacted by the time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable for work performed for customers 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at july  compared to million at july  cash decreased for fiscal as a result of working capital changes consistent with the growth in our business  capital expenditures  cash paid for the acquisitions of communication services and neocom  and repurchases of our common stock  offset by the net proceeds from our debt refinancing described below and proceeds from the sale of assets 
working capital total current assets less total current liabilities was million at july  compared to million at july  capital resources are primarily used to purchase equipment and maintain sufficient levels of working capital in order to support our contractual commitments to customers 
we periodically borrow from and repay our revolving credit facility based on our cash requirements 
additionally  our capital requirements may increase to the extent we make acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  buy back our common stock or repurchase or call our senior subordinated notes 
we have not paid cash dividends since our board of directors regularly evaluates our dividend policy based on our financial condition  profitability  cash flow  capital requirements  and the outlook of our business 
we currently intend to retain any earnings for use in the business  including for investment in acquisitions  and consequently we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
additionally  the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contains covenants that restrict our ability to make certain payments  including the payment of dividends 
we believe that none of our major customers were experiencing financial difficulties which would materially affect our cash flows or liquidity as of july  we expect capital expenditures  net of disposals  to range from million to million for fiscal our level of capital expenditures can vary depending on the customer demand for our services  the replacement cycle we select for our equipment  and overall economic growth 
we intend to fund these expenditures primarily from operating cash flows  availability under our credit facility and cash on hand 
fiscal year ended dollars in millions net cash flows provided by operating activities used in investing activities used in financing activities cash from operating activities 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
operating cash flow and net income for fiscal were reduced by our payment of million in consent and other fees related to our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
non cash items during fiscal were primarily depreciation and amortization  gain on sale of assets  stock based compensation  deferred income taxes  amortization of debt issuance costs  and the write off of approximately million of debt issuance costs in connection with the tender offer and subsequent redemption of the outstanding notes 
changes in working capital excluding cash and changes in other long term assets and liabilities used million of operating cash flow during fiscal the primary working capital uses during fiscal were increases in accounts receivable of million and increases in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million 
the increases in accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings is a result of higher revenue levels during the fourth quarter  including storm restoration services

our consolidated balance sheet as of july  includes a long term liability of approximately million for accrued insurance claims

see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accrued insurance claims liability 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at july  was million and is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet

sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations 
these obligations include interest payments required on our senior subordinated notes and borrowings  working capital requirements  and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  or to the extent we buy back our common stock or repurchase or call our senior subordinated notes  our capital requirements may increase 
changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets  in which case we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the credit agreement to provide short term funding 

table of contents although the distress in the financial markets has not significantly impacted our financial position as of july   management continues to monitor the financial markets and assess general economic conditions 
if further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely impact our ability to access capital markets  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the existing committed credit facility to provide short term funding 
we believe that our cash investment policies are conservative and we expect that the current volatility in the capital markets will not have a material impact on our cash investments 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate  particularly in light of the current economic conditions and the uncertainty those conditions may create regarding our customer s requirements for our services 
our backlog totaled billion and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including our fiscal year which ends on the last saturday in july  and as a result  fiscal consisted of weeks with the fourth quarter having weeks of operations  as compared to other fiscal years  such as fiscal  consisting of weeks with the fourth quarter having weeks  the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  including possible delays as a result of material procurement  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers and the timing of their budget approvals  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuations in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on payroll withholdings obligations  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions  fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of performance criteria in performance based share awards  as well as the timing and vesting period of all stock based awards  
table of contents fluctuations in incentive pay as a result of operating results  fluctuations in interest expense due to levels of debt and related borrowing costs  fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in income tax expense due to levels of taxable earnings and the impact of non deductible items and tax credits 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
we monitor the effects of market changes on interest rates and manage interest rate risks by investing in short term cash equivalents with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to annual earnings of approximately million if our cash and equivalents held as of july  were to be fully invested in interest bearing financial instruments 
our revolving credit facility permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of july  outstanding long term debt at july  included million of our senior subordinated notes due in  which bear a fixed rate of interest of 
due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the outstanding notes totaled approximately million as of july   based on quoted market prices 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
