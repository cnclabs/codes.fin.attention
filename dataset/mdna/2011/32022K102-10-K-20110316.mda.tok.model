overview first savings bank is a community based savings bank primarily serving king and to a lesser extent  pierce  snohomish and kitsap counties  washington through our full service banking office located in renton  washington 
we are in the business of attracting deposits from the public through our office and utilizing those deposits to originate loans 
our current business strategy emphasizes one to four family residential  multifamily and commercial real estate lending 
until recently  construction land development lending was a significant part of our business strategy 
we have deemphasized this type of lending over the past three years as a result of market conditions resulting in a decline in these types of loans to of our loan portfolio at december  first savings b ank s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate one to four family  multifamily  commercial real estate  business  consumer and to a lesser extent construction land development loans 
continuing adverse conditions in the national and local economies have resulted in a challenging operating environment for financial institutions  particularly in the pacific northwest 
over the last three years  the national residential lending market has experienced severe conditions as loan delinquencies and foreclosure rates rose to unprecedented volumes 
during  the residential lending market improved somewhat especially late in the year  but remained at depressed levels 
nationally at year end  the delinquency rate for one to four family residential loans days or more delinquent was and the percentage of loans in foreclosure was according to the national delinquency survey published by the mortgage bankers association 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income 
since first savings bank is liability sensitive  meaning its liabilities reprice at a faster rate than its interest earning assets  the lower interest rate environment that we are currently experiencing has contributed to an improvement in our net interest rate spread 
during our provision for loan losses totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision was attributable to the level of nonperforming loans  the continued depressed real estate values  the uncertain economic environment in our market area  the fdic liquidations of financial institutions in the pacific northwest and the effect it has had on our market area  the level of charge offs during and the increase in the number of requests for loan modifications 
we will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our allowance for loan losses as we deem necessary

our noninterest expenses decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to a one time goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in with no comparable charge taken in  offset primarily by an million increase in oreo related expenses during the year ended december  business strategy our long term business strategy is to operate and grow first savings bank as a well capitalized and profitable community bank  offering one to four family residential  commercial and multifamily real estate  consumer  business and to a lesser extent construction land development loans along with a diversified array of deposits and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the alll must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the alll consists of two components general and specific allowances 
the general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans 
management considers factors such as charge off history  the prevailing economy  borrower s ability to repay  the regulatory environment  competition  geographic and loan type concentrations  policy and underwriting standards  nature and volume of the l oan portfolio  management s experience level  our loan review and grading systems  the value of underlying collateral  the level of problem loans  in assessing the alll 
the specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectibility of a specific loan  has been impaired and a loss is probable 
the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any and costs to sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
our board of directors approves the provision for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the alll is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional information see the section titled our provision for loan losses has increased substantially and we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations  within the section titled item a 
risk factors in this form k 
valuation of oreo and foreclosed assets 
real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors  including third party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale 
accordingly  the valuation of oreo is subject to significant external and internal judgment 
any differences between management s assessment of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and the carrying value of the loan at the date a particular property is transferred into oreo are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically reviews oreo values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
any further decreases in the value of oreo are considered valuation adjustments and trigger a corresponding charge to noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
expenses from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of oreo are included in noninterest expense 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a expenses  such as our charitable contribution to the first financial northwest foundation  that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c writedowns in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards 
the level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile 
at each balance sheet date  existing assessments are reviewed and  if necessary  revised to reflect changed circumstances 
in a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred  the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity
