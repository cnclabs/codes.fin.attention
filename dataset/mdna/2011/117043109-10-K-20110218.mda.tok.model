overview and outlook general in  brunswick continued to operate in a difficult economy and marine industry  while positioning itself to take advantage of market opportunities as they evolve  and maintaining its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling and billiards industries  by generating positive free cash flow  demonstrating outstanding operating leverage  and performing better than the markets in which it competes 
actions taken in support of the company s strategic objectives in included generating positive free cash flow ended the year with million of cash and marketable securities  compared with million at the end of  cash flows from operations totaled million during  supported by improved operating results and a federal tax refund of million received during  and selectively increased capital expenditures for profit maintaining investments 
demonstrating outstanding operating leverage reported operating earnings of million in compared with operating losses of million in on a sales increase of percent  the company experienced operating leverage  defined as the change in operating earnings loss divided by the change in net sales  of percent  a significant component of the company s cost reduction efforts has been a focus on reducing its manufacturing footprint by consolidating boat and engine production into fewer plants 
since january   the company has closed of its boat manufacturing facilities and has announced plans to consolidate engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its stillwater  oklahoma plant to its fond du lac  wisconsin plant  reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by percent  and reported restructuring  exit and impairment charges and trade name impairment charges of million in  down by million when compared with performing better than the markets in which it competes sales improved million or percent during our marine engine  boat and fitness segments reported sales increases of percent  percent and percent  respectively  and the company was able to increase sales at its marine segments by percent 
this was largely due to increased wholesale shipments to boat builders and boat engine dealers as a result of inventory reduction actions taken in in  the company has achieved its objective to more closely align the company s wholesale shipments with domestic retail demand 
brunswick incurred financial losses in due to continued weakness in marine retail markets 
while the overall industry declined during compared with the already low retail unit sales levels of  some boat categories  such as aluminum fishing and pontoons  began to show signs of stability 
net sales in increased to  million from  million in the overall increase in sales was mainly due to the absence of the marine pipeline inventory reduction that occurred in in  the company significantly reduced wholesale shipments to boat builders and dealers to levels below retail sales levels in order to reduce overall pipeline inventory 
as a result  net sales in have increased significantly as wholesale boat unit shipments in more closely matched boat retail sales levels  wholesale boat unit shipments were significantly lower than retail boat unit sales 
the company expects the significant decline in marine retail demand experienced over the past several years will level out in additionally  the company anticipates that the marine retail market for smaller boat categories will outperform larger boats 
the company also realized an increase in net sales as a result of lower discounts required to facilitate boat sales during when compared with in  the company reported higher sales across its marine engine  boat and fitness segments  while experiencing a single digit decline in its bowling billiards segment 
international markets remained strong for the company in  as each segment reported increased international sales 
operating earnings during were million  with operating margins of percent 
operating losses in were million  with negative operating margins of percent 
the results included million of restructuring  exit and impairment charges and trade name impairment charges  while the results included million of restructuring  exit and impairment charges 
improved operating earnings during mainly resulted from higher overall engine and boat wholesale unit sales and lower discounts provided to facilitate retail boat sales  as discussed above  and improved fixed cost absorption from increased production levels 
additionally  operating earnings in benefited from lower restructuring  exit and impairment charges  reduced pension and bad debt expense and savings related to the consolidation of the company s marine manufacturing footprint into fewer facilities  as well as cost reductions from other successful initiatives 
restructuring activities in november  brunswick announced restructuring initiatives to improve the company s cost structure  better utilize overall capacity and improve general operating efficiencies 
these initiatives reflected the company s response to a difficult marine market 
as the marine market continued to decline  brunswick expanded its restructuring activities during   and in order to improve performance  better position the company to address current market conditions  and achieve longer term profit growth 
these initiatives have resulted in the recognition of restructuring  exit and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations during  and total restructuring  exit and impairment charges recorded during  and for each of the company s reportable segments are summarized below in millions marine engine boat fitness bowling billiards corporate total see note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the company anticipates it will incur approximately million of additional charges in related to known restructuring activities initiated in or goodwill and trade name impairments brunswick assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company did not record any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairments during after completing its annual impairment test 
the company may be required to take impairment charges in a future period if it experiences any significant adverse changes in its businesses 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill at the company s fitness and marine engine segments was million and million  respectively 
based on current business projections  the company does not believe it will incur an impairment loss on its fitness or marine engine segments in future periods 
see note significant accounting policies for further discussion surrounding the company s methods and key assumptions used in its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
during the third quarter of  brunswick encountered a significant adverse change in the business climate 
a weak us economy  soft housing markets and the contraction of liquidity in global credit markets contributed to the continued reduction in demand for certain brunswick products and  consequently  reduced wholesale shipments and production rates for those affected products 
as a result of this reduced demand  along with lower than projected profits across certain brunswick brands and lower commitments received from its dealer network in the third quarter  management revised its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of  which lowered the estimated fair value of certain businesses 
as a result of the lower fair value estimates  brunswick concluded that the carrying amounts of its boat segment and bowling retail and billiards reporting units within the bowling billiards segment exceeded their respective fair values 
the company compared the implied fair value of the goodwill in each reporting unit with the carrying value and concluded that a million pretax impairment charge needed to be recognized in the third quarter of of this amount  million related to the boat segment reporting unit  million related to the bowling retail reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
as a result of the million of impairments  all goodwill at these respective reporting units has been written down to zero 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment testing  the company analyzed the valuation of its other indefinite lived intangibles  consisting of acquired trade names 
brunswick estimated the fair value of trade names by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief from royalty approach 
this approach treats the trade name as if it were licensed by the company rather than owned  and calculates its value based on the discounted cash flow of the projected license payments 
the analysis resulted in a pretax trade name impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  representing the excess of the carrying cost of the trade names over the calculated fair value 
of this amount  million related to the boat segment reporting unit  million related to the marine engine segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized trade name impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
outlook for looking ahead to  the company expects that revenues will achieve modest growth when compared with the company expects the significant decline in marine retail demand over the past several years will level out during additionally  the company anticipates that the marine retail market for smaller boat categories will outperform larger boats 
the company expects to continue matching its marine production and wholesale shipments to marine retail sales in as a result  revenue growth in the marine engine and boat segments will be largely dependent on marine retail demand  supplemented by the company focus on organic growth in its marine operations 
the company also expects the fitness and bowling billiards segments to experience a modest growth in revenues during when compared with the company expects to have positive earnings per share in resulting from increased revenues and the expected strong operating earnings leverage resulting from its transformed manufacturing footprint and cost structure 
the company is also expecting net earnings in to benefit from previously announced marine plant consolidation activities  and lower restructuring  exit and impairment charges  net interest  depreciation and pension expenses 
a modest increase in the company s tax provision is expected to negatively impact net earnings in matters affecting comparability the following events have occurred during  and  which the company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations goodwill impairment charges 
in  the company incurred million of goodwill impairment charges 
this was a result of the continued reduction in demand for certain products  along with lower than projected profits across certain brands  which led management to revise its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of the revised future cash flow expectations resulted in the company lowering its estimate of the fair value of certain businesses and required the company to take a million pretax goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of additionally  the company recorded impairments in the second quarter of related to the analyses performed on its baja boat business and its valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business

as a result  the company s net debt was reduced million in to million from million in brunswick s debt to capitalization ratio increased to percent as of december   from percent as of december   mainly related to the effect of losses on shareholders equity  partially offset by lower debt levels 
in may  the company entered into the mercury receivables abl facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation gecdf to replace the mercury marine accounts receivable sale program the company had with brunswick acceptance company  llc bac as described in note financial services 
the mercury receivables abl facility agreement provides for a base level of borrowings of million that are secured by the domestic accounts receivable of mercury marine  a division of the company  at a borrowing rate  set at the beginning of each month  equal to the one month libor rate plus percent  provided  however  that the one month libor rate shall not be less than percent 
borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility can be adjusted to million to accommodate seasonal increases in accounts receivable from may to august 
borrowing availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of mercury marine domestic accounts receivable  adjusted for eligibility requirements  with an percent advance rate 
the company was also able to borrow an additional million in excess of the borrowing base according to the over advance feature through november  which declined ratably each month through november borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility are further limited to the lesser of the total amount available under the mercury receivables abl facility or the mercury marine receivables  excluding certain amounts  pledged as collateral against the mercury receivables abl facility 
the mercury receivables abl facility also includes a financial covenant  which corresponds to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant included in the company s revolving credit facility and the bac joint venture agreement described in note financial services 
the mercury receivables abl facility s term will expire concurrently with the termination of bac  by the company with days notice or by gecdf upon the company s default under the mercury receivables abl facility  including failure to comply with the facility s financial covenant 
initial borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility were million 
at december  and december  the company had no borrowings under this facility 
the amount of borrowing capacity available under this facility at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the company has a million secured  asset based revolving credit facility revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks through may  as described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the company pays a facility fee of to basis points per annum  which is based on the daily average utilization of the revolving credit facility 
the company may borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility equal to the value of the borrowing base  which consists of certain accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment of certain of its domestic subsidiaries 
the borrowing base had a value of million  excluding cash  as of december  the company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  letters of credit outstanding under the facility totaled million as of december   resulting in unused borrowing capacity of million 
the company s borrowing capacity may also be affected by the fixed charge coverage covenant included in the facility 
the covenant requires that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio  as defined in the agreement  of greater than times  whenever the unused borrowing capacity falls below million 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  the company had a fixed charge ratio in excess of times  and therefore had full access to borrowing capacity available under the facility 
when the fixed charge ratio is below times  the company is required to maintain at least million of unused borrowing capacity in order to be in compliance with the covenant 
consequently  the borrowing capacity is effectively reduced by million whenever the fixed charge ratio falls below times 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company had a fixed charge ratio below times  but was in compliance with the covenant as unused borrowing capacity exceeded million 
the company expects to be in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during management believes that the company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the company s short term and long term needs 
the company has continued to reduce its near term debt obligations  its notes  which totaled million at december   represent the only significant long term debt maturity until management expects that the company s near term operating cash requirements will be met out of existing cash and marketable securities balances and free cash flow 
specifically  the company expects to achieve net earnings in when compared with net losses in and as a result of increasing sales

financial services the company  through its brunswick financial services corporation bfs subsidiary  owns a percent interest in a joint venture  brunswick acceptance company  llc bac 
cdf ventures  llc cdfv  a subsidiary of ge capital corporation gecc  owns the remaining percent 
bac commenced operations in and provides secured wholesale inventory floor plan financing to brunswick s boat and engine dealers 
bac also purchased and serviced a portion of mercury marine s domestic accounts receivable relating to its boat builder and dealer customers 
this program was terminated and replaced in may with a new facility discussed below and in note debt 
the term of the joint venture extends through june  the joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the joint venture or purchase of the other party s interest at the end of this term 
alternatively  either partner may allow the agreement to terminate at the end of its term 
concurrent with finalizing the amended and restated asset based revolving credit facility revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter of  the company and cdfv amended the joint venture agreement to conform the financial covenant contained in that agreement to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test contained in the revolving credit facility 
compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test under the joint venture agreement is only required when the company s available  unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is below million 
in  the company was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test under the joint venture agreement 
as available unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was above million at the end of  the company was not required to meet the minimum fixed charge test 
bac is funded in part through a billion secured borrowing facility from ge commercial distribution finance corporation gecdf  which is in place through the term of the joint venture  and with equity contributions from both partners 
bac also sells a portion of its receivables to a securitization facility  the ge dealer floorplan master note trust  which is arranged by gecc 
the sales of these receivables meet the requirements of a true sale and are therefore not retained on the financial statements of bac 
the indebtedness of bac is not guaranteed by the company or any of its subsidiaries 
in addition  bac is not responsible for any continuing servicing costs or obligations with respect to the securitized receivables 
bfs and gecdf have an income sharing arrangement related to income generated from the receivables sold by bac to the securitization facility 
the company records this income in other expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company considers bfs s investment in bac as an investment in a variable interest entity of which the company is not the primary beneficiary 
to qualify as the primary beneficiary  the company must have the power to direct the activities of bac that most significantly impact bac s economic performance and the company must have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from bac that could potentially be significant to bac 
based on a qualitative analysis performed by the company  bfs did not meet the definition of a primary beneficiary 
as a result  bfs s investment in bac is accounted for by the company under the equity method and is recorded as a component of investments in its condensed consolidated balance sheets 
the company records bfs s share of income or loss in bac based on its ownership percentage in the joint venture in equity earnings loss in its consolidated statements of operations 
bfs s equity investment is adjusted monthly to maintain a percent interest in accordance with the capital provisions of the joint venture agreement 
the company funds its investment in bac through cash contributions and reinvested earnings 
bfs s total investment in bac at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the reduction in bfs s total investment in bac is the result of an amendment to the joint venture agreement during the fourth quarter of  which reduced the company s minimum investment level from million to million 
bfs recorded income related to the operations of bac of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts include amounts earned by bfs under the aforementioned income sharing agreement  but exclude the discount expense paid by the company in on the sale of mercury marine s accounts receivable to the joint venture noted below 
in may  the company entered into an asset based lending facility mercury receivables abl facility with gecdf to replace the mercury marine accounts receivable sale program the company had with bac 
as such  there was no outstanding balance of receivables sold to bac as of december  or  respectively 
therefore  there were no accounts receivable sold to bac in  however  accounts receivable totaling million and million were sold to bac in and  respectively 
discounts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  have been recorded as an expense in other expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  bac reimbursed mercury marine million and million in and  respectively  for the related credit  collection and administrative costs incurred in connection with the servicing of such receivables 
concurrent with entering into the mercury receivables abl facility  the company repurchased million of accounts receivable from bac in may see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details on the company s mercury receivables abl facility

represents the expected cash obligations related to the company s liability for uncertain income tax positions 
as of december   the company s total liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  other than the items included in the table above  the company was unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
other long term liabilities include amounts reflected on the balance sheet  which primarily include certain agreements that provide for the assignment of lease and other long term receivables originated by the company to third parties and are treated as a secured obligation 
amounts above also include obligations under deferred revenue arrangements and future projected payments related to the company s nonqualified pension plans 
other long term liabilities also include million of required qualified pension plan contributions to be paid in  as well as million of scheduled retiree health care and life insurance benefit plan payments 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans  the company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid 
legal proceedings see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to certain legal and environmental proceedings 
environmental regulations in its marine engine segment  brunswick will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california adopted regulations that required catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment systems on sterndrive and inboard engines that became effective on january  the epa adopted similar environmental regulations governing engine sales  effective january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for those regions 
the company complies with current regulations and expects to comply fully with new regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products for the company and the industry 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
brunswick s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  marine parts and accessories  fitness equipment  bowling products  bowling retail activities and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities  rebates and manufacturer coupons that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of when the program has been communicated to the customer or at the time of sale 
revenues from freight are included as a part of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations  whereas shipping  freight and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivable for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
restructuring and exit activities 
from time to time  the company engages in actions associated with cost reduction initiatives 
the company s restructuring actions require significant estimates including a expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  b remaining lease obligations  including sublease income  and c other exit costs 
the company has accrued amounts that it believes are its best estimates of the obligations it expects to incur in connection with these actions  but these estimates are subject to change due to market conditions and final negotiations 
should the actual amounts differ from the originally estimated amounts  the company s earnings could decrease 
the company recognized million  million and million in restructuring  exit and impairment charges in  and  respectively  which are discussed in more detail in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets primarily result from business acquisitions 
the excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the company reviews these assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the company considers the marine engine segment  boat segment  fitness segment  bowling products business  bowling retail business and billiards business within the bowling billiards segment to be reporting units for goodwill testing 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and the guideline public company method 
the income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing a gordon growth model 
internally forecasted future cash flows  which the company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions  are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate developed for each reporting unit 
the discount rate is developed using market observable inputs  as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit s forecasted performance 
fair value under the guideline public company method is determined by applying market multiples for that reporting unit s comparable public companies to the unit s financial results 
the key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in a reporting unit s forecasted future performance  including revenue growth and operating margins  as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts  and selecting representative market multiples 
the company s primary intangible assets are customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations 
the costs of amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives  typically between three and fifteen years  to their estimated residual values using the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long lived assets described below 
intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of trade names is measured using a relief from royalty approach  which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company 
higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability  while other brands receive lower royalty rates 
the basis for future cash flow projections are internal revenue forecasts by brand  which the company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions  to which the selected royalty rate is applied 
these future cash flows are discounted using the applicable discount rate  which considers the annual goodwill impairment testing process noted above  as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset 
the key uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts  as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in developing the discount rate 
long lived assets 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  and other long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
once an impairment indicator is identified  the company tests for recoverability of the related asset group using an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining asset group s life 
in the event that an asset group s carrying value is not recoverable  the company records an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the long lived asset group s fair value 
fair value is determined using observable inputs  including the use of appraisals from independent third parties  when available  and  when observable inputs were not available  based on the company s assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
specifically  the company used discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset when observable inputs were unavailable 
the company tested its long lived asset balances for impairment as indicators presented themselves during  and  resulting in impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  which are recognized in restructuring  exit and impairment charges and selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
postretirement benefit reserves 
postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets and  as necessary  records valuation allowances against them

the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the company s tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange rate exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound  hungarian forint and new zealand dollar

for options and instruments with nonlinear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company would incur on its derivative financial instruments from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency rates  and commodity prices
