we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multi nationals  selected regional accounts and target market customers 
large multi nationals and selected regional accounts  which are significant in specific markets  are our core original equipment manufacturer customers 
the target market customers in the communications  power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development 
generally  our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 
distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenues in  of our revenues in and of our revenues in our distributors  which include arrow  avnet  ebv elektronik  future  and world peace  resell to mid sized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies 
sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow moving products 
under certain agreements  distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book 
in addition  agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
however  since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product  due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 
electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately of our revenues in  of our revenues in and of our revenues in our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics  jabil and celestica 
these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers 
originally  these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards  but they now typically provide design  supply management and manufacturing solutions as well 
many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies 
we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace

table of contents we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan  china 
this facility is owned by a joint venture company  leshan phoenix semiconductor company limited leshan  of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests 
our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements 
our joint venture partner  leshan radio company ltd  is formerly a state owned enterprise 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture 
each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder  provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment 
we committed to purchase of leshan s production capacity in  in and in and are currently committed to purchase approximately of leshan s expected production capacity in in  we incurred no underutilization charges 
in  we incurred million in underutilization charges 
in  we incurred million in underutilization charges 
as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan  we supply die used in the production process 
the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations 
in june  we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to million in semiconductor operations  which is in addition to the million originally approved 
in  we committed to make capital contributions of approximately million to this joint venture by  subject to market conditions 
as of december  we had made capital contributions of approximately million to this joint venture 
we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods 
our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts 
in some cases  longer term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship 
these contract manufacturers  including unisem  ase  kec  magnachip  phenitec  amkor and psi  accounted for approximately  and of our manufacturing costs in  and  respectively 
with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  we have gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines  china  thailand and vietnam 
we expect to consolidate sanyo semiconductor s japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites  resulting in a footprint of roughly million square feet in fabrication space and approximately million in assembly and test space 
outside of japan we currently own or lease through sanyo semiconductor and its subsidiaries approximately million square feet of production space 
much of the reductions in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities 
we expect to continue the existing sanyo semiconductor plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in their taiwan and hong kong manufacturing locations 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use many raw materials  including silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a just in time basis  and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments  contingencies and indemnities in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry

additionally  motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization  which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program 
through these arrangements  we have the right to use a significant amount of motorola owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 
in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  we obtained approximately  us patents   japanese patents and  other foreign patents granted  with approximately us pending patents   japanese pending patents and  other foreign pending patents  for a total of  granted and pending patents acquired 
these patents have expiration dates ranging from to sanyo electric has provided us with an indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown  intellectual property infringement issues  as well as certain known intellectual property infringement claims by third parties 
we have the legal right  for a limited period of time  to continue the use of the sanyo semiconductor name 

table of contents seasonality our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets 
traditionally  the seasonal trend consisted of a soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year for consumer products 
over the years  our products have increasingly become more consumer driven 
in  and  this seasonal trend for consumer products was less of a driver due to the global recession  which affected demand significantly in it is unclear if and when the past pattern will return now that global economic conditions are less volatile  or whether our industry will see more traditional and predictable trends and patterns 
backlog our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are predominately booked as far as weeks in advance of delivery 
generally  prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking 
backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers  in each case scheduled to be shipped over the week period following such date 
backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
because we record revenues on a sell through basis  backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered 
during  our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between and of actual revenues during such quarter 
as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases  customers tend to order products further in advance and  as a result  backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 
in the semiconductor industry  backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or  as a matter of industry practice  are often not enforced 
therefore  a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable 
for these reasons  the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 
we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just in time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products 
however  these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 
competition the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for general purpose semiconductor products like ours  is highly competitive 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies  as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
see part i  item a risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business located elsewhere in this report 
below we discuss the effects of competition on our four primary operating segments automotive and power group the principal methods of competition in the automotive and power group are new product innovation  technical performance  quality  service and price 
our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design capability  breadth of product portfolio  industry recognition as a reliable supplier  and our 
table of contents existing market share in the automotive and power market segment 
our significant competitors in this market segment include elmos semiconductor  fairchild semiconductor international inc  freescale semiconductor inc  infineon technologies ag  national semiconductor corporation  stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 
when compared to us  several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and engineering resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
one specific competitive challenge this group faces is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs 
with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in january  we expect this weakness to be mitigated 
if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase  in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 
computing and consumer products group the principal methods of competition in the computing and consumer products group are technical performance  total solution cost of ownership  quality and assurance of supply 
our architectures for ac dc conversion offer a competitive total cost of ownership and power efficient performance position to compete 
our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete in the computing and consumer game console market 
in addition  the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions such as dc dc converters  over voltage protection ic s  video and audio ics  and standard analog and logic ic s give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily 
our significant competitors in this market include intersil corporation  maxim integrated products  inc  texas instruments incorporated  stmicroelectronics nv and power integrations  inc when compared to us  several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
digital and mixed signal product group the principal methods of competition in the digital and mixed signal product group  are with other customer specific semiconductor vendors based on design experience  manufacturing capability  depth and quality of intellectual property  ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product  length of design cycle  longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 
our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables  both inside and outside of our control 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies  product performance and quality  manufacturing yields and availability  customer service  pricing  industry trends and general economic trends 
our medical and custom industrial businesses face direct competition from large diversified semiconductor suppliers that supply custom and semi custom ics  such as stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 
the business also faces direct competition from smaller end market focused mixed signal suppliers  such as elmos semiconductor and zmd ag 
direct competition also comes from our target customers themselves  who may have internal ic design resources dedicated to supporting the parent

research and development company sponsored research and development costs in  and were million of revenue  million of revenue and million of revenue  respectively 
our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
during  research and development costs increased due to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the newly acquired sdt  pulsecore and cmd businesses  increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in based upon local requirements  and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals 
government regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances  the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites  and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 
our manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona is located on property that is a superfund site  a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to clean up activities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the 
table of contents state of arizona 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 
the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease 
our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by government owned entities 
the remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on site and off site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded 
the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries  subject to specified limitations  for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination 
based upon the information available  we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 
our design center in east greenwich  rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination 
when we purchased the east greenwich facility  we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island 
this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property 
based on the information available  we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 
as a result of the acquisition of amis  we are a primary responsible party to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis s former corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
costs incurred by amis include implementation of the clean up plan  operations and maintenance of remediation systems  and other project management costs 
however  amis s former parent company  a subsidiary of nippon mining  contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asset retirement and environmental obligations  we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  a receivable from nippon mining s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  related to this matter 
we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and liability for currently known environmental conditions  to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
it is possible  however  that future developments  including changes in laws and regulations  government policies  customer specification  personnel and physical property conditions  including currently undiscovered contamination  could lead to material costs 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees of which  employees are in the united states 
none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are represented by workers councils 
of the total number of our employees as of december   approximately  were engaged in manufacturing and information services  approximately were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service  approximately were engaged in administration and approximately  were engaged in research and development 
with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  our employee base will increase by approximately  full time employees 
another approximately  people employed by sanyo electric are seconded to sanyo semiconductor for varying periods of time to allow for the orderly consolidation or transition of the current sanyo semiconductor activities

risk factors overview this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements  as that term is defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated in this form k could be deemed forward looking statements  particularly statements about our plans  strategies and prospects under the headings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
forward looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as believes  estimates  expects  projects  may  will  intends  plans  or anticipates  or by discussions of strategy  plans or intentions 
all forward looking statements in this form k are made based on our current expectations and estimates  and involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
among these factors are  as discussed more below  our revenues and operating performance  poor economic conditions and markets including the current credit and financial conditions  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in demand for our products  changes in inventories at our customers and distributors  technological and product development risks  availability of raw materials  competitors actions  pricing and gross profit pressures  loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  changes in manufacturing yields  control of costs and expenses  significant litigation  risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions including the recently 
table of contents completed sanyo transaction defined below  risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements from time to time  risks associated with our international operations  the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally  risks and costs associated with regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation 
additional factors that could affect our future results or events are described from time to time in our sec reports 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
you should carefully consider the trends  risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form k and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the sec before making any investment decision with respect to our securities 
if any of the following trends  risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  the trading prices of our securities could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business from time to time  we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 
at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses 
although  we have recently experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years  reduced end user demand  price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business 
in order to remain profitable  we must continue to successfully implement our business plan and examine and implement potentially advantageous cost reduction initiatives 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and  as a result  is subject to significant downturns and upturns 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
on the other hand  significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner 
in some ways  we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience these in the future 
we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be 
these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic conditions  including those related to the credit markets  may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time 
the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
reduced spending has in the past and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing  which results in a negative impact on gross profit 
volatility in global economic 
table of contents conditions may adversely and materially affect our industry  business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be 
in addition  to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected  then our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected 
moreover  volatility in revenues as a result of a unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 
furthermore  the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil 
if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all and we may not be able to refinance  if necessary  any outstanding debt when due  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future  if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate  or if interest rates increase significantly  we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  unanticipated global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of  other ways  including causing our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases  our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us  our key suppliers to become capacity constrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and our key suppliers to require acceleration  or our customers to extend  additional credit commitments 
any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties  including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses  incurring additional debt  assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities  we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions  mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions  including but not limited to  the difficulty of integrating  aligning and coordinating organizations  which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures  risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience  risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies  such as sanyo semiconductor  particularly if such company is lacking adequate financial reporting and internal control systems or possess systems that are materially different from ours  the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business  or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships  challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses  and negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs associated with the target 
in addition  current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us  and as a result  we could lose key employees 
these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel 
in connection with a transaction  key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of change in control agreements  acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on 
table of contents other equity based compensation rights 
further  as a result of current acquisitions  such as in the sanyo transaction defined below  or future acquisitions  we may assume liabilities from the target s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 
in connection with our acquisition activity  we are required by sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our financial statements 
the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements  or if they do have independent audited financial statements  such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems  which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financials 
in addition  immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements  we are dependent upon the acquired business financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information  including projections and goals for such acquired business 
we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business  or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner 
failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings  which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 
the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management 
in particular  in connection with the company s recent acquisition of sanyo semiconductor and other assets related to sanyo electric s semiconductor business the sanyo transaction  the integration of sanyo semiconductor has and will continue to require significant internal and external coordination 
the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development  marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships 
moreover  even if we were able to fully integrate sanyo semiconductor s business operations and other assets successfully  there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  cost savings  innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 
delays in integrating sanyo semiconductor  which could be caused by factors outside of our control  could adversely affect the intended benefits of our business  financial results  financial condition and stock price 
in connection with an acquisition  it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure 
as with any estimate  it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 
we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment on an annual basis see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note significant accounting policies goodwill of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form k for additional information about goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to our acquisition of pulsecore 
in the past  we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our acquisitions of amis  cherry semiconductor corporation cherry and the ptc business 
as of december   the total remaining goodwill for the company amounted to million 
factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and or increased costs  we may have further material goodwill impairments 

table of contents in addition  we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 
for example  in the sanyo transaction a portion of the purchase price is financed by a seven year loan with an adjustable interest rate from sanyo electric to sci llc 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default as well as representations  warranties  and covenants but does not contain any financial or negative covenants 
it is possible that factors outside of our control  including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers  could adversely affect the intended benefits from the sanyo transaction but we will continue to have a repayment obligation under the loan agreement 
our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing 
for instance  if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 
in addition  increased competition and other factors beyond our control  including economic factors  may lead to price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
moreover  we believe that we will need to improve the historic margin levels of the business and assets we acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction 
while we anticipate that this acquired business will benefit from expected synergies with our business and planned restructuring  which could improve its historic margin levels  we may not be able to successfully integrate this business within our estimated timeframes or at all to allow it to benefit from expected synergies and planned restructuring or we may have generally overestimated the anticipated benefits of expected synergies and planned restructuring 
furthermore  sanyo electric has agreed to provide certain operational support to sanyo semiconductor for a period of time  which is meant to reduce sanyo semiconductor s existing operational costs to market based costs 
this operational support relates to  among other things  costs  expenses and other amounts associated with seconded employees  the services agreement  and various lease agreements 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to take advantage of all of the optional support available or that  following the expiration of such operational support  margin levels of sanyo semiconductor will have improved to the point that we are able to operate sanyo semiconductor profitably 
in addition  we expect that the sanyo transaction will allow for cross selling opportunities between the company and the acquired company and its customers  but we cannot guarantee that these cross selling opportunities will be as great as anticipated or result in synergies  as expected 
ultimately  failure to realize anticipated synergies  complete planned restructuring or executed on expected opportunities from the sanyo transaction may lead to lower revenues and lower margins than anticipated in the future 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions  including restructuring activities  could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to  among other things  significant downturns in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
in the past  we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  we have gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines  china  thailand and vietnam 
we expect to consolidate the japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites 
much of the reduction in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities 
we also expect to continue the existing sanyo semiconductor plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in their taiwan and hong kong manufacturing locations 
furthermore  we currently anticipate that we will incur restructuring charges of approximately billion to billion million to million related to severance payments of seconded employees in connection with the shutdown of certain sanyo semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
a significant portion of these charges are expected in the first quarter of we currently expect that payments related to the restructuring will be made over the next eighteen months 
we cannot assure you that future cost reduction initiatives  including the current restructuring plan for sanyo semiconductor  will be successfully or timely implemented  or will materially impact our profitability 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business  including unintended employee attrition 
for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this form k 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to continue to aggressively manage  maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  further expand our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and integrate newly acquired products  manufacturing capabilities and sales channels 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

table of contents we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
the development of new products is a complex and time consuming process 
new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
moreover  we may make significant investment in new products that may not be profitable or have margins as high as we have experienced historically 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
furthermore  short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 
competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of recent economic uncertainty  competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified  as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

table of contents the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors  particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations  may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories  presence in key markets  patent protection  and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that  in some cases  are integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as from customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we  and our competitors  continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities  changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of the sanyo transaction  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity  if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing  information technology and equipment to remain competitive  the failure  inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and such capital expenditures and commitments  as well as other commitments  may materially decrease our liquidity 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

table of contents we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency 
any such implementation  however  can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation  any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or  in some instances  to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned 
in the case of abandonment  we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 
in addition  we have had and expect to have significant cash and capital expenditures related to the sanyo transaction 
for instance  we have committed a significant amount of cash on hand to cover the purchase price and other costs and expenses related to the sanyo transaction 
although we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to this transaction  we believe that cash flow from operating activities  coupled with the remaining cash on hand  cash equivalents and funds from external borrowings  will be adequate to operate our business and otherwise satisfy our capital needs 
however  to the extent that transaction expenses exceed projections or we are unable to generate expected cash flows  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives related to the sanyo transaction 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available  or if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
in the recent past  we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful 
however  these reductions  and any future reductions  may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity 
ultimately  we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in  among other areas  manufacturing  information technology and equipment 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 
if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and  in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
in addition  the integration of the business acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction will require significant coordination and we cannot assure you that our existing customer relationships or sanyo semiconductor s current customer relationships will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of uncertainty in connection with or other factors relating to the newly combined entity 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including polysilicon  silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

table of contents in addition  for some of our products  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asia pacific region  the americas  and europe including the middle east 
similarly  we maintain significant operations in these regions 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations including collective bargaining agreements and workers councils  exposure to foreign labor laws  and other employment and labor issues  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
in the last few fiscal years  we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis 
for instance  proposed income tax regulations in the united states could  under our existing tax structure  significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  business combinations and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate 
other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
for instance  while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

table of contents if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success  both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions  such as sanyo semiconductor  depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and financial personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
in addition  from time to time  we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses  mandatory unpaid time off  factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel 
these measures  as well as any future cost reduction measures  could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization 
moreover  we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time 
we have also issued rsu s with time based vesting and performance based awards 
any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards 
our stock price at times has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on various registered and unregistered intellectual property assets  patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization and subsequent acquisitions  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted  transferred or assigned in connection with our recapitalization or subsequent acquisitions will provide competitive advantages to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that were assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization or subsequent acquisitions will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party intellectual property rights 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses 
table of contents will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 
we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights  which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 
our ability to enforce our patents  copyrights  software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks  as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries 
when we seek to enforce our rights  we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid  is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim 
in addition  our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us  which may adversely impact our business 
an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  which could in turn negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 
we are subject to litigation risks  including securities class action litigation  which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit  including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters  most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations 
these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers  employment and labor  and intellectual property 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents as mentioned above  from time to time  we have been  or may in the future be  involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party 
these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this report for more information on our legal proceedings  including our pending securities class action litigation 
we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards  including section of the sarbanes oxley act 
like most publicly traded companies  we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  which requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm 
as we continue to make strategic acquisitions  mergers and alliances  the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls 
while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design  implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 
we are required to incorporate sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting by december  currently  sanyo semiconductor is a foreign corporation and was not required to comply with sox section requirements 
the integration of sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting will require additional time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact that the integration of sanyo semiconductor following the consummation of the sanyo transaction will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting  however  there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company s internal control over financial reporting in the future 
failure to comply with sox  including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting following the consummation of the sanyo transaction  or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of this transaction  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
in addition  if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements  our financial statements may be materially inaccurate  our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
see part ii  item a controls and procedures of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and ground 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and 
table of contents worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design  original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that we participate in a product recall  would have adverse effects that could be material on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
new legal requirements  particularly with respect to health care reform  could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel 
changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business  liquidity and results of operations 
in particular  the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system 
this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
despite the fact that we have recently retired some of our historic debt obligations with existing cash flow  we are still highly leveraged and have recently assumed more debt in connection with the sanyo transaction 
table of contents and therefore have substantial debt service obligations 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements may contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  as our long term debt ages  we may need to reclassify or repay such debt or seek additional financing see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report under contractual obligations within the liquidity and capital resources section  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 
we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us along with our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next months  if we incur additional debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities 
moreover  the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness  which would place our assets at risk  as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets 
ultimately  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms  or at all  and we may need to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate  including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 
the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements from time to time may contain  and any future debt agreements may include  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  
table of contents make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions  and issue some types of preferred stock 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations 
in addition  to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations  we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
in addition to the other factors described above  factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  
table of contents the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation or as a result of the consummation of the sanyo transaction  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements  our liquidity and access to capital  and our research and development activities and the funding thereof 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions create a board of directors with staggered terms  permit only our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders  
table of contents establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval  and require the approval by holders of at least of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
although we believe these provisions make a higher third party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

item properties our corporate headquarters as well as certain manufacturing  design center  and research and development operations are located in approximately million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix  arizona 
we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices  design centers  research and development labs  warehouses  logistic centers  trading offices and manufacturing support 
the size and or location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements 
we operate distribution centers  which are leased or contracted through a third party  in locations throughout asia  europe and the americas 
we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states  japan  malaysia  the philippines  the czech republic  thailand and belgium 
these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations  but also include office  utility  laboratory  warehouse and unused space 
additionally  we own research and development facilities located in romania  canada and east greenwich  rhode island 
our joint venture in leshan  china also owns manufacturing  warehouse  laboratory  office and other unused space 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility  excluding the subsurface rights  and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility 
these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola s environmental clean up operations at the phoenix facility 
we executed a declaration of covenants  easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land 
our remaining unused property and buildings at our phoenix  arizona site are currently being marketed for sale or lease 
we will continue to use the phoenix facility as our corporate headquarters 
with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  we gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines  china  thailand and vietnam 
we expect to consolidate sanyo semiconductor japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites  resulting in a footprint in japan of roughly million square feet in fabrication space and approximately million in assembly and test space 
outside of japan we currently own or lease through sanyo semiconductor and its subsidiaries approximately million square feet of space 
much of the reductions in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities 
we expect to continue the existing sanyo plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in the taiwan and hong kong manufacturing companies 
we believe that our facilities around the world  whether owned or leased  are well maintained 
we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our 
table of contents business lines for the foreseeable future 
however  significant upturns have  from time to time  led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner 
see part i  item business manufacturing operations and sales  marketing and distribution included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 
item legal proceedings we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation  should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable  our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
securities class action litigation during the period july  through july   we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers  current and former directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering 
the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york district court as abrams v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no cv  breuer v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv  and cohen v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv on april   the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering 
the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement 
the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages 
we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city  which have all been transferred  along with the case against us  to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management 
we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended  and intend to continue to defend  the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain  however  and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 
on july   together with the other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated  amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants 
the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation  and they are no longer parties to the litigation 
on february   the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants 
in that ruling  the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions 
as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice  and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to re plead these claims 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded  the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well 
the district court also denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss in all respects 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
had it been approved by the district court  this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the 
table of contents litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
this proposed issuer settlement was conditioned on  among other things  a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement  such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 
on december   the us court of appeals for the second circuit court of appeals issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due  in part  to the court of appeals determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes 
on january   the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling 
on april   the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs petition for rehearing of the court of appeals december  ruling 
the court of appeals  however  noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december  decision 
in light of the court of appeals december  decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs claims  the district court entered an order on june  terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers  including us 
on august   the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases 
the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants separately moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
on march   the district court issued an order in which it denied in substantial part the motions to dismiss the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
on february   the parties advised the district court that they had reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation in its entirety 
a stipulation of settlement was filed with the district court on april  on june   the district court preliminarily approved the proposed global settlement 
notice was provided to the class  and a settlement fairness hearing  at which members of the class had an opportunity to object to the proposed settlement  was held on september  on october   the district court issued an order granting final approval to the settlement 
ten appeals were filed objecting to the definition of the settlement class and fairness of the settlement  five of which have been dismissed with prejudice 
two appeal briefs have been filed by the remaining objector groups  and those appeals remain pending 
the settlement calls for a total payment of million from all defendants  including underwriters  of which million is allocated to the approximately issuer defendants 
under the settlement  our insurers are to pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to us  and we would bear no financial liability 
we  as well as the officer and director defendants current and former who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements  are to receive complete dismissals from the case 
while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings  based upon our current knowledge  we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
intellectual property matter we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the ordinary course of business  we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another party s rights 
these threats may seek that we make royalty payments  that we stop use of such rights  or other remedies 
prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march   in january  ricoh company  ltd 
ricoh filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against amis and other parties including synopsys  inc synopsys  alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh 
amis promptly tendered the defense of this claim to synopsys  and synopsys agreed to assume the defense of the case on amis behalf to the extent that the synopsys software that amis licensed from synopsys is alleged to constitute the basis of ricoh s claim of infringement 
the case has been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of 
table of contents california 
ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement 
the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors 
the case was scheduled to go to trial in march  however  in december  the court issued an order staying the case pending a re examination proceeding filed by synopsys before the us patent trademark office pto challenging the validity of the patent claims at issue in this case 
since that time  synopsys filed a total of three re examination petitions with the pto challenging the validity of the claims at issue  which the pto granted and consolidated all three re examinations into one proceeding before a single examiner 
the re examination proceeding was completed in september  and the pto examiner issued a final rejection of all claims in the asserted patent over prior art 
ricoh has appealed that final rejection to the pto board of appeals  which held a hearing on the appeal on september  the board of appeals is expected to issue its written decision on the appeal within the next several months 
in april  the court lifted the stay despite the ongoing re examination proceeding in the pto 
in september  the court granted defendants request to refile a summary judgment motion on non infringement that had been vacated as moot when the stay was imposed in december on march   the judge issued a ruling denying the summary judgment motion without prejudice because of a factual dispute over a patent claim element 
after an exchange of briefs by the parties related to the disputed claim element  the judge held a further hearing on the matter on june  on october   the judge issued his ruling on the disputed claim element 
based on the judge s ruling  synopsys filed another motion for summary judgment on non infringement on january  a hearing on that motion was held on march  and on april   the judge granted synopsys motion for summary judgment 
on april   ricoh filed a motion for reconsideration on the summary judgment ruling 
on may   the judge denied the ricoh motion and entered final judgment in synopsys favor for non infringement 
ricoh subsequently filed a notice of appeal on june  and served its brief on appeal on august  counsel for synopsys filed its responsive brief on october  oral arguments are scheduled to occur as early as february and a decision on the appeal is likely in the spring of we believe that the asserted claims are without merit  and even if meritorious  that we will be indemnified against damages by synopsys  and that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

cv gms 
the lawsuit was brought by a stockholder of on semiconductor corporation and alleges generally that on semiconductor corporation s proxy statement contained materially false and misleading information regarding our amended and restated stock incentive plan plan in violation of the federal securities laws  the plan was defective and  thus  any awards made pursuant to the plan would not be tax deductible pursuant to section m of the internal revenue code and applicable regulations  and the individual defendants who are on semiconductor corporation officers and directors violated their state law fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets in connection with the adoption of the plan 
we have moved to dismiss the lawsuit 
we deny the substantive allegations made in the lawsuit and intend to vigorously defend against them 
while we make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of this proceeding  based upon our current knowledge  we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

industry overview according to wsts  worldwide semiconductor industry sales were billion in  an increase of from billion in we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components 
the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market exclusive of the results from our sanyo transaction since year ended december  worldwide semiconductor industry sales percent change total addressable market sales percent change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises its information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules  sp logic and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only  d sp logic consumer other  computer other peripherals  wired communications  automotive and industrial  e cmos image sensors  and f memory 
worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by in  decreased by in  and grew by in following a pattern consistent with the movements in the global economy 
sales in our total 
table of contents addressable market grew significantly in  reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any price declines 
sales in our total addressable market dropped to billion in and returned to billion in exhibiting slightly more volatility than the whole industry 
the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately for the next three years 
these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 
recent results our total revenues for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of from  million for the year ended december   the majority of which was due to an increase in volume and mix of products sold during during  we reported net income of million compared to million in our gross margin increased by approximately basis points to in from in the primary reason for the increase is attributable to increases in volume driving better factory utilization  cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and a lower amount of expensing of fair market value step up of inventory acquired in business acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 
outlook on semiconductor q outlook excluding expected results of sanyo semiconductor based on current booking trends  backlog levels and estimated turns levels  we anticipate that revenues will be approximately million to million in the first quarter of backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of represent over of our anticipated first quarter revenues 
we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of will be down approximately to compared to the fourth quarter of we estimate cash capital expenditures of approximately million to million in the first quarter of of which million to million is related to carry forwards from for the first quarter of  we estimate gross profit as a percentage of revenues to be approximately to 
for the first quarter of  we estimate total operating expenses of approximately million to million  which includes amortization of acquisition related intangibles assets  restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
we anticipate interest expense  net of interest income  and other will be approximately million  which includes non cash interest expense of approximately million relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes 
we estimate the provision for income taxes to be approximately million in the first quarter of  with cash payments of income taxes to be approximately million in the first quarter of we also estimate share based compensation expense of approximately million to million in the first quarter of  which is included within operating expense above

we currently anticipate that sanyo semiconductor will generate operating losses in the first quarter of from  among other items  purchase accounting and acquisition related costs 
business overview the aforementioned information is exclusive of items related to our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor 
we are a premier supplier of high performance  silicon solutions for energy efficient electronics 
our broad portfolio of power and signal management  logic  discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in automotive  communications  computing  consumer  industrial  led lighting  medical  
table of contents military aerospace and power applications 
we design  manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products 
our power management semiconductor components control  convert  protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices 
our custom application specific integrated circuits use analog  digital signal processing  mixed signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive  medical  military  aerospace  consumer and industrial customers unique products 
our data management semiconductor components provide high performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems 
our standard semiconductor components serve as building block components within virtually all types of electronic devices 
these various products fall into the logic  analog and discrete categories used by wsts 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical 
during a down cycle  unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem  resulting in revenue declines 
in response to such declines  manufacturers have shut down production capacity 
when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen  production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again 
as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities  shortages have begun to occur  which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers  thus prompting further capacity expansion 
such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand  which has triggered another similar cycle 
new product innovation as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives  excluding the introduction of lead free products  we introduced new product families in there were new product families in our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
as always  it is our practice to regularly re evaluate our research and development spending  to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly 
we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth 
as a result  we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic  analog  memory and discrete products 
we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 
cost savings and restructuring activities we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and  as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on transferring production to lower cost regions  increasing die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner by moving production from wafers to wafers and smaller geometrics resulting in an increase to the number of die per wafer  reducing the number of product platforms and process flows  and focusing production on profitable product families 
macroeconomic environment we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure  however  the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection 
table of contents with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
these macroeconomic factors have affected our customers and suppliers which in turn has affected our business  including sales  the collection of receivables  and results of operations 
although we view many of these macroeconomic environment issues as temporary  our continuing outlook for the future will ultimately affect our future emphasis on marketing to various industries  our future research and development efforts into new product lines and our segments in general

other operating expense goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions  by reporting unit  annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of the first day of the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that based on a decline in our business outlook for one of our reporting units  million of carrying value of goodwill relating to our acquisition of pulsecore  and million of carrying value of intangibles was impaired 
accordingly  we recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and intangible asset impairment of million in the digital and mixed signal product segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that based on current market conditions and a decline in our business outlook  primarily due to the macroeconomic environment  million of the carrying amount of our goodwill was impaired 
the goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting units was primarily from our december  acquisition of the ptc business and our march  acquisition of amis

liquidity and capital resources this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements  our off balance sheet arrangements  our contingencies  our sources and uses of cash  our debt and debt covenants  and our management of cash 
cash requirements contractual obligations on january   we paid approximately million in cash and entered into a million note payable as consideration for the purchase of sanyo semiconductor  and related assets 
included in the assets acquired was approximately million in cash 
while we expect in the near term for sanyo semiconductor to require cash to fund its restructuring and capital expenditure requirements  we believe our combined cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  when adjusted for the net cash payment of million related to the sanyo transaction  along with the expected positive cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next months 
the table below does not contain obligations that will be assumed in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor  which closed on january  our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long term debt  operating leases  pension obligations and purchase obligations

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december  we believe that our cash flows from operations  coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system  desk top computers  communications  foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 
in the normal course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us  as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments  agreements to mitigate collection risk  leases or customs guarantees 
a bank guarantee issued on our behalf under a non reusable commitment credit with the bank has an outstanding amount of million as of december  the belgian bank that issued the guarantee has the right to create a mortgage on the real property of one of our european subsidiaries in the amount of million but had not done so as of december  we also have outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our non reusable commitment credit totaling million at december  as part of securing financing in the normal course of business  we issued guarantees related to certain of our capital lease obligations and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately million as of december  for our operating leases  we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling million as payments come due 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases  letters of credit and guarantee arrangements 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party 
table of contents against losses due to intellectual property infringement  property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct  or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 
we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors  we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customers for valid warranty claims 
we  from time to time  have been active in merger and acquisition activity 
in connection with these mergers or acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the other party or parties to the merger or acquisition agreement for certain claims or occurrences  limited in most instances  by time and or monetary amounts 
we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors  officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements  certificates of incorporation  by laws  articles of association or similar organizational documents  as the case may be 
we maintain directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this report and note commitments and contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i  item business government regulation of this report for information on certain environmental matters 
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  to repurchase our stock and other company securities  and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including changes in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  effective management of our manufacturing capacity  our 
table of contents ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise  including interest rate fluctuations  macroeconomic conditions  sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing  and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time 
our ability to service our long term debt including our senior subordinated notes  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
operations our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash  and our management of our assets and liabilities  including both working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
each of these components is discussed below 
working capital working capital fluctuates depending on end market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables  inventory and payables 
in times of escalating demand  our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production 
our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs  which may require us to use cash for severance payments  asset transfers and contract termination costs 
our working capital  including cash  was million at december  our working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was million at december   and has fluctuated between million and million over the last eight quarter ends

the decrease of million in short term investments is the result of investments maturing as cash and cash equivalents 
the increase of million in receivables  net is the result of increased revenues at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to the end of the fourth quarter of the increase of million in inventories is the result of increased production needs to satisfy increased demand for products during the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of the increase of million in other current assets is the result of prepayments of various items 
the increase of million in accounts payable is the result of increased purchase of property  plant and equipment combined with an increase in purchases for production of inventory during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the increase of million in accrued expenses is the result of increases in accrued bonus and accrued payroll 
the increase of million in deferred income on sales to distributors is the result of increased inventories at our distributors 
the decrease of million in current portion of long term debt was primarily due to the reclassification of the principal balance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes to long term debt as a result 
table of contents of the amendment to the notes which modified the next potential call option to be on april   partially offset by new short term financing and capital leases 
long term assets and liabilities our long term assets consist primarily of restricted cash  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently 
we believe that near term access to additional manufacturing capacity  should it be required  could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 
our long term liabilities  excluding long term debt  consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves 
in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans  generally  our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate 
this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions

key financing events overview for the past several years  starting in  we have undertaken various measures to reduce our long term debt  reduce related interest costs and  in some cases  extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility

december chinese loan in december  one of our chinese subsidiaries entered into a million short term loan agreement with a chinese bank for working capital purposes 
the loan  which bore interest payable quarterly based on month libor plus per annum which matured and was repaid in the fourth quarter of april amended indenture for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due in april  we unilaterally amended the indenture for our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the amendments include one additional opportunity to require us to repurchase the notes on april  the terms of this put option are otherwise identical to pre existing terms of the notes whereby holders of the notes had the option to require us to purchase the notes on april   and terms eliminating our ability to redeem the notes at our option from april  until april  in accordance with the right of the holders of the notes to require us to purchase the notes on april   approximately million of the million par value of notes then outstanding were purchased by us 
in accordance with asc debt  the amendment was considered a substantial modification for accounting purposes  therefore  the million original remaining debt was deemed to be extinguished  resulting in a million gain  and new convertible debt with fair value of million was deemed to be issued 

table of contents asc requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument 
thus  the liability component of the new convertible debt was recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using a discount rate equivalent to the borrowing rate at the date of the modification of the convertible notes for similar debt instruments without conversion feature 
the equity component of the new convertible debt was recorded as additional paid in capital and represents the difference between the fair value of the modified convertible notes and the liability component 
it also requires an accretion of the debt discount resulting from the allocation of a portion of the modified fair value to equity over the life of the convertible notes  which is expected to be the next put date 
as a result  we recognized million of debt discount  which will be amortized through april may prepayment senior bank facility in may  we terminated our senior bank facilities by making a full prepayment of the million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the term loan portion 
this amount would have been due in september  subject to scheduled principal amortization and other required prepayments under the senior bank facilities 
we incurred no penalties in connection with this early termination 
the termination of the senior bank facilities also resulted in the termination of the million of undrawn revolver and termination of certain ancillary agreements executed in connection with the senior bank facilities in august and amended over the years  including the pledge agreement  security agreement and guarantee agreement 
pursuant to the pledge agreement  security agreement  and guarantee agreement  our obligations and the obligations of certain of our subsidiaries under the senior bank facilities and related documents were secured by a first lien on substantially all of our property and assets tangible and intangible  including the capital stock of certain subsidiaries  and substantially all of the property and assets tangible and intangible of certain of our subsidiaries 
the senior bank facilities contained customary representations and warranties  restrictive covenants  and default provisions 
the termination of our senior bank facilities negatively impacts our liquidity  but provides additional financial and operational flexibility 
since the termination  we continue to generate strong free cash flow and we remain committed to improving the capital structure of the company and shareholder value

table of contents new accounting pronouncements adopted adoption of asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements 
specifically  the new guidance requires disclosure of amounts transferred in and out of levels and fair value measurements  a reconciliation presented on a gross basis rather than a net basis of activity in level fair value measurements  greater disaggregation of the assets and liabilities for which fair value measurements are presented and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the new guidance around the level activity reconciliations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
adoption of sfas no 
revised  business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r is included in asc business combinations and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as the goodwill acquired 
significant changes from previous practice resulting from sfas r include the expansion of the definitions of a business and a business combination 
for all business combinations whether partial  full or step acquisitions  the acquirer will record of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill  generally at their fair values  contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and  for certain arrangements  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement  and acquisition related transactions and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors 
we also generate revenue  although to a much lesser extent  from manufacturing services provided to customers 
distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry  some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor  while others  like us  recognize the revenue when the sale is made to the end customer 
additionally  there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors  which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging 
due to our high distributor sales  revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or 
table of contents determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet given our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors 
we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user 
inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions  including value added and excise taxes  are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience 
our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 
sales to distributors  however  are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow moving products 
under our general agreements  distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book 
in addition  agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
however  since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product  due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  estimated returns and allowances  and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized  and are netted against revenues 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period  and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will  at the time of shipment  be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications 
our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer s standard warranty provided that the customer s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
in addition  we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time  generally days after shipment 
we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues  based on experience with each customer 
freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 
inventories 
we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 
inventory obtained in the purchase of a business is stated at the lower of cost or market 
upon the acquisition of a company such as catalyst  amis  pulsecore  cmd or sdt  we used management estimates to determine the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date 
the methodology involves stepping up the 
table of contents value of acquired finished goods and work in process to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose 
the initial million in the inventory step up for the acquisitions has been expensed to the statement of operations when the inventory was shipped to the customer  leaving no inventory and inventories at distributors at december  as this inventory is shipped to customers  it will significantly decrease the gross profit reported on those future sales until the inventory is completely sold 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
additionally  throughout  and  no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized 
as of december  and  deferred tax assets and liabilities before valuation allowance were million and million  respectively  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 
in recent years  most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned  sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value 
when material  these gains are recorded in the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company performs its annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
our methodologies used for valuing goodwill have not changed 
we have determined that our product families  which are components of our operating segments  constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill  because they are one level below the operating segments  they constitute individual businesses  and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family 
as of each acquisition date  all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition 
the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 
we determined the 
table of contents fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach  which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date 
we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill for all reporting units was recoverable  however during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill for one of our product families may not be recoverable 
after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for this one product family  we recognized a total charge of million from our digital and mixed signal product group 
as the fair value of the impaired reporting unit was million  a change in the discount rate would have no effect on the impaired reporting unit tested 
additionally  during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill for eight of our product families may not be recoverable 
after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for those eight product families  we recognized a total charge of million of which million was from our computing and consumer product group and million was from our digital and mixed signal product group 
we use the income approach  based on estimated future cash flows  to perform the goodwill impairment test 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross profits  operating expenses  and industry trends 
we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach less desirable than the income approach to perform the goodwill impairment test because there are no stand alone companies that exclusively sell the products that are similar to those sold by our reporting units 
the material assumptions used for the income approach for  and were five years of projected net cash flows  a discount rate of  and  respectively and a long term growth rate of  and  respectively 
we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 
the total fair value of the impaired reporting units in was million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the fair value of the eight impaired reporting units tested by approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the long term growth rate would have impacted the fair value by approximately million 
a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the long term growth rate would have required us to perform further analysis that may have resulted in an impairment charge for one or both of the reporting units with material goodwill balances that were at risk 
factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment review and possible impairment loss for these two reporting units include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if current economic conditions worsen  causing decreased revenues and or increased costs  we may have further material goodwill impairments 
the fair value of the remaining seven reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values as of the date of the last impairment test  which was as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed in our fourth quarter of  however  if any potential triggering event occurs during any future interim period  an assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill may result in an impairment charge that may be material 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our foreign employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and 
table of contents assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
for example  as of december   a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities  the expense impact would be approximately million 
valuation of stock compensation 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model 
the lattice model uses a constant volatility  an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior  and the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on the available information  we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  which is included in asc milestone method of revenue recognition 
the asu codifies the consensus reached in eitf  milestone method of revenue recognition  eitf  which addresses the accounting when entities enter into revenue arrangements with multiple payment streams for a single deliverable or a single unit of accounting 
the pronouncement shall be applied prospectively to milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after june   with earlier application and retrospective application permitted 
we do not expect the provisions of asu no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early application is permitted 
we do not expect the provisions of asu to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  however  we will have additional disclosure requirements related to the sanyo acquisition which was closed on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
however  some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the 
table of contents related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
