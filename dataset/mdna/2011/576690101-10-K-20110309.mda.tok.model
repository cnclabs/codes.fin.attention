item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated producer of high performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical  electronic  thermal and structural applications 
our products are sold into numerous markets  including consumer electronics  defense and science  industrial components and commercial aerospace  energy  automotive electronics  telecommunications infrastructure  medical and appliance 
sales of billion in were higher than sales in and established a record high 
the demand from various key markets  after a steep fall off in largely due to the global economic crisis  improved significantly in sales also improved in as a result of two acquisitions  higher metal prices and product and market development efforts 
sales from each of our four reportable segments grew at double digit rates in over gross margin of million in was million higher than the gross margin generated in the margin also improved to of sales in from of sales last year 
the margin improvement was largely due to a combination of the higher sales volume from existing operations and the acquisitions  operating efficiencies partially due to higher production volumes  product mix effects and other factors 
after reducing our manufacturing  selling and administrative costs in due to the fall off in sales  portions of these costs increased in in order to support the higher level of business 
the spending level did not increase proportionately with sales  however  which allowed us to leverage the sales growth to generate additional profits 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was mainly a result of the expenses incurred by the acquisitions and higher incentive compensation due to our improved profitability 
operating profit was million in  a significant turn around from the million operating loss in diluted earnings per share grew to in from a per share loss of in in the first quarter  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of academy corporation academy for an adjusted purchase price of million in cash 
academy s precious and non precious metal products and metal refining capabilities augment our existing product offerings as well as expand our reach into various new markets 
the academy acquisition closely followed our purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of barr associates  inc barr in october for million in cash 
our working capital levels  after declining in  increased in as a result of and in support of the improved business levels 
cash flow from operations totaled million in this cash flow plus an increase of million in debt during was used to finance capital expenditures and the acquisition of academy 
as a result of the higher debt levels  our debt to debt plus equity ratio increased to as of year end from as of year end results of operations millions except per share amounts net sales operating profit loss income loss before income taxes net income loss diluted earnings per share sales of billion were million  or  higher than sales of million in  while sales in declined million  or  from the sales level of million 
demand from the majority of our key markets improved in over demand had fallen significantly in from the level largely as a result of the global economic crisis and the related impact on consumer spending 
demand levels hit the near term low point in the first quarter and then began improving over the 
table of contents balance of the overall demand remained strong throughout as order entry levels exceeded sales in each quarter of and also established a record high for the year 
consumer electronics is our largest market  accounting for of sales in sales to this market were affected the most by the global economic crisis in and showed the most improvement in consumer electronics sales grew in as a result of an increase in consumer spending as well as the development of new applications as our materials are used in the latest generation of smart phones and in a number of other wireless and hand held devices 
sales of our materials for new and growing led applications also contributed to the higher sales to the consumer electronics market in sales to the defense and science market  which accounted for of total sales in  grew in over as a result of improvements in our existing defense business and the inclusion of a full year of barr s defense business 
defense sales  after being solid in the first half of  softened in the second half of that year due to program delays and push outs and finished below the level 
sales to the industrial components and commercial aerospace market  which were of our total sales in  also contributed to the growth in sales in over commercial aerospace sales  which were soft in  improved in due to an increase in the build rate for aircraft utilizing our materials 
shipments of materials for heavy equipment and other industrial applications grew in as well 
automotive electronics sales in were approximately double the sales level in as sales improved in both the domestic and european markets in automotive electronics sales were approximately of our total sales in sales to this market had declined at a double digit rate in from shipments into europe  partially spurred by the lower value of the us dollar  helped offset a portion of the weakness in the us market in sales to the energy market were over of our total sales in we sell a variety of products into this expanding market and we have a number of growth platforms 
our traditional oil and gas materials contributed to the growth in energy market sales in as did sales for architectural glass applications through academy 
we also sell materials for new and developing solar energy  fuel cell and other energy related applications 
medical market sales were relatively unchanged in from after declining in from in  we temporarily lost sales to a key medical application customer as a result of lower manufacturing yields 
process improvements have been implemented and shipments to the customer have resumed in early other portions of our medical business improved in  including x ray window assemblies and related materials 
sales to the medical market were of total sales in we believe that the demand level in certain markets fell further in the first half of than the actual decline in consumer spending levels as a result of excess inventory levels in the downstream supply chain 
we also believe that a portion of the sales improvement in the first half of may have been due to a replenishment of these downstream inventory levels 
the acquisitions of barr and academy accounted for of the sales growth in over a large portion of academy s sales is a precious metal pass through 
sales are affected by metal prices as changes in precious metal and a portion of the changes in base metal prices  primarily copper  are passed on to our customers 
metal prices have been quite volatile over the last three years  with various metals reaching near term or all time record highs in the average copper price for was higher than while the average price was lower than the average price 
gold and other precious metal prices were higher on average in and than the immediate prior year 
the change in metal prices resulted in an estimated million net increase in sales in over and an estimated million decrease in sales in from domestic sales in were slightly more than double the level 
domestic sales had declined in from the level 
domestic sales include the majority of the sales from the two acquisitions as well as the majority of the impact of the higher metal price pass through between periods 
international sales  which are included in each of our reportable segments  improved in over after declining in from 
table of contents we implemented various cost saving initiatives beginning in the fourth quarter and throughout the first nine months of in response to the weakening order entry rate at that time 
these initiatives included a reduction in work force  reduced wage and compensation levels  elimination of overtime and a reduction in regular work hours in some cases  reduced discretionary spending and the cancellation or deferral of various projects and initiatives 
these efforts helped to offset the negative impact of the lower sales volume in with the improved volumes in  wage levels have been restored and various resources  including manpower and services  have been added back as needed to support the current and projected sales volumes 
however  total manpower  excluding the two acquisitions  as of year end was still lower than the third quarter manpower level which was just prior to when the global economic crisis began to significantly impact our business 
the cost control programs remain in place as changes have been made to help improve our total cost structure 
we estimate that spending on certain operating costs excluding materials and other manufacturing overhead and selling  general and administrative costs in  while higher than  was still lower than the level  excluding the impact of the acquisitions  despite the increase in sales volume 
gross margin of million in was million higher than the gross margin of million in gross margin also improved from of sales in to of sales in in  the gross margin was million  or of sales 
we estimate that the incremental margin generated by the higher sales volumes  including the sales from the two acquisitions  accounted for approximately of the gross margin improvement in over manufacturing efficiencies  in part due to the increased production levels  and cost control efforts also contributed to the margin growth in factory labor  other direct manufacturing costs and manufacturing overhead costs did not increase proportionately with the increase in sales in the overall change in product mix was favorable between and while pricing improvements were made in portions of our business 
yield losses and other inventory valuation adjustments at certain operations had a minor negative impact on overall margins in the lower sales volume in reduced margins by an estimated million from and was the primary cause for the overall decline in margins in from production levels were reduced in due to the lower sales and a reduction in inventory  which resulted in operating inefficiencies at various facilities that negatively affected margins 
the change in product mix was unfavorable in as compared to partially due to lower sales of higher margin generating beryllium containing products in the gross margin was also reduced by the cost of a manufacturing quality return  unplanned downtime on a key piece of equipment and inventory valuation adjustments 
the cost reduction efforts offset a portion of the negative impact of the above items on gross margin in as operating and overhead manufacturing costs were lower in than in the margin comparison between years was also affected by lower of cost or market charges of differing amounts each year as accounting regulations require inventory to be written down to its market value if it is below its cost 
as a result of the falling prices for certain items  primarily ruthenium containing materials  we recorded charges of million in  million in  and million in in the first quarter  we determined that the domestic defined benefit pension plan was curtailed due to the significant reduction in the workforce 
as a result of the curtailment and the associated plan remeasurement  we recorded a million one time benefit during the first quarter  million of which was recorded against cost of sales and million recorded against selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income and loss 
the all in expense on this plan  including the one time benefit in  was million in  million in and million in see critical accounting policies below 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the majority of the million increase in sg a expenses in over was due to a combination of the expenses incurred by the acquisitions and higher incentive compensation expenses 
sales related expenses and other 
table of contents costs had a minor impact on the increase 
the lower expense in as compared to was mainly due to the cost reduction efforts in light of the sales decline as manpower levels and costs and discretionary spending were cut in sales and distribution related expenses were lower in than in as well 
with the significantly improved sales volumes in  a portion  but not all  of the previously reduced resources were added back to support the current and projected growth in the business 
approximately of the increase in sg a expenses in over was due to the expenses incurred by barr and academy subsequent to their acquisition 
the incentive compensation expense on plans designed to pay in cash was million higher in than in and million lower in than in the changes in the annual expense between years were caused by the performance of the individual businesses relative to their plans objectives 
in  the majority of our operations exceeded their plans targets 
stock based compensation expense  including the expense for stock appreciation rights  restricted stock and performance restricted shares  was million in  million in and million in the comparison of stock based compensation expense between years may be affected by changes in plan design  the number of grants in a given year  actual performance relative to the plans objectives  movement in our stock price and other factors 
international sg a expenses  excluding incentive compensation which is included in the above paragraph  were approximately higher in than in a portion of this increase is due to translation rate differences 
international expenses were lower in than in largely due to the cost reduction efforts and a decline in sales related expenses 
severance and related costs associated with headcount reductions totaled million in and million in acquisition related expenses for legal  accounting and due diligence services associated with the barr and academy transactions totaled million in additional fees totaling million were incurred in as a result of a change in accounting regulations effective january   acquisition related expenses must be charged against income as incurred 
previously  these expenses would have been capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisitions 
other corporate administrative expenses were higher in than in partially as a result of the cost of various initiatives that were designed to provide long term benefits 
costs associated with changing our corporate name  along with our subsidiaries names  totaled approximately million in corporate expenses were down million in from in part due to the cost reduction efforts and the related impact on compensation and benefits 
information technology costs were also lower in than as were costs for various outside services 
research and development r d expenses were million in  million in and million in r d expenses were less than of sales in each of the last three years 
despite the corporate wide cost reduction efforts in light of the lower sales volume in  we increased our r d spending slightly in that year 
r d efforts are focused on developing new products and applications as well as continuing improvements in our existing products 
the litigation settlement gain of million in represents the favorable settlement of a lawsuit  net of legal fees  in which we sought recovery of our rights under a previously signed indemnity agreement 
there were no litigation settlement gains in or derivative ineffectiveness expense was million in  million in and million in we secured a copper derivative embedded in a debt obligation in that served as an economic hedge to changes in the value of our copper inventories 
however  the derivative did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and changes in its fair value were recorded against income as ineffectiveness expense 
the derivative was in a loss position of million as of year end as a result of an increase in the market price of copper since the derivative s inception 
forward contracts were secured in to hedge against further unfavorable changes in the embedded derivative s fair value 
the million of expense in was the net unfavorable change in the fair value of these instruments in the embedded derivative and forward contracts matured during 
table of contents derivative ineffectiveness expense of million in resulted from changes in the fair value of an interest rate swap that did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes 
this swap was terminated in the fourth quarter other net expense was million in  million in and million in see note o to the consolidated financial statements for the details of the major components of other net expense for each of the three years 
the major differences in other net expense between the years include the following amortization expense increased million in over and million in over primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired with barr and academy 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the metal consignment fee  after declining million in from  increased million in over as a result of higher metal prices  increased quantities of metal on hand and the inclusion of academy s requirements under the consignment lines in the expense was lower in than in as we reduced the quantity of metal on hand in response to the lower sales and production requirements in that year 
the barr purchase agreement included an earn out feature that would require us to make additional payments to the prior owners of barr based upon barr s performance against identified benchmarks over the to period 
the present value of the earn out was estimated to be million at the time of the acquisition and was recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  no payment was required to be made for based upon barr s actual performance relative to the benchmark for the year 
we determined that the fair value of this liability  based upon the current facts and circumstances and updated projections  should be reduced to million as of december  the million benefit from the reduction in the liability was recorded as income in the fourth quarter in accordance with accounting guidelines 
we donated our former headquarters building and the associated land to a non profit organization  which resulted in a write off of the carrying value of million to other net expense in the majority of this unfavorable impact on income before income taxes was offset by a favorable income tax adjustment 
foreign currency exchange and translation losses totaled million in  million in and million in these losses result from movements in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies  primarily the euro  yen and sterling  and the related impact on certain foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and transactions and the maturity of foreign currency hedge contracts 
the operating profit in was million  a million improvement over the million operating loss in this improvement was due to the higher margin generated by the increased sales volumes  the impact of the acquisitions and other factors offset in part by an increase in incentive compensation  metal consignment fees  amortization and other expenses 
the operating loss in was million lower than the operating profit of million generated in this reduction was primarily a result of the lower gross margin due to the decline in sales and other factors along with the derivative ineffectiveness loss offset in part by the operating and overhead spending savings from the cost reduction efforts  lower foreign currency exchange and translation losses and other items 
interest expense totaled million in  million in and million in the average outstanding debt levels were higher throughout than primarily as a result of the two acquisitions and the increase in working capital 
capital lease balances were higher in than as well 
the impact of the higher debt and capital lease levels on interest expense was partially offset by a lower effective borrowing rate in than in average debt levels for the full year were lower than in and the average borrowing rate was slightly lower as well 
the income loss before income taxes and the income tax expense benefit for each of the past three years were as follows dollars in millions income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit effective tax benefit rate 
table of contents the effects of percentage depletion a tax benefit resulting from our mining operations  foreign source income and deductions  the production deduction and other items were major causes of the differences between the effective and statutory rates in each of the three years 
the effect of executive compensation was also a cause for the difference between the effective and statutory rates in and the tax expense in included million for the reduction of a deferred tax asset as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act 
beginning in  we will no longer be able to claim an income tax deduction for prescription drug benefits provided to our retirees and reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program 
while this tax increase does not take effect until  accounting standards require that the carrying value of a deferred tax asset be adjusted in the period in which legislation changing the applicable tax law is enacted 
the tax expense included the unfavorable impact of a net million increase in the tax reserves that was recorded in accordance with accounting guidelines 
in  the tax benefit was increased by a net million reduction in the tax reserves while in the tax expense was affected by a net million reduction in tax reserves 
see note q to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory and effective tax rates 
net income was million  or per share diluted  in compared to a net loss of million  or per share diluted  in in  net income was million  or per share diluted 
segment disclosures in the first quarter  we announced the change of our name from brush engineered materials inc to materion corporation effective march  the names of all of our active subsidiaries are changing as well and each subsidiary will have materion as part of its name 
the legal and ownership structure of our subsidiaries remained unchanged 
this name change did not alter our senior management structure or how the chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our businesses 
we continue to have the same four reportable segments as we had previously with no change in their make up or reporting structure  although the names of those segments have changed 
advanced material technologies and services has been renamed as advanced material technologies  specialty engineered alloys is now known as performance alloys  beryllium and beryllium composites has been shortened to beryllium and composites  and engineered material systems has been changed to technical materials 
results by segment are shown in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the all other column in note m includes our parent company expenses  other corporate charges and the operating results of materion services inc formerly bem services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative and financial oversight services to our other businesses on a cost plus basis 
the all other column shows an operating loss of million in  million in and million in the loss was lower in than in as an increase in corporate spending and higher incentive compensation expense were more than offset by an increase in charges out to the business units and the difference in derivative ineffectiveness between periods 
the increased loss in the all other column in as compared to was due primarily to the million derivative ineffectiveness expense recorded in  the million litigation settlement gain recorded in and differences in the level of costs charged to the other units offset in part by lower corporate spending and other factors 
advanced material technologies millions net sales operating profit 
table of contents advanced material technologies manufactures precious  non precious and specialty metal products  including vapor deposition targets  frame lid assemblies  clad and precious metal preforms  high temperature braze materials  ultra fine wire  advanced chemicals  optics  performance coatings and microelectronic packages 
these products are used in wireless  semiconductor  photonic  hybrid and other microelectronic applications within the consumer electronics and telecommunications infrastructure markets 
other key markets for these products include medical  defense and science  energy and industrial components 
advanced material technologies also has metal cleaning operations and in house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customers scrap 
this segment has domestic facilities in new york  connecticut  wisconsin  new mexico  massachusetts and california and international facilities in asia and europe 
sales from advanced material technologies of million in grew million  or  over sales of million in sales in were lower than sales of million in the growth in was due to a combination of improved market conditions  product development efforts  higher metal prices and the two acquisitions 
the decline in sales in from was largely due to the impact of the global economic conditions  particularly for consumer electronics applications in the first half of  and lower sales for defense  medical and media applications offset in part by higher metal prices and other factors 
revenues for fabrication and other related charges from the buffalo  new york facility  this segment s largest operation  grew in over the buffalo facility manufactures vapor deposition targets  lids  wire and other precious metal products for various semiconductor and other microelectronic applications 
the key driver for this growth was improved demand from the consumer electronics market for materials for led and wireless and other hand held device applications 
demand from other markets served  including defense and science  grew as well 
refining revenue  after declining in from  also contributed to the growth in refining revenue is partially a function of the volume of precious metal products sold and the available quantity of metal in the market to be reclaimed 
sales of advanced chemicals  after declining in from due to the global economic crisis  improved approximately in from a large portion of this growth was due to sales of materials for led applications within the consumer electronics market as a result of the expanded use of led technologies and the development of new applications 
advanced chemicals are also used in the growing solar energy market as well as for optics and security applications 
sales of electronic packages  one of this segment s smaller product lines  grew in over due to improved demand for telecommunications infrastructure applications in asia 
sales of these products grew in over due to a change in technology in the market  we anticipate that sales of electronic packages may soften in sales for data storage applications  primarily magnetic head materials  showed modest growth in the first three quarters of over a sluggish  but softened in the fourth quarter  partially due to an inventory correction in the market place 
the acquisitions of academy and barr accounted for approximately of the increase in the segment s sales in over  while barr s sales subsequent to its acquisition in the fourth quarter helped offset a portion of the decline in total segment sales between and the addition of academy provided access to new markets and applications for us  including architectural glass and jewelry  as well as additional precious metal refining capabilities and capacity 
academy s operations in albuquerque  new mexico dovetail with our existing buffalo  new york operations and provide opportunities for enhanced operational efficiencies 
barr produces precision thin film optical filters used in defense  medical  telecommunications and other markets 
the acquisition of barr  coupled with our existing operations  expands our precision optics product line  allowing us to provide a broad array of optical filters across a wide band of wavelengths 
the barr facility faced various operational challenges that hampered sales in the first half of  including unsatisfactory on time delivery performance and other inefficiencies 
however  process changes were made throughout the year and performance and operating results improved in the second half of the year 
the backlog for precision optics was solid entering new applications within the defense and science market helped to drive improvements in sales and the order backlog 

table of contents offsetting a portion of the growth in the above products and markets was a decline in sales of large area special coatings to the medical market 
sales of these products  mainly precision precious metal coated polymer films  were lower in than in lower manufacturing yields and the inability to hold tolerances resulted in missed sales to a key customer and the loss of a portion of the business to our competitor in new processes have been developed and qualified with the customer and shipment levels began to ramp back up in the first quarter sales of polymer films to the medical market were softer in than a solid due to weaker demand and other factors 
sales of other materials to the medical market  primarily lids  were relatively unchanged throughout the to time frame 
we adjust our selling prices daily to reflect the current cost of the precious and various non precious metals sold 
while a change in the cost of the metal is generally a pass through to the customer  we generate a margin on our fabrication efforts irrespective of the type of metal used in a given application 
on average  the applicable metal prices were higher in and than the respective prior years 
we estimate that the higher metal prices increased sales by million in as compared to and million in as compared to total order entry for the segment exceeded sales by approximately in gross margins generated by advanced material technologies totaled million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the main cause for the million increase in gross margin in over was the margin benefit from the higher sales volume from the existing operations as well as from the two acquisitions 
this margin benefit was partially offset by the incremental manufacturing overhead costs incurred by the two acquisitions totaling million and the increased manufacturing overhead costs incurred by the existing operations of million 
the margin was adversely affected by the lower medical market sales  which typically generate higher margins 
approximately of academy s sales in were silver investment bars that generate very low margins 
these negative mix effects were generally offset by efficiencies and improvements in other areas 
gross margin as a percent of sales declined in from largely due to the higher precious metal price pass through in sales in and the addition of academy s sales  which have a very high metal content 
margins grew in on the reduced sales volume largely due to lower of cost or market charges of million in compared to million in this million benefit between years was partially offset by an estimated million margin impact from the lower sales volume 
lower yields on polymer strip products and various inventory valuation adjustments reduced margins by an estimated million in the change in product mix was slightly unfavorable in largely due to lower medical and defense sales 
manufacturing overhead costs at the existing facilities were reduced in  but these savings were partially offset by the inclusion of barr beginning in the fourth quarter 
sg a  r d and other net expenses from advanced material technologies were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in expenses incurred by academy and barr accounted for approximately of the increase in expenses in over the decline in expenses in was net of the million of sg a expenses incurred by barr since its acquisition in the fourth quarter incentive compensation expense was million higher in than  due to the improved performance in  and million higher in than various sales related expenses increased in to support the higher volumes 
r d costs increased in each of the last two years in order to support the current business and future growth 
corporate charges increased million in over after declining in from the level 
expenses were reduced in mainly in response to the lower sales volumes 
manpower levels and costs and discretionary spending items were reduced at various facilities during the year 
amortization of intangible assets increased million in over and million in over largely due to the acquisitions of academy and barr 

table of contents metal financing fees were million higher in than in due to the additional quantity of metal on hand due to the higher production requirements and from the inclusion of academy s requirements under the consignment lines and higher metal prices 
financing fees were million lower in than in primarily due to a reduction in the average quantity of metal on hand 
operating profit from advanced material technologies of million in was a million improvement over the operating profit of million in this improvement was due to the margin benefit from the higher sales volumes and other factors offset in part by higher expenses 
the acquisitions contributed to the improved profit in this segment in the operating profit in was more than double the profit of million earned in as a result of the margin improvement and lower expenses 
operating profit was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in performance alloys millions net sales operating profit loss performance alloys manufactures and sells three main product families strip products  the larger of the product families  include thin gauge precision strip and thin diameter rod and wire 
these copper and nickel alloys provide a combination of high conductivity  high reliability and formability for use as connectors  contacts  switches  relays and shielding 
major markets for strip products include consumer electronics  telecommunications infrastructure  automotive electronics  appliance and medical  bulk products are copper and nickel based alloys manufactured in plate  rod  bar  tube and other customized forms that  depending upon the application  may provide superior strength  corrosion or wear resistance  thermal conductivity or lubricity 
while the majority of bulk products contain beryllium  a growing portion of bulk products sales is from non beryllium containing alloys as a result of product diversification efforts 
applications for bulk products include oil and gas drilling components  bearings  bushings  welding rods  plastic mold tooling  and undersea telecommunications housing equipment  and beryllium hydroxide is produced at our milling operations in utah from our bertrandite mine and purchased beryl ore 
the hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and  to a lesser extent  by the beryllium and composites segment 
external sales of hydroxide from the utah operations were less than of performance alloys total sales in each of the three most recent years 
strip and bulk products are manufactured at facilities in ohio and pennsylvania and are distributed internationally through a network of company owned service centers and outside distributors and agents 
sales from performance alloys were million in  an improvement of million  or  over sales of million in this growth was due to improved demand from key markets  higher metal pass through prices and other price increases 
sales in were million  or  lower than sales of million in primarily due to the impact of the global economic crisis on shipments of both strip and bulk products 
sales to all major markets declined at double digit rates in from the levels 
the order entry rate  after an extremely weak first half of  improved in the second half of and then was quite strong during the majority of the improved demand for strip products fueled the growth in the order entry rate in the first half of while the demand for bulk products was stronger in the second half of total order entry exceeded the sales level in by 
sales of strip and bulk products grew in over after declining in from the growth in strip sales in was largely due to improved demand from the consumer electronics  appliance and automotive electronics markets 
the growth in sales to the consumer electronics market  performance alloys largest market  was fueled by the use of our materials in pdas  the latest generations of smart phones and other hand held devices 
automotive electronic sales were higher in as sales in were quite low  particularly in the first half of that year 
appliance sales grew approximately in over  primarily in europe 
the demand for strip 
table of contents products was stronger in the first half of than the second half of the year due to seasonality issues  model changeovers and the replenishment of downstream inventory positions 
the decline in strip sales in as compared to was mainly caused by the global economic crisis and the impact on consumer spending 
demand levels from the consumer electronics and automotive electronics markets declined severely  particularly in the first quarter market conditions improved somewhat in the second half of that year due to consumer electronic applications in asia and automotive and appliance applications in europe 
the growth in bulk product sales in over was across multiple markets 
demand from the oil and gas sector of the energy market improved throughout  partially as an aftermath of the gulf oil disaster in as customers turned to our products due to their high performance characteristics 
sales for oil and gas applications weakened in from due to excess inventory positions and because the price of oil was generally below the level that would spur significant exploration and production increases 
commercial aerospace sales grew in over as a result of an increase in the build rate of aircraft that utilize our materials 
aerospace sales in had declined from the level due to ongoing deferrals of new aircraft builds and decreased repair and maintenance activities 
sales of materials for heavy equipment and other applications within the industrial components market  including sales of non beryllium containing alloys  also contributed to the growth in bulk product sales in over strip product volumes ie  pounds shipped grew in over after declining in from bulk product volumes were higher in than in while volumes in were lower than total volumes rebounded in from the softness in and were essentially on par with the volumes shipped in copper prices were higher on average in than in and the increased copper price pass through accounted for an estimated million of the sales growth in lower copper prices reduced sales in by an estimated million from as demand declined beginning in the fourth quarter  performance alloys initiated various cost reduction efforts that continued throughout by the end of  the employment levels within manufacturing  sales and administration had been reduced by approximately people from the september level 
with the improvement in demand in and the increased production requirements and other business support needs  the employment level increased during however  the year end employment level was still lower than it was as of the end of the third quarter performance alloys generated a gross margin of million in  an improvement of million over the gross margin of million in the gross margin was million in gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in and of sales in the higher sales volume was the largest cause of the improved gross margin in  accounting for an estimated million of the increase 
production volumes were also higher in than in  which  combined with other factors  led to improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher machine utilization rates 
factory labor and other direct manufacturing costs  while higher in than in  did not increase proportionately with the volume increase  allowing us to leverage our production efforts 
higher selling prices for bulk and strip products also contributed to the margin increase in over as did a favorable change in the product mix 
manufacturing overhead costs increased million in over largely due to increases in maintenance and supply expenses offsetting a decline in utility expenses 
the depletion of a last in  first out lifo layer from inventory resulted in a net benefit to gross margin of million in this benefit may not recur to this extent or at all in the million margin decline in was primarily due to the million reduction in sales 
production volumes were even lower than sales in as inventories were worked down throughout the year 
the lower production volumes negatively affected margins as a result of increased manufacturing inefficiencies and lower machine utilization rates 
in addition  unplanned downtime on a key piece of equipment in the fourth quarter reduced margins by an estimated million 
the change in product mix was unfavorable in as well 
manufacturing overhead spending  including manpower and utilities  was lower in than and helped to 
table of contents mitigate a portion of the negative impact the above items had on margins 
pricing improvements implemented during also provided a small benefit to margins in the year 
total sg a  r d and other net expenses were million in  an increase of million over expenses of million in the expenses were million lower than expenses of million in expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the increased expense in on a dollar basis was due to higher incentive compensation which resulted from the significantly improved operating results  higher commissions due to the increased sales and higher corporate costs 
these increases were offset in part by a net decline in all of the other expenses incurred by performance alloys as many of the cost reduction efforts implemented during remained in place throughout cost savings were also obtained in as a result of the closing of the distribution center operation in the united kingdom in the fourth quarter sales to the united kingdom are now shipped from our german operations or through an independent distributor 
the lower expenses in as compared to were largely due to the aforementioned cost reduction efforts offset in part by severance costs 
sales related expenses  including commissions and advertising  were also lower in than in lower incentive compensation and foreign currency exchanges losses contributed to the decline in expenses in as well 
performance alloys earned an operating profit of million in  an improvement of million over the operating loss of million in the increase in profit was due to the margin generated by the higher sales  manufacturing improvements and improved pricing partially offset by changes in expenses 
the operating loss in was down million from the operating profit of million earned in due to the impact of the lower sales volumes and other factors partially offset by the cost saving efforts and other expense reductions 
beryllium and composites millions net sales operating profit beryllium and composites manufactures beryllium based metals and metal matrix composites in rod  sheet  foil and a variety of customized forms at the elmore  ohio and fremont  california facilities 
these materials are used in applications that require high stiffness and or low density and they tend to be premium priced due to their unique combination of properties 
this segment also manufactures beryllia ceramics produced at the tucson  arizona facility 
defense and science is the largest market for beryllium and composites  while other markets served include industrial components and commercial aerospace  medical  energy and telecommunications infrastructure 
products are also sold for acoustics and optical scanning applications 
sales from beryllium and composites were million in  an improvement of million  or  over sales of million in sales in were lower than sales of million in the majority of the sales improvement in over was due to growth in sales to the defense and science market 
sales to this market  which accounted for over half of beryllium and composites sales in  had declined in the second half of as a result of project funding delays and push outs at that time 
the primary defense platforms for these products are aerospace and missile system applications 
due to changes in government spending patterns  we anticipate that defense sales will be flat to softer in than in sales to the industrial components and commercial aerospace market  the segment s second largest market  also grew in over a portion of this growth was due to the development of new applications for albemet  a metal matrix composite  in semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
sales to the medical market improved in over after declining significantly in from shipments of x ray window assemblies nearly doubled in over a key driver for this growth is the conversion to digital x ray equipment  particularly in radiology and fluoroscopy systems 
shipments of beryllium foil for x ray applications also increased in over our x ray window assemblies and related materials are used in medical  scientific and industrial applications 

table of contents sales of ceramic products increased over in over after declining in from the growth in was largely due to increased shipments for applications within the telecommunications infrastructure market 
the decline in sales in was largely due to the global economic crisis and its impact in particular on a key ceramic products customer s business 
sales of beryllium speaker domes for acoustic diaphragm assemblies grew slightly in over but remained relatively minor 
this niche application presents potential growth opportunities for our materials 
the gross margin on beryllium and composites sales was million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the gross margin improved by an estimated million in over as a result of the higher sales volume 
the change in product mix was favorable in as compared to while manufacturing overhead costs were also lower in than in as we were able to leverage the existing cost base 
the difference in input materials  use of vendor scrap and reclamation efforts provided an estimated million net benefit in these margin benefits were partially offset by lower manufacturing yields on welded products that reduced margins by an estimated million in process improvements were implemented and yields on these products improved in the second half of the main cause of the decline in the gross margin dollars and rate in was the significant fall off in sales in that year 
the margin impact of the lower volumes was partially mitigated by a reduction in direct and overhead manufacturing costs  including manpower  supplies and utility costs 
material input costs increased in over and had a negative impact on margins 
the change in product mix was slightly unfavorable in sg a  r d and other net expenses were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the main driver for the increased expense level in was higher incentive compensation  due to the improved profitability  and higher corporate charges 
various sales and marketing support expenses  including commissions and travel  also increased in over the lower expense in was due to the cost reduction initiatives and reduced incentive compensation 
these benefits were partially offset by an increase in r d expenses 
beryllium and composites generated an operating profit of million in  an improvement of million over the operating profit of million generated in this improvement was due to the margin benefit from the higher sales and other factors offset in part by an increase in expenses 
operating profit in declined million from the million earned in  primarily as a result of the lower sales volume 
operating profit was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in technical materials millions net sales operating profit loss technical materials manufactures clad inlay and overlay metals  precious and base metal electroplated systems  electron beam welded systems  contour profiled systems and solder coated metal systems 
these specialty strip metal products provide a variety of thermal  electrical or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material 
our cladding and plating capabilities allow for a precious metal or brazing alloy to be applied to a base metal only where it is needed  reducing the material cost to the customer as well as providing design flexibility 
major applications for these products include connectors  contacts and semiconductors while the largest markets are automotive electronics and consumer electronics 
the defense and science  energy and medical markets are smaller but offer further growth opportunities 
technical materials products are manufactured at the lincoln  rhode island facility 
sales from technical materials of million in were nearly double the sales of million in while sales in were lower than sales of million in sales of all major product lines were higher in than in and total volumes shipped increased approximately in over 
table of contents the sales growth in over was due to improved demand from each of the key markets served as well as the continued product development efforts 
the significant decline in sales in was due to the impact of the global economic crisis on demand beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing into sales  after reaching their near term low point in the first quarter  improved sequentially in each quarter of sales in the first half of were higher than sales in the second half of partially due to the replenishment of downstream inventories in the first half of the year 
total order entry exceeded sales by approximately in automotive electronic sales in were more than twice the sales level from as both domestic and foreign shipments improved 
sales to this market declined significantly in  particularly in the us sales to the consumer electronics market grew approximately in over a portion of the growth in was attributable to a improvement in sales of disk drive arm materials 
after growing into a sizable portion of this segment s sales in  sales of disk drive arm materials declined sharply in the first quarter and  while shipment levels recovered somewhat over the balance of the year  sales in were still lower in than in sales to the medical and energy markets  while relatively minor  also contributed to the sales growth in over technical materials generated a gross margin of million in  million in and million in gross margin improved to of sales in after falling to of sales in from of sales in the million increase in gross margin in over was largely due to the million growth in sales while the associated higher production volumes helped generate improved manufacturing efficiencies as well 
factory labor and other direct manufacturing costs were added back in only as needed to meet the production schedule 
manufacturing overhead costs were million higher in than in the lower margin dollars and rate in were due to the severe decline in sales during the year 
the change in product mix was also unfavorable in in response to the lower sales  labor and other direct manufacturing costs were reduced approximately in from the level 
production schedules were revised to allow for manufacturing to be campaigned on various equipment lines in order to offset a portion of the inefficiencies created by the low production volumes 
manufacturing overhead costs  including manpower  maintenance and utilities  were also reduced by million in from the level 
while employment levels increased during  the total employment within technical materials was lower at year end than it was as of the third quarter sg a  r d and other net expenses were million in compared to million in and million in higher selling and marketing costs  including manpower  commissions and travel expenses  were the main cause of the increase in over incentive compensation costs and corporate charges were million higher in than in other net expenses  including the metal consignment fee and other miscellaneous items  contributed to the higher expense level in as well 
the lower expense level in as compared to was due to the spending reductions  implemented in reaction to the decline in sales  and lower incentive compensation and corporate charges 
technical materials generated an operating profit of million of sales in versus an operating loss of million in in  this segment earned an operating profit of million 
international sales and operations we operate in worldwide markets and our international customer base continues to expand geographically due to the development of various foreign nations economies and the relocation of us businesses overseas 
our international operations are designed to provide a cost effective method of capturing the growing overseas demand for our products 
in asia  we have strategically located our facilities in japan  singapore  china  korea  taiwan and the philippines 
our european facilities are in germany  the united kingdom  ireland and the czech republic 
these 
table of contents operations provide a combination of light manufacturing  finishing operations  local sales support and distribution services 
we also augment our sales and distribution efforts with an established network of independent distributors and agents throughout the world 
approximately of our workforce is based overseas 
the following chart summarizes total international sales by region for the last three years dollars in millions asia europe rest of world total percent of total sales international sales include sales from international operations and direct exports from our us operations 
the international sales in the above chart are included in the individual segment sales previously discussed 
total international sales grew million in over as demand improved from the majority of our key markets and from all regions 
sales to asia increased while european sales improved 
the lower international sales in were primarily due to the global economic crisis and the resulting fall off in demand  particularly from the consumer electronics market 
sales to asia declined in from the levels while sales to europe fell 
consumer electronics  automotive electronics  appliance primarily in europe and telecommunications infrastructure are the larger international markets for our products 
our market share is smaller in the overseas markets than it is domestically and  given the macro economic growth potential for the international economies  including the continued transfer of us business to overseas locations  the international markets  and asia in particular  may present greater long term growth opportunities 
sales from the european and certain asian operations are denominated in the local currency 
exports from the us and the balance of the sales from the asian operations are typically denominated in us dollars 
local competition generally limits our ability to adjust selling prices upwards to compensate for short term unfavorable exchange rate movements 
we have a hedge program with the objective of minimizing the impact of fluctuating currency values on our consolidated operating profit

legal proceedings one of our subsidiaries  materion brush inc formerly brush wellman inc  is a defendant in proceedings in various state and federal courts brought by plaintiffs alleging that they have contracted chronic beryllium disease or other lung conditions as a result of exposure to beryllium 
plaintiffs in beryllium cases seek recovery under negligence and various other legal theories and seek compensatory and punitive damages  in many cases of an unspecified sum 
spouses  if any  claim loss of consortium 
the following table summarizes the associated activity with beryllium cases 
december  total cases pending total plaintiffs including spouses number of claims plaintiffs filed during period ended number of claims plaintiffs settled during period ended aggregate cost of settlements during period ended dollars in thousands number of claims plaintiffs otherwise dismissed settlement payment and dismissal for a single case may not occur in the same period 

table of contents additional beryllium claims may arise 
management believes that we have substantial defenses in these cases and intends to contest the suits vigorously 
employee cases  in which plaintiffs have a high burden of proof  have historically involved relatively small losses to us 
third party plaintiffs typically employees of customers or contractors face a lower burden of proof than do employees or former employees  but these cases are generally covered by varying levels of insurance 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against our subsidiaries and us  we provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably in amounts exceeding our reserves 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or additional adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
we are unable to estimate our potential exposure to unasserted claims 
based upon currently known facts and assuming collectibility of insurance  we do not believe that resolution of the current and future beryllium proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flow 
however  our results of operations could be materially affected by unfavorable results in one or more of these cases 
the balances recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with beryllium litigation were as follows december  millions asset liability reserve for litigation insurance recoverable the settlement payments of  made in were not reimbursed by insurance since our total applicable costs were less than the annual deductible 
the million payment to settle three cases in was fully insured 
regulatory matters 
standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and by other governmental and private standard setting organizations 
one result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards 
some organizations  such as the california occupational health and safety administration and the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists  have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of osha 
the development  proposal or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium containing products 
if the standards are made more stringent and or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium containing products  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards  the cost and ability to meet the new standards  the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors 
the magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated 
financial position net cash provided from operations was million in as net income and the effects of depreciation  deferred taxes and other items more than offset increases in working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
the majority of the working capital build in occurred in the first half of the year as sales levels ramped up from the low levels in and resulted in cash being used in operations of million 
the growth in working capital levels began to level off in the second half of  which  coupled with a further increase in profitability  resulted in net cash provided from operations of million in the second half of the year 
in  we generated cash flow from operations of million as reductions in accounts receivable and inventory  the effects of depreciation and other items more than offset the net loss for the year 
cash provided from operations was a strong million in due to the net income  effects of depreciation and a reduction in working capital 

table of contents as previously noted  changes in the cost of precious and base metals are essentially passed on to customers 
therefore  while sudden movements in the price of metals can cause a temporary imbalance in our cash receipts and payments in either direction  once prices stabilize our cash flow tends to stabilize as well 
working capital cash totaled million as of year end compared to million at year end as the cash flow from operations  the increase in debt and proceeds from the exercise of stock options exceeded the cost to acquire academy and the capital expenditure funding requirements in the cash balance declined million during as a portion of the cash on hand  increased debt and the cash flow from operations were used to fund the acquisition of barr and capital expenditures during accounts receivable totaled million as of december   an increase of million  or  over the accounts receivable balance of million at december  the main driver for the increased receivable balance was the higher level of sales 
sales in the fourth quarter were million  or  higher than sales in the fourth quarter the days sales outstanding  a measure of how quickly receivables are collected  slowed by less than one day and had a minor impact on the increase in receivables in the expense for accounts written off to bad debts and changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts  while slightly higher in than  remained minor at million for the year 
we have procedures in place to closely monitor our accounts receivable aging and to follow up on past due accounts 
we evaluate the credit position of new customers in advance of the initial sale and we evaluate our existing customers credit positions on an ongoing basis 
we will revise credit terms offered to our customers as conditions warrant in order to minimize our exposures 
credit terms may vary by country based upon local customary practice and competition 
billings for precious metals tend to have tighter payment terms than billings for other products 
advance billings are used from time to time to help reduce credit exposures and speed up the collection of cash 
the accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  or  lower than the receivable balance of million at december  the receivable balance declined despite sales in the fourth quarter being higher than sales in the fourth quarter due to an improvement in the collection period 
other receivables were a balance of million as of december  compared to million as of december  the majority of the amounts due at both year ends were for reimbursement for equipment purchased under a government contract 
these billings are typically paid by the government on a current basis 
the other receivable balance at year end also included a million advance of a legal settlement for which we were reimbursed in full by our insurance provider in the first quarter inventories totaled million as of year end compared to million as of year end while inventories increased million  or  during  largely due to the significantly higher level of business  inventory turns  a measure of how efficiently inventory is utilized  improved as of year end as compared to year end inventories within performance alloys accounted for the majority of the increase in total inventories 
inventory pounds on hand were higher at year end than at year end while pounds shipped increased year over year with feedstocks and work in process growing more than finished goods 
despite the high level of sales growth in advanced material technologies in over  inventories only increased approximately as a large portion of this segment s metal requirements are maintained on a consigned basis 
the acquisition of academy added only million to the year end inventory balance 
technical materials inventory increased approximately in order to support the increased business levels in inventories within beryllium and composites also increased to support the higher sales volumes with the majority of this increase occurring in the second half of due to the timing of purchases of input materials 
inventories declined million  or  in inventory turns improved as of year end as compared to year end this improvement occurred primarily in the second half of the year as inventory positions were held fairly constant while sales increased 
the majority of the inventory reduction in was within the performance alloys segment as inventory was adjusted to the lower business levels 
their total pounds in inventory were down from year end  with the finished goods inventories being reduced further than raw materials and work in process due in part to mild changes in distribution channels 
inventories within technical 
table of contents materials declined over the course of  but started to climb in the fourth quarter in response to the improved order entry at that time and their year end inventory was down approximately from year end inventories as of year end within advanced material technologies were essentially unchanged from the prior year end as various reductions from the existing facilities were offset by the inventory acquired with barr 
beryllium and composites inventory was also relatively unchanged in raw material prices increased dramatically in the impact of changing prices on our inventory value is minimized by the use of the last in  first out costing method  which results in the current cost being charged to the income statement and the older costs being used to value the inventory on hand 
see critical accounting policies below 
in addition  a portion of our metal requirements are maintained under off balance sheet consignment arrangements 
the metal is not purchased out of consignment until it is being shipped to the customer 
intangible assets of million as of year end were million lower than the million balance as of year end intangible assets increased million during we acquired intangible assets totaling million during  including million acquired with academy  and million in  largely due to the purchase of barr 
amortization expense was million in and million in see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued salaries and wages were million at the end of compared to million at the end of the balance was million lower than the balance as of year end the differences in the balances between years were due to changes in the incentive compensation accruals  manpower levels  including the impact of the two acquisitions  and other related factors 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities were million as of year end versus million as of year end the predominate cause for this increase was the recording of the long term portion of a month  million capital lease for the building associated with the new beryllium facility being constructed at the elmore plant site 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in the estimated fair value of the earn out liability for the potential payments to be made to the sellers of barr 
other long term liabilities increased million in  largely due to liabilities totaling million assumed with the purchase of barr  including the earn out  and other minor changes net of a million decline in the legal reserve that resulted from a settlement and other changes to the outstanding cases 
retirement and post employment benefits the long term retirement and post employment benefit obligation of million at december  was relatively unchanged from the balance of million at december  included within these balances is the recorded liability for the domestic defined benefit pension plan of million as of year end and million as of year end this plan  which covers the majority of our domestic employees  had a projected benefit obligation of million at year end and million as of year end the main causes for the increase in the obligation were the current year expense and actuarial losses offset in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity 
these actuarial losses were primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate as of december  the market value of the plan assets was million at year end  an increase of million for the year as a result of investment earnings of million and contributions of million less benefit payments and expenses of million 
a portion of our domestic retirees and current employees are eligible to participate in a retiree medical benefit plan 
the liability for this unfunded plan was million as of december  and million as of december  the plan expense was million in and million in our subsidiary in germany has an unfunded retirement plan for its employees while our subsidiary in england has a funded retirement plan 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our retirement obligations 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation  amortization and depletion was million in  million in and million in the majority of the increase in over was due to the acquisitions of barr and academy and the additional depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired 
the decline in from was due to reduced mine amortization at our utah operations 
capital expenditures a summary of capital expenditures over the to timeframe is as follows millions capital expenditures mine development subtotal reimbursement for spending under government contract net spending we have a contract with the us department of defense dod for the design and development of a new facility for the production of primary beryllium 
the total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately million  we will contribute land  buildings  research and development  technology and ongoing operations valued at approximately million to the project 
the dod will reimburse us for the balance of the project cost 
reimbursements from the dod are recorded as unearned income on the consolidated balance sheets 
the new facility is being constructed on our elmore plant site 
construction of the building was completed in while the equipment was nearing completion by year end 
we anticipate that the equipment will be placed in service in the first half of the million of capital expenditures in included million of spending on this project 
since  all of our metallic beryllium requirements have been supplied from materials purchased from the national defense stockpile and international vendors 
successful completion of this project will allow for the creation of the only domestic facility capable of producing primary beryllium 
advanced material technologies capital spending totaled million in  a slight increase over spending of million in spending by this unit totaled million in spending in included a clean room and other equipment upgrades in buffalo  new equipment at both barr and academy and other small projects throughout the organization 
capital spending by performance alloys was million in versus million in and million in these totals include mine development costs of million in  million in and million in the new pit was completed in and we began extracting ore from this pit in the fourth quarter the majority of the segment s remaining capital spending in was on discrete pieces of equipment used in the manufacture of strip and bulk products as well as other infra structure projects at elmore 
spending in was reduced from the level due to the large operating loss in in addition to the new beryllium plant  capital spending within the beryllium and composites segment included spending for a new milling center and inspection unit in capital projects within technical materials in included a new clad brushing machine  a cleaning line and upgrades to various furnaces and other equipment 
spending within this segment was limited to high priority items in due to the decline in profitability 
we also continued work on software upgrades and implementations at various facilities throughout capacity expansion projects  primarily the new beryllium facility  accounted for approximately of the capital spending in approximately of the spending was for maintenance capital projects while mine development costs were of the total spending 
new technology projects accounted for the balance of the capital spending in 
table of contents acquisitions in addition to the above capital expenditures  we acquired the following businesses in the to time frame acquired millions year cost goodwill academy corporation barr associates  inc techni met  inc the academy acquisition cost is shown net of million we received back from the sellers in subsequent to the purchase as a result of the resolution of valuation adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement 
the techni met acquisition cost is shown net of million we received back from escrow in the first quarter as the final purchase price adjustment under the terms of that agreement 
each of these three acquisitions was financed with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the value of the assigned goodwill from each transaction was determined with the assistance of independent valuation experts 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
debt total outstanding debt of million at december  was an increase of million over the million outstanding as of december  the majority of this increase occurred in the first quarter as a result of funding a portion of the acquisition of academy and an increase in working capital 
short term debt  which included us dollar  metal and foreign currency denominated borrowings  totaled million while long term debt totaled million as of year end total debt increased million during after declining million over the first three quarters of as a result of the cash flow from operations  debt increased million in the fourth quarter in order to partially fund the acquisition of barr 
we have a million revolving credit agreement that matures in the fourth quarter it is a committed facility and is comprised of sub facilities for revolving loans  swing line loans  letters of credit and foreign currency denominated borrowings 
the agreement is subject to a maximum availability calculation 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  shareholders equity shareholders equity of million as of year end was million higher than the balance of million as of year end equity declined million in comprehensive income  which includes net income loss  changes in derivative fair values and the adjustment to the pension and other post employment benefit liability that are charged directly to equity and the change in the cumulative translation adjustment  was million in in  we recorded a comprehensive loss of million 
we received million from the exercise of approximately  options in and million from the exercise of approximately  options in we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of million in under a share buyback program initially authorized by our board of directors in we did not repurchase any shares under this plan in equity was also affected by stock based compensation expense  the tax benefits on stock compensation realization and other factors in both and off balance sheet obligations we maintain the majority of the precious metals we use in production on a consignment basis in order to reduce our exposure to metal price movements and to reduce our working capital investment 
in  we began consigning a portion of our copper requirements as well 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the notional value of the off balance sheet inventory was million as of year end compared to million as of year end this increase was caused by a combination of significantly higher metal prices and higher quantities of metal on hand 
the increased quantity was due to improved business conditions  the 
table of contents acquisition of academy and inclusion of their requirements under the consignment lines and the addition of copper under the lines in we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the consignment agreements as of december  contractual obligations a summary of payments to be made under long term debt agreements  operating leases and significant capital leases  pension plan contributions and material purchase commitments by year is as follows millions thereafter total long term debt non cancelable lease payments capital lease payments pension plan contribution purchase commitments total the long term debt repayment in represents the amounts borrowed under the revolving credit agreement as of year end this agreement matures in we anticipate that we will renegotiate a new agreement prior to the maturation date as we have done with previous agreements  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into a replacement facility with similar terms as the existing facility 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement classified as short term debt totaled million as of december  see note f to the consolidated financial statements for additional debt information 
the non cancelable lease payments represent payments under operating leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year as of december  the capital lease payments include the building for the new beryllium facility at the elmore site and other material capital leases 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further leasing details 
the pension plan contribution of million in the above table represents our best estimate of the required contribution to the domestic defined benefit plan as of early in contributions to the plan are designed to comply with erisa guidelines  which change from time to time  and are based upon the plan s funded ratio  which is affected by actuarial assumptions  investment performance  benefit payouts  plan expenses  amendments and other factors 
therefore  it is not practical to estimate contributions to the plan beyond one year 
the purchase commitments of million are for capital equipment to be acquired in based on orders placed as of december  liquidity we believe that cash flow from operations plus the available borrowing capacity and the current cash balance are adequate to support operating requirements  capital expenditures  projected pension plan contributions  environmental remediation projects and strategic acquisitions 
the cumulative cash flow provided from operations totaled million in through  while capital expenditures  net of amounts reimbursed by the government  totaled million 
a summary of key data relative to our liquidity  including the outstanding debt  cash balances and available borrowing capacity  as of the end of each of the last three years is as follows december  millions total outstanding debt cash debt net of cash available borrowing capacity 
table of contents debt net of cash is a non gaap measure 
we are providing this information because we believe it is more indicative of our overall financial position 
it is also a measure our management uses to assess financing and other decisions 
as the chart indicates  debt net of cash increased million from the end of to the end of during these two years  we acquired barr for million and academy for million 
we also made contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan totaling million in these two years 
the increase in debt was less than these net outlays as a result of the cash flow from operations being in excess of capital spending 
the available borrowing capacity in the chart represents the amounts that could be borrowed under the revolving credit agreement and other secured lines existing as of december of each year depicted 
the applicable debt covenants have been taken into account when determining the available borrowing capacity 
one of these covenants restricts the borrowing capacity to a multiple of the twelve month trailing earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and other adjustments 
the improvement in our earnings in over has allowed for the available borrowing capacity to increase  despite the additional debt outstanding 
conversely  the operating loss in reduced the available borrowing capacity as of year end from the year end level 
as of early in the first quarter  we do not know of any future or pending changes that will cause us to be in non compliance with any of our debt covenants in the near term 
the debt to total debt plus equity ratio  a measure of balance sheet leverage  was as of december   as of december  and as of december  the increases in and were largely due to the additional borrowings to finance portions of the academy and barr acquisitions 
management believes that this level of leverage is within the long term average for the company 
there are no mandatory long term debt repayments due in the unused and available capacity under the consignment lines totaled approximately million as of year end the working capital ratio  which compares current assets excluding cash to current liabilities excluding debt  was to as of year end versus to as of year end cash on hand does not affect the covenants or the borrowing capacity under our debt agreements 
portions of the cash balances may be invested in high quality  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less 
in july  our board of directors re authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which represents approximately of our outstanding shares 
the primary purpose of this program is to offset the dilution created through shares issued under stock based compensation plans 
any stock repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in the open market or otherwise  including without limitation  in privately negotiated transactions and round lot or block transactions on the new york stock exchange  and may be made pursuant to accelerated share repurchases or rule b plans 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
environmental we have an active environmental compliance program 
we estimate the probable cost of identified environmental remediation projects and establish reserves accordingly 
the environmental remediation reserve balance was million at december  and million at december  payments against the reserve totaled million in and million in spending in both years included clean up costs for the company s former headquarters building that previously was also used to house light manufacturing operations and r d laboratories as well as other small remediation projects 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
ore reserves we have proven and probable reserves of beryllium bearing bertrandite ore in juab county  utah 
proven reserves are the measured quantities of ore commercially recoverable through the open pit method 
probable reserves are the estimated quantities of ore known to exist but have been computed from inspection sites that are farther apart than those used to measure proven reserves 
although the inspection sites are fewer  assurance levels are sufficient to assume ore continuity 
ore dilution of approximately seven percent occurs during the mining 
table of contents process 
the ore is processed at our extraction facility in utah 
approximately of the beryllium in ore is recovered in the extraction process 
we own approximately of the proven reserves  with the remaining reserves leased 
we augment our proven reserves of bertrandite ore through the purchase of imported beryl ore 
this ore  which is approximately beryllium  is also processed at the utah facility 
we use computer models to estimate ore reserves  which are subject to economic and physical evaluation 
the requirement that reserves pass an economic test causes open pit mineable ore to be found in both proven and probable geologic settings 
proven reserves have decreased slightly in each of the last four years while probable reserves have remained unchanged over the same time period 
based upon average production levels in recent years  proven reserves would last over one hundred years 
ore reserves classified as possible are excluded from the following table 
proven bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium probable bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium bertrandite ore processed thousands of dry tons  diluted grade beryllium  diluted critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the inherent use of estimates and management s judgment in establishing those estimates 
the following are the most significant accounting policies we use that rely upon management s judgment 
accrued liabilities 
we have various accruals on our balance sheet that are based in part upon management s judgment  including accruals for litigation  environmental remediation and workers compensation costs 
we establish accrual balances at the best estimate determined by a review of the available facts and trends by management and independent advisors and specialists as appropriate 
absent a best estimate  the accrual is established at the low end of the estimated reasonable range in accordance with accounting guidelines 
litigation and environmental accruals are established only for identified and or asserted claims  future claims  therefore  could give rise to increases to the accruals 
the accruals are adjusted as facts and circumstances change 
the accruals may also be adjusted for changes in our strategies or regulatory requirements 
since these accruals are estimates  the ultimate resolution may be greater or less than the established accrual balance for a variety of reasons  including court decisions  additional discovery  inflation levels  cost control efforts and resolution of similar cases 
changes to the accruals would then result in an additional charge or credit to income in the period when the change was made 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
legal claims may be subject to partial or complete insurance recovery 
the accrued liability is recorded at the gross amount of the estimated cost and the insurance recoverable  if any  is recorded as an asset and is not netted against the liability 
the accrued legal liability includes the estimated indemnity cost only  if any  to resolve the claim through a settlement or court verdict 
the legal defense costs are not included in the accrual and are expensed in the period incurred  with the level of expense in a given year affected by the number and types of claims we are actively defending 
non employee claims for beryllium disease made prior to where any of the alleged exposure period is prior to year end are covered by insurance 
the insurance covers defense costs and indemnity payments resulting from settlements or court verdicts  subject to a million annual deductible 
in  defense and indemnity costs were less than the deductible 
pensions 
we have a defined benefit pension plan that covers a large portion of our current and former domestic employees 
carrying values of the associated pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using numerous actuarial and financial assumptions 
differences between the assumptions and current period 
table of contents actual results are typically deferred into the net pension asset or liability value and amortized against future income under established guidelines 
the deferral process generally reduces the volatility of the recognized net pension asset or liability and current period income or expense 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded in oci 
the plan liability for accounting purposes was million as of december  management annually reviews key pension plan assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate and the average wage rate increase  against actual results  trends  company strategies  the current and projected investment environment and industry standards and makes adjustments accordingly 
the actuaries adjust certain assumptions to reflect changes in demographics and other factors  including mortality rates and employee turnover  annually as warranted 
these adjustments may then lead to a higher or lower expense in future periods 
we establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality  fixed income investments 
an increase to the discount rate would reduce the present value of the projected benefit obligation and future pension expense and  conversely  a lower discount rate would raise the benefit obligation and future pension expense 
we elected to use a discount rate of as of december  and as of december  our pension plan investment strategies are governed by a policy adopted by the board of directors 
management uses a group of outside investment analysts and brokerage firms to implement these strategies 
the future return on pension assets is dependent upon the plan s asset allocation  which changes from time to time  and the performance of the underlying investments 
as a result of our review of various factors  we reduced the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to as of december  from an assumption of as of december  the plan investments generated a return in excess of the in both and after incurring a significant loss in however  the expected rate of return assumption relates to the long term and given changes in risk assumptions  projections of future returns by type of investment and other factors  we believe that an return over the long term is a reasonable assumption 
should the assets earn an average return less than over time  in all likelihood the future pension expense would increase 
investment earnings in excess of would tend to reduce the future expense 
the impact on the pension expense of a change in discount rate or expected rate of return assumption can vary from year to year depending upon the undiscounted liability level  the current discount rate  the asset balance  other changes to the plan and other factors 
if the december  discount rate were reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  then the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the expected rate of return assumption was reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 
based upon current assumptions  guidelines and estimates  we project the required cash contribution to be made to the plan will be million in additional contributions may be made during based upon a number of factors  including the performance of the plan investments  the discount rate environment  the company s operating performance  the availability of excess cash and borrowing rates under available credit lines 
the pension liability is recalculated at the measurement date december of each year and any adjustments to this account and oci will be recorded at that time accordingly 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our pension and other retirement plans 
lifo inventory 
the prices of certain major raw materials that we use  including copper  nickel  gold  silver and other precious metals  fluctuate during a given year 
overall prices on average were higher in than in where possible  such changes in material costs are generally reflected in selling price adjustments  particularly with precious metals and copper 
the prices of labor and other factors of production  including supplies and utilities  generally increase with inflation 
portions of these cost increases may be offset by manufacturing improvements and other efficiencies 
from time to time  we will revise our billing practices to include an energy surcharge in attempts to recover a portion of our higher energy costs from our customers 
however  market factors  alternative materials and competitive pricing may limit our ability to offset all cost increases with higher prices 
we use the lifo method for costing the majority of our domestic inventories 
under the lifo method  inflationary cost increases are charged against the current cost of goods sold in order to more closely match the cost with the associated revenue 
the carrying value of the inventory is based upon older costs and  as a result  the lifo 
table of contents cost of the inventory on the balance sheet is typically  but not always  lower than it would be under most alternative costing methods 
the lifo cost may also be lower than the current replacement cost of the inventory 
the lifo inventory value tends to be less volatile during years of fluctuating costs than the inventory value would be using other costing methods 
the lifo impact on the income statement in a given year is dependent upon the inflation rate effect on raw material purchases and manufacturing conversion costs  the level of purchases in a given year and changes in the inventory mix and quantities 
assuming no change in the quantity or mix of inventory from the december  level  a basis point change in the annual inflation rate would cause a million change in the lifo inventory value 
deferred tax assets 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we review the expiration dates of the deferrals against projected income levels to determine if the deferral will or can be realized 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferral will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be established for that item 
certain deferrals do not have an expiration date 
we will also evaluate deferred tax assets for impairment due to cumulative operating losses and record a valuation allowance as warranted 
a valuation allowance may increase tax expense and reduce net income in the period it is recorded 
if a valuation allowance is no longer required  it will reduce tax expense and increase net income in the period that it is reversed 
we had valuation allowances of million associated with state and foreign deferred tax assets as of year end primarily for net operating loss carryforwards 
see note q to the consolidated financial statements for additional deferred tax details 
unearned revenue 
billings to customers in advance of the shipment of the goods are initially recorded as unearned revenue  which is a liability on the balance sheet 
this liability is subsequently reversed when the revenue is recognized 
revenue and the related cost of sales and gross margin are only recognized for these transactions when the goods are shipped  title passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
the related inventory also remains on our balance sheet until these revenue recognition criteria are met 
advanced billings are typically made in association with products with long manufacturing times and or products paid with funds from a customer s contract with the government 
billings in advance of the shipments allow us to collect cash earlier than billing at the time of the shipment and  therefore  the collected cash can be used to help finance the underlying inventory 
the unearned revenue balance was million as of year end long term unearned income 
expenditures for capital equipment to be reimbursed under government contracts are recorded in construction in process 
reimbursements for those expenditures are recorded in unearned income  a liability on the balance sheet 
the total cost of the assets to be constructed includes costs reimbursed by the government as well as costs borne by us 
when the assets are placed in service and capitalized  this total cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the assets 
the unearned income liability will be reduced and credited to income ratably with the annual depreciation expense 
this benefit in effect will reduce the net expense charged to the income statement to an amount equal to the depreciation on the portion of the cost of the assets borne by us 
capital expenditures subject to reimbursement from the government under the life of the current dod project and the related unearned income balance totaled million as of december  the project was close to completion as of year end and we anticipate that the equipment will be placed in service in the first half of derivatives 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency  commodity and precious metal price and interest rate exposures 
we apply hedge accounting when an effective hedge relationship can be documented and maintained 
if a cash flow hedge is deemed effective  changes in its fair value are recorded in oci until the underlying hedged item matures 
if a hedge does not qualify as effective  changes in its fair value are recorded against income in the current period 
if a derivative is deemed to be a hedge of the fair value of a balance sheet item  the change in the derivative s value will be recorded in income and will offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item to the extent that the hedge is effective 
we secure derivatives with the intention of hedging existing or forecasted transactions only and do not engage in speculative trading or holding derivatives for investment purposes 
our annual budget  quarterly forecasts and other analyses serve as the basis for determining forecasted transactions 
the use of derivatives is governed by 
table of contents policies established by the board of directors 
these policies provide guidance on the allowable types of hedge contracts  the allowable duration of the contracts and other related matters 
hedge contracts are secured and approved by senior financial managers at our corporate office 
the level of derivatives outstanding may be limited by the availability of credit from financial institutions 
our practice has been to secure hedge contracts denominated in the same manner as the underlying exposure  for example  a yen exposure will only be hedged with a yen contract and not with a surrogate currency 
we also secure contracts through financial institutions that are already part of our bank group

outlook after a record sales year in  we entered with a very healthy backlog and a positive outlook for a number of our markets 
the performance characteristics of our materials make us the supplier of choice for a wide range of applications within the consumer electronics market 
our materials are used in an increasing number of led applications and we anticipate solid growth for these materials in within the medical market  we anticipate that sales will increase to our existing customer base in while we continue to develop products and relationships with other potential customers for long term growth 
we are positioned for growth in the industrial components and commercial aerospace market 
we believe that we can leverage the investments in barr and academy to improve our sales to the key markets they serve 
the solar energy market also remains a long term growth opportunity for a number of our materials 
on the downside  portions of our traditional defense business may be softer in as compared to due to changes in government spending patterns 
a portion of our sales growth in was due to a downstream inventory replenishment  particularly in the consumer electronics market  that may not repeat in the market price for our key raw materials  including gold  silver and copper  was quite high entering and this higher cost may force some customers to turn to alternative lower cost and lower performing materials from other suppliers or defer their purchases from us for a period of time 
we also remain cautious about the economy in general and the impact that the current high unemployment rate and government deficits may have on consumer spending levels and the ability for companies to expand 
as of early in the first quarter  taking into account the above and assuming no change in metal prices  we are expecting that our sales will be higher in than in the profitability from the projected sales growth  however  will be offset to a certain extent by higher costs in these costs include our employee fringe benefit costs will be higher due to medical cost inflation and an increased expense for the domestic defined benefit pension plan as a result of a lower discount rate and other factors  the start up of the new beryllium facility will probably result in various one time inefficiencies as the equipment is tested and brought on stream 
once fully operational  the facility will provide a stable source of high quality metallic beryllium as the current sources are not sufficient to satisfy our needs in the long term 
however  the ongoing unit cost of the material produced by the facility will be higher than our purchase price of beryllium in  and we are undertaking various initiatives  including the corporate rebranding program  designed to improve our efficiencies and profitability in the long term  but the related up front costs may have a negative impact on our earnings in we will have additional legal  administrative and marketing costs associated with changing the name of the company and all of our subsidiaries and to effectively communicate the impact of the rebranding effort to our customers  vendors and shareholders in we will continue our cost control efforts and implement strategies to improve operating efficiencies 
the high raw material costs will keep us focused on improving inventory turns and utilization in order to minimize the inventory on hand  whether owned or consigned 
capital investments will continue to be closely managed and we do not anticipate a significant change in the spending level in from the level excluding spending on the new beryllium plant 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while economic conditions have improved in after the global economic crisis in late and  we remain exposed to changes in economic conditions and the potential impact those changes may have on various facets of our business 
we have a program in place to closely monitor the credit worthiness and financial condition of our key providers of financial services  including our bank group and insurance carriers  as well as the credit worthiness of customers and vendors and have various contingency plans in place 
our credit lines are with banks that remained solvent throughout the crisis 
our total borrowing capacity under secured lines that cannot be terminated prior to maturity as long as we continue to meet our debt covenants was in excess of current needs as of year end we also have metal consignment lines with several institutions 
the capacity under these lines has been expanded over the last two years due to our increased needs and the impact of higher metal prices 
our credit lines for foreign currency hedging purposes have remained in excess of our needs as well 
the financial statement impact from the risk of one or more of the banks in our bank group becoming insolvent cannot be estimated at the present time 
we are exposed to precious metal and commodity price  interest rate  foreign exchange rate and utility cost differences 
while the degree of exposure varies from year to year  our methods and policies designed to manage these exposures have remained fairly consistent 
generally  we attempt to minimize the effects of these exposures through the use of natural hedges  which include pricing strategies  borrowings denominated in the same terms as the exposed asset  off balance sheet arrangements and other methods 
where we cannot use a natural hedge  we may use derivative financial instruments to minimize the effects of these exposures when practical and cost efficient 
the use of derivatives is subject to policies approved by the board of directors with oversight provided by a group of senior financial managers at our corporate office 
we use gold and other precious metals in manufacturing various products 
to reduce the exposure to market price changes  the majority of our precious metal requirements are maintained on a consigned inventory basis 
we purchase the metal out of consignment from our suppliers when it is ready to ship to a customer as a finished product 
our purchase price forms the basis for the price charged to the customer for the precious metal content and  therefore  the current cost is matched to the selling price and the price exposure is minimized 
the use of precious metal consignment arrangements is governed by a policy approved by the board of directors 
we are charged a consignment fee by the financial institutions that own the precious metals 
this fee is partially a function of the market price of the metal 
because of market forces and competition  the fee can only be charged to customers on a case by case basis 
to further limit price and financing rate exposures  under some circumstances we will require customers to furnish their own metal for processing 
customers may also elect to provide their own material for us to process as opposed to purchasing our material 
should the market price of precious metals that we have on consignment increase by from the prices on december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of inventory or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 
the available capacity of our existing credit lines to consign precious metals is a function of the quantity and price of the metals on hand 
as prices increase  as they did in  a given quantity of metal will use a larger proportion of the credit line 
a significant prolonged increase in metal prices could result in our credit lines being fully utilized  and  absent securing additional credit line capacity from a financial institution  could require us to purchase precious metals rather than consign them  require customers to supply their own metal and or force us to turn down additional business opportunities 
if we were in a significant precious metal ownership position  we might elect to use derivative financial instruments to hedge the potential price exposure 
the cost to finance the purchased inventory may also be higher than the consignment fee 
the financial statement impact of the risk from rising metal prices impacting our credit availability cannot be estimated at the present time 
we also use copper in our production processes 
when possible  fluctuations in the purchase price of copper are passed on to customers in the form of price adders or reductions 
while over time our price exposure to copper is generally in balance  there can be a lag between the change in our cost and the pass through to our customers  resulting in higher or lower margins in a given period 

table of contents beginning in  we consigned a portion of our copper inventory requirements 
as with precious metals  the available capacity under the existing lines is a function of the quantity and price of metal on hand 
should the market price of copper increase by from the price as of december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of inventory or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 
in our manufacturing processes  we use ruthenium and other base and precious metals that are not widely used by others or actively traded and  therefore  there is no established efficient market for derivative financial instruments that could be used to effectively hedge the related price exposures 
for certain applications  our pricing practice with respect to these metals is to establish the selling price based upon our cost to purchase the material  limiting our price exposure 
however  the inventory carrying value may be exposed to market fluctuations 
the inventory value is maintained at the lower of cost or market and if the market value were to drop below the carrying value  the inventory would have to be reduced accordingly and a charge taken against cost of sales 
this risk is mainly associated with long manufacturing lead time items and with sludges and scrap materials  which generally have longer processing times to be refined into a usable form for further manufacturing and are typically not covered by specific sales orders from customers 
as a result of market price fluctuations  we recorded lower of cost or market charges totaling million in  million in and million in on portions of our inventory 
the charges were lower in and than in due to the market prices and a reduction in the level of ruthenium containing inventories 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on portions of our debt and cash balances 
this interest rate exposure is managed by maintaining a combination of short term and long term debt and variable and fixed rate instruments 
we may also use interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on variable rate obligations  as we deem appropriate 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding as of december  excess cash is typically invested in high quality instruments that mature in ninety days or less 
investments are made in compliance with policies approved by the board of directors 
assuming no change in the amount or make up of the outstanding debt as of december   a basis point movement upwards in the interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million 
portions of our international operations sell products priced in foreign currencies  mainly the euro and yen  while the majority of these products costs are incurred in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency movements in that if the us dollar strengthens  the translated value of the foreign currency sale and the resulting margin on that sale will be reduced 
we typically cannot increase the price of our products for short term exchange rate movements because of local competition 
to minimize this exposure  we may purchase foreign currency forward contracts  options and collars in compliance with board approved policies 
if the dollar strengthened  the decline in the translated value of our margins would be at least partially offset by a gain on the hedge contract 
a decrease in the value of the dollar would result in larger margins but potentially a loss on the contract  depending upon the method used to hedge the exposure 
the notional value of the outstanding currency contracts was million as of december  if the dollar weakened against the currencies we have hedged from the december  exchange rates  the reduced gain and or increased loss on the outstanding contracts as of december  would reduce pre tax profits by approximately million in this calculation does not take into account the increase in margins as a result of translating foreign currency sales at the more favorable exchange rates  any changes in margins from potential volume fluctuations caused by currency movements or the translation effects on any other foreign currency denominated income statement or balance sheet item 
the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was a net liability of million at december   indicating that the average hedge rates were unfavorable compared to the actual year end market exchange rates 
the cost of natural gas and electricity can vary from year to year and from season to season 
we attempt to minimize these fluctuations and the exposure to higher costs by utilizing fixed price agreements of set durations  when deemed appropriate  obtaining competitive bidding between regional energy suppliers and other methods
