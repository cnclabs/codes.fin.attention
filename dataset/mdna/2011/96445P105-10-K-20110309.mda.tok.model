item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this section is intended to provide an understanding of the financial performance of white river through a discussion of the factors affecting white river s financial condition at december  and  and white river s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and this section should be read in conjunction with white river s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this document 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see discussion of forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
white river believes that the following represents the material critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from estimates 
allowance for loan losses finance receivables provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
the allowance for loan losses is established systematically by management based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
coastal credit reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date 
assumptions regarding probable credit losses are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumptions increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the provision for l oan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations 
coastal credit believes that the existing allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable finance receivable losses 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on white river s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and its ability to avoid an ownership change for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance has been derived pursuant to the provisions of asc topic no 
 income taxes  and reduces the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   there was no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 subsequent events asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  asc provides clarity around the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosure that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the bala nce sheet date 
asc is effective for interim and annual financial reporting periods ending after june  and has been applied prospectively 
white river has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial statements are filed 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 consolidation asc 
asc requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest s give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
in addition  asc requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  which was previously only required upon the occurrence of specified events  and requires additional disclosures concerning an enterprise s continuing involvement with variable interest entities 
asc is effective for annual periods beginning after november   which is january  for white river  and interim periods within that annual reporting period 
adoption did not have an impact on white river s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance became effective with the reporting period beginning january   except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level fair value measu rements  which will become effective with fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
other than requiring additional disclosures  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july new authoritative accounting guidance under asc topic no 
 receivables asc  amended prior guidance to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of loans and leases and the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance 
the new authoritative guidance also requires additional disclosures related to credit quality indicators  past due information  and information related to loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
the new authoritative guidance amends only the disclosure requirements for loans and leases and the allowance 
white river adopted the period end disclosures provisions of the new authoritative guidance under asc in the reporting period en ding december  adoption of the new guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in january   the disclosures regarding troubled debt restructuring activity was temporarily deferred and will be effective for reporting periods after january   and will have no impact on the white river consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to a decrease of million and million in provision for loan losses and other operating expense  respectively  during this decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of million

coastal credit interest on receivables increased million 
this increase is a result of an increase in the coastal credit average finance receivable balance to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  interest on receivables from uac declined million due to a decline in the average receivable balance to approximately  during the year ended december  from approximately  during the year ended december  as a result of the liquidation of finance receivables 
the uac finance receivable portfolio has been fully liquidated as of december  uac will no longer generate interest income from finance receivables 
accretion and other interest decreased to approximately  compared to approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a decrease in accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income 
accumulated other comprehensive income was fully accreted into income in the individual components of accretion and other interest income are shown in the following table in thousands years ended december  uac discount accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income interest on cash balances accretion and other interest income interest expense was unchanged at million for the years ended december  and coastal credit interest expense was million for the years ended december  and the average line of credit was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
uac interest expense was relatively unchanged at million 
provision for loan losses was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring coastal credit s allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
uac recorded a recovery of million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change in the recovery is a result of declining defaulted receivables during and salaries and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of performance based awards in addition to an increase in stock based compensation as a result of awards during other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit operating expenses remained relatively unchanged between these periods 
corporate and other operating expenses decreased million between these periods 
this decrease was primarily the result of the severance payment related to the departure of an executive officer of white river on august  and the expense of approximately  of equity related costs associated with the terminated merger transaction with first chicago bancorp  which expenses occurred during but not in the equity related costs had been recognized as prepaid expenses prior to being expensed 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the expense is based on the estimated effective tax rates for and  respectively 
financial condition as of december  and finance receivables  net finance receivables  net increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the finance receivables  net reflect the balances at coastal credit 
the uac finance receivable portfolio was fully liquidated during and was approximately  at december  a significant number of contracts acquired by coastal credit are contracts made with borrowers who are in the united states military 
as of december   of the coastal credit receivables were with borrowers who are in the united states military as compared to as of december  coastal credit believes that having in the portfolio a significant percentage of contracts for which the borrowers are united states military personnel contributes to lower payment delinquency and greater collection personnel efficiencies 
coastal credit requests that all borrowers who are in the military use the military allotment system to make payments on their contracts 
under this allotment system  the borrower authorizes the military to make a payroll deduction for the amount of the borrower s monthly contract payment and to dir ect this deduction payment to coastal credit on behalf of the borrower 
delinquency of payments on contracts paid by allotment historically has been less than delinquency of payments on contracts not paid by allotment 
as a result  the collection effort associated with the military contracts requires substantially less time  allowing coastal credit s collection staff to focus on non military contracts 
accrued interest payable accrued interest payable was million at december  and creditor notes payable creditor notes payable was approximately  at december  at december   uac s creditor notes payable had no carrying value 
uac will use its remaining cash to complete the wind down of it business and any cash remaining will be paid to the holders of uac s third party creditor notes payable 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily a result of the increase in interest on receivables from coastal credit 
the reduction of other operating expenses from corporate and other related to the severance payment paid in connection with the departure of an executive officer of white river on august  and the expense of approximately  of equity related costs associated with the terminated merger transaction with first chicago bancorp  which expenses occurred during but not in also contributed to this change 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of the increase in finance receivables acquired by coastal credit during compared to net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million repurchase of white river common stock and million of cash dividends paid 
this activity was partially offset by a net increase in the average balance outstanding under the line of credit of million 
net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million repurchase of white river common stock and million of cash dividends paid 
at december   white river and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december coastal credit has a revolving credit facility from a lending institution with a maximum borrowing limit at december  of million 
the maturity date on the line of credit is december  and the interest rate is the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus 
as of december   coastal credit had million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility as compared to million as of december  total availability under the line of credit at december  was million based upon the level of eligible collateral  with million available in excess of the amount utilized at december  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of coastal credit

finance receivables coastal credit delinquency experience of finance receivables at coastal credit  including unearned interest in thousands december  finance receivables gross balance delinquencies days days days total delinquencies as a result of the nature of the customers in coastal credit s portfolio  coastal credit considers the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses to be critical to its financial results 
coastal credit has an allowance for loan losses that is calculated independent of the aggregate acquisition discounts and fees on finance receivables 
coastal credit s allowance for loan losses is based upon the historical rate at which current loans  contracts in a  and day delinquency state and loans ineligible for its borrowing line  have defaulted 
these historical rates are evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis for current conditions

we believe white river is well positioned to continue operations and grow the company responsibly based on the following factors coastal credit is not dependent on the securitization market for financing 
at december   there was million available  in excess of the amount utilized  from the line of credit  which does not expire until december white river is well capitalized with an equity to asset ratio of as of december  while there is never any guarantee white river will not be faced with the constrained financing scenarios seen by other auto finance companies during and since the recession  we believe white river is well positioned in this uncertain economic environment  and we expect to be able to fund normal business operations and meet our general liquidity needs for the next months through access to the line of credit  cash flows from operations  and our other funding sources 
in addition  on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act includes provisions affecting large and small financial industry participants alike  including several provisions that will profoundly affect how certain companies providing consumer financial products and services  such as coastal credit  will be regulated in the future 
among other things  the dodd frank act establishes the bureau of consumer financial protection as an independent entity within the federal reserve  which will be given the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial s ervices or products  including non bank commercial companies in the business of extending credit and servicing consumer loans 
the dodd frank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial industry participants of all types  many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
consequently  the dodd frank act is likely to affect our cost of doing business  it may limit or expand our permissible activities  and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions and non bank commercial companies  including as a result of the dodd frank act  is very unpredictable at this time 
the company s management continues to actively review the provisions of the dodd frank act and assess its probable impact on the business  financial condition  and results of operations of the company 
however  the ultimate effect of th e dodd frank act on the financial services industry in general  and the company in particular  is uncertain at this time

statements that are not historical in nature  including those containing words such as anticipate  estimate  should  expect  believe  intend  and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we caution you to be aware of the speculative nature of forward looking statements 
although these statements reflect white river s good faith belief based on current expectations  estimates and projections about a mong other things the industry and the markets in which white river operates  they are not guarantees of future performance 
whether actual results will conform to management s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties discussed in this annual report on form k  general economic  market  or business conditions  changes in economic variables  such as the availability of business and consumer credit  conditions in the housing market  energy costs  the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings  the rate of unemployment and the levels of consumer confidence and consumer debt  changes in interest rates  the cost of funds  and demand for white river s financial services  the level and volatility of equity prices  commodity prices  currency values  investments  and other market fluctuations and other market indices  changes in white river s competitive position  white river s ability to manage growth  the opportunities that may be presented to and pursued by white river  competitive actions by other companies  changes in laws or regulations  including the impact of current  pending and future legislation and regulations  including the impact of recently enacted federal economic and financial markets recovery legislation and comprehensive financial system regulatory reform legislation  changes in the policies of federal or state regulators and agencies  and other circumstances  many of which are beyond white river s control 
consequently  all of white river s forward looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements
