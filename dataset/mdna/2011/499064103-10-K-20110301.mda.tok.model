introduction business overview we are a provider of multiple truckload transportation services with a nationwide network of service centers through which we operate one of the country s largest tractor fleets  in addition to partnering with third party equipment providers to provide truckload capacity and a broad range of solutions to truckload shippers 
our services include dry van truckload  temperature controlled truckload  dedicated customer services  drayage services between ocean ports or rail ramps and shipping docks  and rail intermodal services 
through our asset based and non asset based capabilities we are able to transport  or can arrange for the transportation of  general commodities for customers throughout the united states 
our operating strategy for our asset based activities to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system and tightly control costs contributed to our return to double digit revenue and earnings growth in in  we also benefited from an improving freight market  as industry wide freight tonnage increased and industry wide trucking capacity remained constrained 
the main factors that affect our results are the number of tractors we operate  our revenue per tractor which includes primarily our revenue per total mile and our number of miles per tractor  the freight volumes brokered to third party equipment providers  and our ability to control our costs 
operating and growth strategy our operating strategy includes the following important elements regional operations 
while our corporate headquarters is in phoenix  arizona  our operations are decentralized and handled in our service centers located throughout the country 
we believe that regional operations offer several advantages  including obtaining greater freight volumes  because a significant portion of truckload freight moves in short to medium lengths of haul  achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high density freight lanes to minimize non revenue miles  enhancing safety and driver recruitment and retention by allowing our drivers to travel familiar routes and return home more frequently  and enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers 

table of contents operating efficiencies 
our company was founded on a philosophy of maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus on operating in particular geographical markets 
this approach allows us to concentrate our marketing efforts to achieve higher penetration of our targeted service areas 
we maintain a modern tractor and trailer fleet in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain drivers 
a generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts supplies 
we also regulate vehicle speed in order to maximize fuel efficiency  reduce wear and tear  and enhance safety 
customer service 
we offer a high level of service to our customers  and we seek to establish ourselves as a preferred truckload solutions provider for our customers 
we provide truckload capacity for customers in high density lanes where we can provide them with a high level of service 
our services include multiple stop pick ups and deliveries  dedicated equipment and personnel  on time pickups and deliveries within narrow time frames  specialized driver training  and other services 
we price our services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and the conditions in market demand 
by providing customers a high level of service  we believe we avoid competing solely on the basis of price 
using technology that enhances our business 
we purchase and deploy technology when we believe that it will allow us to operate more safely  securely  and efficiently and the investment is cost justified 
we use a satellite based tracking and communication system to communicate with our drivers  to obtain load position updates  to manage our fleets  and to provide our customers with freight visibility 
we have installed qualcomm satellite based tracking technology in substantially all of our tractors  which allows us to rapidly respond to customer needs and facilitates efficient communications between our drivers and service centers 
the majority of our trailers are equipped with veriwise trailer tracking technology that allows us to more effectively manage our trailers 
we hav e automated many of our back office functions  and we continue to invest in technology where it allows us to better serve our customers and improve efficiency 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
the most significant expenses in our business include fuel  driver related expenses such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and depreciation of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and service centers and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
since our inception an important element of our asset based operating model has been an extreme focus on our cost per mile 
we intend to carry this focus with us as we expand service offerings  grow existing service centers  and make selective acquisitions 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows total revenue  including fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  net income attributable to knight increased  to million from million  and net income attributable to knight per diluted share increased to from 

table of contents we began to experience signs of economic recovery in the freight market in the fourth quarter of favorable freight demand continued into while freight demand remained consistent throughout most of the year  demand for freight peaked in june in  we operated an average  tractors  an increase of tractors from a year ago 
we finished the year with  tractors in the fleet  up tractors from equipment productivity  as measured by average revenue before fuel surcharge per tractor  increased in the improvement in our equipment productivity was attributable to improvements in our freight mix and contract pricing resulting from favorable trends in a recovering truckload freight market and a improvement in our non paid empty miles 
our average length of haul increased to miles in from miles in miles per tractor increased overall for the year  while miles per tractor decreased in fourth quarter of in comparison to the same quarter a year ago 
non paid empty miles were for  compared to for during  our cash and short term investment balance decreased million  after returning million to our shareholders in the form of quarterly and special cash dividends 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  no debt  and shareholders equity attributable to knight of million 
in  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for capital expenditures net of equipment sales 
since inception we have been profitable through multiple economic cycles 
we view these cycles as opportunities to gain market share from other competitors that do not have the financial staying power to survive the cycles 
these cycles also provide valuable experience to our managers that will help us develop the leaders to grow this business profitably 
our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
see off balance sheet transactions below for a description of our off balance sheet transactions 
trends and outlook during the past few years  we have undertaken an extensive examination of our customers truckload transportation needs  their various transportation modes  the role of truckload freight  and the services we believe we can provide while generating meaningful returns for our shareholders 
we have created a service network with financial accountability  a modern equipment fleet  and the capability of serving truckload customers in every major metropolitan market in the united states 
we believe our operating strategies are contributing factors to our revenue and earnings growth in a significant percentage of our growth in came through less capital intensive operations such as brokerage  intermodal  drayage services  and increasing our independent contractor fleet by approximately tractors  all of which often generate lower margins but favorable returns on investment 
while economic recovery is continuing  freight volumes in the second half of were modest and measurably below the demand experienced in the second quarter of and the demand levels experienced before the economic recession 
we expect the modest volume levels to continue in the near future 
in  we expect truckload freight demand to continue to expand  although rising fuel prices  global political and economic forces  the strength of the dollar against other currencies  and other factors outside our control could affect freight volumes 
we expect that csa  the forthcoming new hours of service rules  and other new regulations will result in a reduction in effective capacity  a negative impact on equipment utilization  and driver shortages 
assuming freight demand is improving  we believe carriers that are well positioned to meet such challenges will have opportunities to increase market share and revenue per mile 
on the cost side  fuel prices have moved significantly higher and are vulnerable to volatility based on events in the middle east and elsewhere 
additionally  revenue equipment and tire prices  as well as driver pay  are expected to increase 
in this environment  it will be critical to allocate equipment to more compensatory shipments  use technology to generate efficiencies  and effectively manage fuel and other costs 
we believe we have the service center network  the modern fleet  the comprehensive truckload services  the management team  the technology  intense focus on cost control  and the capital resources to successfully overcome these challenges and capitalize on any future opportunities 
we will continue to utilize the flexibility of our decentralized model to react and adapt to market conditions 
we are always optimizing our model and refining our execution in reaction to  or in anticipation of  the truckload market dynamics 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and other opportunities that create value for our shareholders and further advance our long term strategy 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue including fuel surcharge revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue equipment lease expense revenue equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation miscellaneous operating expenses miscellaneous operating expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other income net interest and other income income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income net income there are minor rounding differences in the table 
gross fuel expense without fuel surcharge 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in due to rising fuel prices and improvement in our freight mix and contract pricing  our fuel surcharge revenue increased in in from a year ago 
in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe our rel atively high variable costs as a percentage of revenue makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  from million in in  we experienced revenue growth in each of our services 
our revenue growth in was attributable to a improvement in average revenue per total mile  adding average tractors to the average size of our fleet  a improvement in our non paid empty mile  and growth in our brokerage and rail intermodal revenues 
our average freight revenue per tractor per week improved to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in in addition to the improvement in our equipment productivity  we also increased our average length of haul from a year ago 
we ended with  tractors  an increase of tractors from a year ago 
if the economy continues to gradually improve and capacity remain s tight  we anticipate obtaining overall rate increases in and beyond  however  adverse changes in either of these factors would likely prevent rate increases and could negatively impact existing rates 

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in while driver wages rose in  we were able to lower our overall salary and wages as a percent of revenue due to higher revenue per mile and by decreasing the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
at december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  our accrual for workers compensation benefits and stock based compensation expense are components of our salaries  wages and benefit expense 
our expense in this category included a non cash million pre tax million after tax stock compensation charge related to an adjustment to the straight line recognition of expense as prescribed in asc and the accelerated vesting of equity awards under our equity compensation plan as a result of the passing of a senior executive 
we believe that the driver market is tightening and expect the implementation of csa to further reduce the pool of available drivers  which could require us to increase driver pay in accordingly  we expect salaries  wages and benefits expenses to increase going forward in absolute terms and potentially as a percentage of revenue absent an increase in revenue to offset increased costs 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in fuel costs in total dollars increased as us national average diesel fuel price increased more than in our fuel cost as a percentage of revenue improved due to higher fuel surcharge recovery and a increase in the percentage of our fleet miles driven by independent contractors  who buy their own fuel and receive a fuel surcharge payment from us  and an increase in purchased transportation costs paid to third party equipment providers 
our fuel cost also was reduced by million due to a gain from a future swap contract that was settled in the second quarter of we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of our fuel expense 
fuel surcharge revenue was million in  compared to million in operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to in  from in equipment maintenance cost increased as we added more miles to our trucks and due to a modest increase in the average age of our equipment 
these expenses were partially offset by an increase in the percentage of miles driven by independent contractors  who pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to in  compared to in communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at in and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  from in the decrease is due to higher revenue per tractor which more effectively spread this fixed cost  higher equipment utilization  a decrease in the percentage of our fleet comprised of company owned tractors  and increased use of third party carriers 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to a year ago 
these decreases were partially offset by higher equipment prices for epa compliant engines 
over of our company owned tractor fleet are comprised of the us epa or us epa engine 
these engines are documented to provide substantial emissions reductions  and we also believe this investment will contribute to our strategy of maintaining efficiency in our operations by adhering to a relatively consistent trade in schedule 
in  we also have invested in aerodynamic devices to improve trailer aerodynamics which lead to meaningful fuel efficiency improvements 
absent offsetting improvements in revenue per tractor or continued growth in our independent contractor fleet  our expense in this category may increase going forward if equipment prices continue to inflate 
purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage and intermodal operations  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile or per shipment basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended  from for the same period in the increases in this category are primarily due to a increase in the miles operated by independent contractors  as opposed to company drivers  and that demand for broker loads improved in compared to the same period a year ago 
to the extent compensation for independent contractors or third party capacity provid ers increases  truckload demand exceeds capacity additions  fuel prices continue to rise  or competition for independent contractors increases  our purchased transportation expense per mile or load could increase 

table of contents miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of equipment  miscellaneous operating expense would have decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in this decrease is due to our continuous effort to manage our costs coupled with increased revenue that covers certain fixed components of our miscellaneous operating expenses 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for  compared to for we had no outstanding debt at december  or other income in the current year includes a  earn out from our investment in concentrek  which was sold in we also recognized a million gain for the sale of a trp portfolio company whose value had substantially increased since purchase 
however  the gain from the sale was off set by approximately the same amount for an impairment charge in the remaining trp portfolio and the equity loss in our investment in trp iii 
income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for decreased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in due to falling diesel fuel prices in most of the year  our fuel surcharge revenue decreased in compared to in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe our relatively high variable costs as a percentage of revenue makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to million for  from million in we continue to face significant challenges as a result of the weak economic environment 
price competition remained intense as carriers struggled to maintain equipment productivity 
in  we experienced a high level of bid activity  particularly in the first quarter  contributing to a decrease in our average revenue per mile for the year 
supply of truckload equipment continued to outpace demand throughout  and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
declines in both revenue per mile and miles per tractor contributed to a decline in average freight revenue per tractor per week  to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in our non paid empty mile perc ent remained essentially constant at in from in despite the continued challenging truckload freight environment  our load count grew in compared to a year ago 
we ended with  tractors  an increase of tractors from a year ago 
salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in the decrease is due to increased efficiency in our non driver compensation and staffing levels and a decrease in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
at december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in diesel fuel price has been volatile over the past two years 
after reaching unprecedented record high fuel prices during most of  diesel fuel price started to fall in fourth quarter of and continued through the first quarter of the decrease in our fuel expense is due to the combination of lower diesel fuel prices  internal initiatives to improve fuel efficiency  and the decrease in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers versus independent contractors who purchase their own fuel 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a po rtion of our fuel expense 
fuel surcharge revenue was million in  compared to million in declining fuel prices have led to significant decreases in fuel expense and fuel surcharge revenue this year 

table of contents operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in primarily because of a modest increase in fleet age and a decrease in revenue per tractor that less efficiently covered the fixed portion of these costs 
these items more than offset savings in this expense category from the decrease in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers versus the percentage provided by independent contractors  who pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for the reduction in this expense in resulted from lowered insurance accruals  which decreased as a result of reduced crash frequency  severity  and improved claim management practices  including a significant increase in subrogation recovery 
loss frequency and severity continues to be positively affected by our driver training program  which includes smith system training  a widely recognized leader in behind the wheel defensive driving training and recurrent driver training  as well as other internal loss control efforts aimed at reducing crash frequency and severity 
both our loss prevention and claim management practices have been instrumental in lowering insurance and claims expense in we believe that our internal loss control efforts  including smith system training and claim management practices  will continue to yield positive benefits 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to in  compared to in communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to in  compared to in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from in this increase is primarily due to a decrease in revenue and revenue per tractor in the current year 
this was partially offset by the average percentage of our tractor fleet operated by independent contractors who own their own tractors increasing from most of our fleet is late model equipment that consists primarily of tractors equipped with us epa emission compliant engines 
given higher prices for the epa compliant engines  we expect this category may increase going forward  although an improvement in revenue per tractor in a better freight environment could cause this category to increase by a smaller amount  or even decrease  as a percentage of revenue 
our service cen ter network allows us to efficiently maintain this equipment 
in  we plan to continue a similar trade cycle and adopt the even cleaner burning engines that have just become available 
lease expense for revenue equipment was essentially zero in and we did not have any equipment under operating leases as of december  purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile or per shipment basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended  from for the same period in the increase is due to the combination of an increase in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by independent contractors during  and an off setting decrease in payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which experienced a decline as there was less freight to move via brokerage 
while overall brokerage revenue and purchased transportation services fell year over year from to  brokerage revenue increased in fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter a year ago 
at december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  the increase in our independent contractor fleet is primarily from the expansion of our drayage operations 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for 
table of contents net interest and other income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for  compared to for other income in the current year includes a  gain from insurance settlement for damage from a fire to one of our buildings 
we had no outstanding debt at december  or income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the small decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to lower state tax expense resulting from changes in our income allocated to the numerous states in which we operate 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  issuances of our common stock  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase for is primarily due to a million decrease in our short term investments  in comparison to a million increase in our short term investments in we declared and issued a special dividend of per share to our common stock shareholders in the fourth quarter of  requiring us to dispose of a significant portion of short term investments to cover the payment of the dividend 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase is mainly due to an increase in capital expenditures for revenue equipment in capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we also purchased approximately million of marketable equity securities that are classified as available for sale securities in excluding any acquisitions  we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approxima tely million to million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and the increase in cash used in financing activities in is primarily due to a special dividend of per share paid to our common stock shareholders in the fourth quarter of our regular quarterly cash dividend was also increased from per share to per share in the second quarter of total cash dividends paid to our shareholders was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we also spent million and million for the repurchase of our common stock in and  respectively 
we did not repurchase any shares in at december   we had no outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million 
at december   amounts outstanding under the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit agreement and were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as of december  we believe that we will be able to finance our short term needs for working capital over the next months and beyond  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash  cash flows from operations  and the borrowing available under our existing line of credit 
we will have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of available financing  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 

table of contents off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
we did not have any revenue equipment held under operating leases in or vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments with respect to such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts  and using other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounti ng policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from zero to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
we both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than ori ginally expected 
this determination is based upon i market conditions in equipment sales  ii the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii the average miles driven on the equipment being 
table of contents sold 
future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuation in market value that is not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present that indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss 
our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value 
claims accrual 
reserves are established based on estimated or expected losses for claims 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves are adjusted upon review of facts or information that better inform us as to the value of the claim based on numerous factors 
the reserves are analyzed quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse develo pment of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention  we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed our coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  in accordance with asc income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations  and because any deferred assets can be fully offset by deferred liabilities 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management judgment also is required regarding a variety of other factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on our future performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
share based payments 
we have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant 

table of contents the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight line basis  which generally ranges between five to seven years 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
management judgment is required to estimate stock opt ion exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model and management bases such decisions on historical data 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
we have service based restricted stock awards outstanding 
the compensation expense uses fair value recognition provisions of asc under which we estimate the expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  or for which there are no underlying related exposures 
because our operations are mostly confined to the united states  we are not subject to a material amount of foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment or otherwise 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
we did not have any debt outstanding at december   and therefore had no market risk related to debt 
we invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipalities in the us  and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our income from investments may decrease in the future 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can fluctuate due to market factors that are beyond our control 
we believe fuel surcharges are effective at mitigating most  but not all  of the risk of high fuel prices because we do not recover the full amount of fuel price increases 
in may  we entered into a forward future swap contract to hedge million gallons of fuel per month for july through june in june  we accepted a favorable settlement offered by the other party to terminate the contract in exchange for a million payment to us 
the contract was terminated prior to june  as of december   we did not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations  but may use such instruments in the future
