overview we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during and of million gross tons and million gross tons of ferrous materials  respectively  and million pounds and million pounds of nonferrous metals  respectively 
our steel production during and  excluding the techs  was million tons and million tons  respectively 
during  we reported net sales of billion and an operating margin of  as compared to net sales of billion and an operating margin of during  and net sales of billion and an operating margin of during the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products  processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals  and to a lesser degree  fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products 
our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations  metals recycling and ferrous resources operations  and steel fabrication operations 
we achieved record revenues and operating income during  with very strong demand and pricing in each of our operating segments  resulting in strong margins and record operating results 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of and persisting throughout  there were significant declines associated with the global economic slowdown impacting  among other things  non residential construction  residential construction and automobile manufacturing activity  which drove down both our volumes and sales prices  thereby decreasing our total revenues while increasing our per unit cost to convert our raw materials to finished goods 
due to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments required in the first quarter of  we experienced our lowest gross margin percentage results during that quarter with gross margins subsequently trending upward through the remainder of as the economic environment slowly improved and we continued to focus on cost reductions 
during  we continued to experience improved net sales compared to  driven by the general improvement of the domestic economy  resulting in increasing customer demand and pricing for our products 
steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume and pricing  although there was some market volatility during the year 
the most impactful demand improvement in versus was in our sheet and special bar quality steel products as the automotive  transportation  industrial  and agricultural and construction equipment markets showed signs of recovery 
late in the fourth quarter  we experienced increased order entry and pricing in our steel 
table of contents operations  particularly in sheet products 
operating income in our steel operations for was up million  or  compared with that of due to the improved volumes and pricing 
our metals recycling operations experienced improved shipping volumes and pricing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals in  as demand improved due in large part to domestic and international steel production utilization rates increasing as compared to as a result of much stronger metals recycling operations  as well as those of iron dynamics  operating income in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations increased million  to million  compared with the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in  and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january throughout we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations as needed in order to increase production and plant availability 
during  mesabi nugget produced  metric tons of iron nuggets for use by our own steel mills 
during  we anticipate reaching much improved sustainable production levels  moving towards the facility anticipated annual production capacity of  metric tons 
the mesabi nugget start up operating losses excluding noncontrolling interests reduced consolidated pretax earnings by million in versus million in  when the location was being constructed 
outlook looking ahead to  we are optimistic regarding slow but steady growth in the us economy  which could result in increased volumes compared to for both our steel and metals recycling operations 
we expect steel consumption to grow in in the automotive  transportation  energy  industrial  and agricultural and construction equipment sectors 
we believe residential and non residential construction activity has likely reached its bottom 
the fruition of these combined factors should result in an improved operating environment for all our segments in the coming year 
our focus will continue to be on disciplined cost control  revenue optimization  and product growth opportunities  while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain economic environment 
we currently plan to spend less than million in capital investments during we believe our current operations and sources of cash are adequate to meet the cash requirements associated with these possible investments

we saw stronger increases in demand related to our sheet products versus our long products in general during  however  within our long product operations  special bar quality steel demand was especially strong and continues to remain so as agricultural and construction equipment markets continue to improve 
sheet product shipments increased  as average selling prices per ton shipped increased  while long product shipments increased  as average selling prices per ton shipped increased metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per ton consumed in our steel operations increased during  as compared to  and decreased as compared to the peak pricing that occurred during during   and  our metallic raw material costs represented   and  respectively  of our steel operation total manufacturing costs  excluding the operations of the techs  which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes 
the lower relationship of scrap costs to total costs in is due to a decrease of in the cost per ton of metallic raw materials consumed in versus  while conversion and other costs held relatively steady 
gross margins increased per ton during  as compared to  largely due to lower conversion and other costs per ton  as increases in metallic raw materials were offset by improved product prices 
this increased gross margin per ton and the increase in volumes in versus resulted in improved steel segment operating income of million  a increase as compared to  but a decrease of from  when product pricing increases outpaced the increases in metallic raw materials costs

the increased volume and pricing of our ferrous materials is directly impacted by the increase in both domestic steel mill utilization and global steel mill production  since the steel industry is our primary customer 
domestic steel mill utilization increased from for full year to for full year per american iron and steel institute  and global steel mill production increased for full year over full year per world steel association 
ferrous resources 
our ferrous resource operations consist of the revenues and expenses associated with our liquid pig iron facility  idi  our iron nugget manufacturing facility  mesabi nugget  and our potential future mining operations  mesabi mining 
idi primarily produces liquid pig iron  which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division 
the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in  and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january throughout we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations  as needed  in order to increase production and plant availability

during  we anticipate reaching much improved sustainable production levels  moving towards the facility anticipated annual production capacity of  metric tons 
steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations include six operating and two idled new millennium building systems plants located in the midwest  southeastern and southwestern parts of the united states 
revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses  girders  steel joists and steel decking used within the non residential construction industry 
steel fabrication operations accounted for   and of our consolidated net sales  with operating losses of million and million during and  respectively  and operating income of million during net sales for the segment increased million  or  in  compared to as volumes increased in by compared to  but are still well below volumes 
average pricing decreased just slightly overall in compared with  and decreased by compared to the operating loss in includes a non cash impairment charge of million related to our idled south carolina facility 
after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities  we determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at our idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches 
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations 
during   and  the cost of steel products purchased represented   and  respectively  of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations 
the cost of steel increased in as compared to by per ton 
this increase  coupled with a decrease in average selling values  resulted in decreased gross margins during compared to in spite of the recovering economy in  non residential construction remained very weak and did not meaningfully improve from  however  we believe the industry segment has hit its bottom 
we are seeing some encouraging signs emerging for our steel fabrication segment as we have continued to experience slightly positive trends in order entry activity and product pricing  and we anticipate the non residential construction recovery to develop at a slow pace during the october purchase of joist assets from another manufacturer in arkansas  nevada  and northern mexico for million gives us a broader geographic presence in the joist market moving forward  providing us the opportunity to better serve our customers that have a nationwide footprint and gain further market share

table of contents capital resources and long term debt 
during our total outstanding debt increased million to billion  due to our issuance of million of senior notes due in march the net proceeds were used to repay the then outstanding borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility with remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes 
our total long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our long term debt  including current maturities  divided by the sum of our long term debt  redeemable noncontrolling interest and total equity  was at december   and at december  at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
the company million senior secured revolving credit facility due june is secured by substantially all of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of the company wholly owned subsidiaries capital stock  and is subject to a borrowing base 
at the end of each month  the company revolver must be the lesser of million less other applicable commitments  such as letters of credit and other secured debt  as defined within the credit agreement these additional commitments were million at december   or the sum of of the company eligible accounts receivable and of the company eligible inventories  less other applicable commitments  such as letters of credit and other secured debt  as defined within the credit agreement 
at december   the company had million of availability on its senior secured revolver 
our senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with our financial covenants  and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
the financial covenants state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than to from december  through maturity 
our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last twelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and certain other non cash transactions as allowed in our senior secured credit agreement by our ltm gross interest expense 
we must maintain a first lien debt to ltm ebitda ratio of not more than to from december  through maturity 
beginning with the twelve month period ended december   and at all times thereafter  a total debt to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio of not more than to must be maintained 
in addition  if the total debt to ebitda ratio exceeds to at any time  then the ability of the company to make restricted payments  as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases  among other things  is limited to million per quarter 
at december   our interest coverage  first lien debt  and total debt ratios were to  to  and to  respectively

our board of directors  along with executive management  approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis 
the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  outstanding indebtedness  and current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 

table of contents other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow  access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million

contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt purchase obligations construction commitments lease commitments other commitments total the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes and convertible notes remain outstanding until maturity

we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 
we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits  however  due to the uncertainty of the timing  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of million as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately million 
over of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately  at all of our facilities during we have an accrual of million net of million of escrowed funds recorded as a contingency for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and million related to mesabi nugget and mesabi mining 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future  such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
except for our steel fabrication operations segment  we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries  and nonferrous metals  such as copper  brass  aluminum and stainless steel to  among others  ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and mills  smelters  and specialty mills 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventories 
we record inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally on a first in  first out  basis 
impairments of long lived tangible and finite lived intangible assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary  including by way of examples  a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows  significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete  our strategy and capital planning  and the economic climate in markets to be served 
after the purchase of additional fabrications assets in the fourth quarter of and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities  the company determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at its idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined by utilizing market and cost approaches 
the resulting impairment charge of million was recorded within the steel fabrications reporting segment 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
our goodwill relates to various business combinations  and is allocated to the following reporting units at december in thousands omnisource metals recycling ferrous resources segment the techs steel segment roanoke bar division steel segment new millennium building systems steel fabrication segment 
table of contents at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an impairment test for goodwill 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are generally one level below our operating segments 
we utilize a two stepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment 
the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment 
in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows  and assessing its reasonableness by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  we perform the second step of the test  which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded  if any 
in the second step  we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method include a expected cash flows for the five year period following the testing date including market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and estimated capital needs  b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit  and c a discount rate based on management best estimate of the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
management considers historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment  primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition 
consequently  if operating results and or economic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition  it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets 
a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 
our other indefinite lived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december  and in thousands omnisource metals recycling ferrous resources segment the techs steel segment at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount 
the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

table of contents as of our most recent annual impairment reviews  which occurred during the fourth quarter of  we had no significant impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets  individually or in the aggregate 
in addition  as of december   we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term 
however  if economic conditions or our outlook affecting these reporting units change significantly  it is possible that we may experience impairments of some of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets  which would require us to recognize impairment charges 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate principal average rate principal average rate expected maturity date thereafter total fair value 
table of contents commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas  and zinc 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as fuel  zinc  electricity and natural gas and its transportation 
certain commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to months for physical commodity requirements and for up to years for commodity transportation requirements 
our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december are as follows in thousands thereafter we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 
in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals 
our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin  within certain parameters  that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer 
at december   we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of million all of which have a settlement date in we expect the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts to be fully consummated
