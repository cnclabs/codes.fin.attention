item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional  flexible  and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company acquires  develops and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt regions with an emphasis in the states of florida  texas  arizona and california 
the company believes the slowdown in the economy has affected and will continue to affect its operations 
the company has experienced decreases in occupancy and rental rates 
the current economic situation is also impacting lenders  making it more difficult to obtain financing 
loan proceeds as a percentage of property values have decreased  and property values have decreased 
the company believes its current lines of credit provide the capacity to fund the operations of the company for and the company also believes it can issue common and or preferred equity and obtain mortgage financing from insurance companies and financial institutions as evidenced by the closing of a million  non recourse mortgage loan in december  which is described in liquidity and capital resources 
the company s primary revenue is rental income  as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space 
during  leases expired on  square feet of eastgroup s total square footage of  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of the expiring square feet 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year 
during  average rental rates on new and renewal leases decreased by 
property net operating income pnoi from same properties decreased for as compared to eastgroup s total leased percentage was at december  compared to at december  leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis at december  as of february   leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis 
the company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisition and development programs 
during  eastgroup purchased three business distribution complexes with a total of six buildings  square feet and acres of land for a total of million 
the operating properties are located in san diego  square feet  charlotte  square feet  and phoenix  square feet 
the small tract of land is located adjacent to an existing property in tucson and provides additional parking and trailer storage for the property 
eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a contributor to the company s long term growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
eastgroup s development activity has slowed considerably as a result of current market conditions 
the company had two development starts in a  square foot pre leased expansion project in san antonio and a  square foot partially pre leased service center in houston 
during  the company transferred five properties  square feet with aggregate costs of million at the date of transfer from development to real estate properties 
these properties  which were collectively leased as of february   are located in tucson  arizona  houston  texas  and tampa and west palm beach  florida 
during  the company funded its acquisition and development programs through its million lines of credit as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate debt to replace short term bank borrowings 
eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  defined as net income loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excludin g gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts reits 
the major factors influencing pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success de pends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
pnoi is comprised of income from real estate operations  less expenses from real estate operations 
pnoi was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands income from real estate operations expenses from real estate operations property net operating income income from real estate operations is comprised of rental income  pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
expenses from real estate operations are comprised of property taxes  insurance  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees  other operating costs and bad debt expense 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered 
the following table presents reconciliations of net income to pnoi for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands net income equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment interest income other income gain on sales of securities gain on sales of non operating real estate income loss from discontinued operations depreciation and amortization from continuing operations interest expense general and administrative expense other expense property net operating income the company believes ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance for equity reits 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  nor is it a measure of the company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
in addition  ffo  as reported by the company  may not be comparable to ffo by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
 the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents reconciliations of net income available to eastgroup properties  inc common stockholders to ffo for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income available to eastgroup properties  inc 
common stockholders depreciation and amortization from continuing operations depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations depreciation from unconsolidated investment noncontrolling interest depreciation and amortization gain on sales of depreciable real estate investments funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders per diluted share funds from operations available to common stockholders per diluted share diluted shares for earnings per share and funds from operations the company analyzes the following performance trends in evaluating the progress of the company the ffo change per share represents the increase or decrease in ffo per share from the same quarter in the current year compared to the prior year 
ffo per share for the fourth quarter of was 
per share compared with 
per share for the same period of  a decrease of per share 
for the year  ffo was per share compared with per share for  a decrease of per share 
ffo per share for both periods decreased primarily due to a decrease in same property operations and decreases in capitalized interest and capitalized development costs due to a slowdown in the company s development program 
these decreases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense for the fourth quarter and the year 
in addition  for the year  the company s termination fee income was higher in than in same property net operating income change represents the pnoi increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period 
pnoi from same properties decreased for the three months ended december  for the year  pnoi from same properties decreased 
occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced as compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period 
occupancy at december  was

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
the purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further alloca ted to in place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the period in which a property is under development  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
eastgroup curre ntly has the intent and ability to hold its real estate investments and to hold its land inventory for future development 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced  and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge on the consolidated statements of income 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account th at is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge on the consolidated statements of income 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

the interest rate on each tranche is usually reset on a monthly basis and as of december   was libor plus basis points with an annual facility fee of basis points 
the line of credit has an option for a one year extension on the same terms and conditions at the company s request 
at year end  the company had two letters of credit totaling  associated with this line of credit 
these letters reduce the am ount available on the credit facility

the current economic situation is impacting lenders  making it more difficult to obtain financing

the company believes its current lines of credit provide the capacity to fund the operations of the company for and the company also believes it can obtain mortgage financing from insurance companies and financial institutions and issue common equity 
on december   eastgroup closed on a million  non recourse first mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of  a year term and a year amortization schedule 
the loan is secured by properties containing million square feet 
the company used the proceeds of this mortgage loan to pay down million of other mortgage debt and to reduce variable rate bank borrowings 
on october   the company repaid its  mortgage loan on the tower automotive center that had an interest rate of and a maturity date of january  contractual obligations eastgroup s fixed  non cancelable obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands fixed rate debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt variable rate debt obligations interest on variable rate debt   operating lease obligations office leases ground leases real estate property obligations development obligations tenant improvements purchase obligations total these amounts are included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s variable rate debt changes depending on the company s cash needs and  as such  both the principal amounts and the interest rates are subject to variability 
at december   the weighted average interest rate was on the variable rate debt due in january represents an estimate of interest due on variable rate debt based on the outstanding variable rate debt and interest rates on that debt as of december  represents commitments on real estate properties  except for tenant improvement obligations 
represents commitments on properties under development  except for tenant improvement obligations 
represents tenant improvement allowance obligations 
eastgroup had no purchase obligations as of december  the company anticipates that its current cash balance  operating cash flows  borrowings under its lines of credit  proceeds from new mortgage debt and or proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments will be adequate for i operating and administrative expenses  ii normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties  iii debt service obligations  iv maintaining compliance with its debt covenants  v distributions to stockholders  vi capital improvements  vii purchases of properties  viii development  and ix any other normal business activities of the company  both in the short and long term 
inflation and other economic considerations most of the company leases include scheduled rent increases 
additionally  most of the company leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance  thereby reducing the company exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in the event inflation causes increases in the company s general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates  such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
eastgroup financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the company properties are located 
the current economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of the company existing tenants to make lease payments and may therefore increase bad debt expense 
it may also impact the company s ability to i renew leases or re lease space as leases expire  or ii lease development space 
in addition  the economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or decline in rents the company can charge to re lease properties upon expiration of current leases 
in all of these cases  eastgroup s cash flows would be adversely affected
