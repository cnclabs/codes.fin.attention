item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenue for additional disclosure 
other information related to our revenues  income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements  segment reporting 
regulation and other factors overview the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws  regulations and rules including  among others  those related to government healthcare participation requirements  various licensure and accreditations  reimbursement for patient services  health information privacy and security rules  and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse provisions including  but not limited to  federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources  false claims submitted to federal health care programs and self referrals by physicians 
providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs  subjected to significant fines or penalties and or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services 
although we believe our policies  procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations  no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions  or that we would not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties if so subjected 
even if we were to ultimately prevail  a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws  regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us 
licensing  certification and accreditation all of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal  state and local health agencies  as well as the requirements of municipal building codes  health codes and local fire departments 
various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the joint commission 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare and medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
if any of our facilities were to lose its joint commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and medicaid programs  the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs and other payors 
although we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal  state  local and independent review body regulations and standards  please see item a 
risk factors of this report for disclosure regarding ongoing matters with the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the california department of public health in connection with our southwest healthcare system 
the requirements for licensure  certification and accreditation are subject to change and  in order to remain qualified  it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel and services in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on operations 
certificates of need many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures  construction  expansion  modernization or initiation of major new services 
failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition  expansion or replacement  the imposition of civil or  in some cases  criminal sanctions  the inability to receive medicare or medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility s license  which could 
table of contents harm our business 
in addition  significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements 
in the past  we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements  but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations 
conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals to for profit entities 
these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions 
although the level of government involvement varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and  in some cases  approval of a transaction in which a not for profit entity sells a health care facility to a for profit entity 
the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not for profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not for profit hospitals 
utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services 
the law and regulations require peer review organizations pros to review the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges  the quality of care provided  the validity of diagnosis related group drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay 
pros may deny payment for services provided  assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider that is in substantial non compliance with the standards of the pro be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
we have contracted with pros in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews 
audits most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of medicare and medicaid program submitted claims 
if these audits identify overpayments  we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights 
the federal government contracts with third party recovery audit contractors racs and medicaid integrity contractors mics  on a contingent fee basis  to audit the propriety of payments to medicare and medicaid providers 
permanent rac audits were created by section of the tax relief and health care act of and required the secretary to expand the program to all states by no later than similarly  medicare zone program integrity contractors zpics target claims for potential fraud and abuse 
additionally  medicare administrative contractors macs must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers 
we have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years with no material overpayments identified 
however  potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves  and any excess could potentially be substantial 
further  medicare and medicaid regulations also provide for withholding medicare and medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
self referral and anti kickback legislation the stark law the social security act includes a provision commonly known as the stark law 
this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship  unless an exception is met 
these types of referrals are known as self referrals 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to  for each violation  up to  for sham arrangements  up to  for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs 
there are a number of exceptions to the self referral prohibition  including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit  service or subpart 
however  federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities 
there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial 
table of contents arrangements between physicians and providers  including employment contracts  leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
nonetheless  because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the stark law 
anti kickback statute a provision of the social security act known as the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting  receiving  offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using  referring  ordering  recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program 
however  recent changes to the anti kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation  one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti kickback statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law 
the anti kickback statute contains certain exceptions  and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors  from the federal anti kickback statute for various activities 
these activities  which must meet certain requirements  include but are not limited to the following investment interests  space rental  equipment rental  practitioner recruitment  personnel services and management contracts  sale of practice  referral services  warranties  discounts  employees  group purchasing organizations  waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts  managed care arrangements  obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies  investments in group practices  freestanding surgery centers  donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services 
the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
however  such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities 
although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations  there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti kickback statute or other applicable laws 
violations of the anti kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to  for each violation or imprisonment  however  under usc section  this fine may be increased to  for individuals and  for organizations 
civil money penalties may include fines of up to  per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and or exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
similar state laws many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti kickback statute and the stark law  some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure 
in many instances  the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes 
however  in most cases  little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many cases  we don t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation 
it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation 
table of contents could suffer significantly 
in addition  we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted  what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be 
if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities  and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
federal false claims act and similar state regulations a current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act  and  in particular  actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
when a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the false claims act  the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  to  for each separate false claim 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the false claims act  eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention  as well as the receipt  of overpayments 
in addition  recent changes to the anti kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil false claims act 
further  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court 
other fraud and abuse provisions the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid 
false claims include  but are not limited to  billing for services not rendered  billing for services without prescribed documentation  misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud 
like the anti kickback statute  these provisions are very broad 
further  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs  whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs 
hipaa also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare 
there are civil penalties for prohibited conduct  including  but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services 
hipaa administrative simplification and privacy requirements the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa  as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech  require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry 
hipaa also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed 
violations of hipaa can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties 
compliance with the electronic data transmission standards became mandatory in october however  during the following year  hhs agreed to allow providers and other electronic billers to continue to submit pre hipaa format electronic claims for periods after october   provided they can show good faith 
table of contents efforts to become hipaa compliant 
since this exception expired  we believe that we have been in compliance with the electronic data transmission standards 
we were required to comply with the privacy requirements of hipaa by april  we believe that we were in material compliance with the privacy regulations by that date and remain so  as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance 
the hipaa security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality  integrity and availability of patient information 
hitech has since strengthened certain hipaa rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information  extended certain hipaa provisions to business associates  and created new security breach notification requirements 
hitech has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a hipaa violation has occurred 
we were required to comply with the security regulations by april  and believe that we have been in substantial compliance with hipaa and hitech requirements to date 
environmental regulations our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
infectious waste generators  including hospitals  face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste  including civil penalties of up to  per day of noncompliance  criminal penalties of up to  per day  imprisonment  and remedial costs 
in addition  our operations  as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws 
corporate practice of medicine several states  including florida  nevada and texas  have laws and or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  particular providers for medical products and services 
possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable 
these statutes and or regulations vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations 
many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee splitting with physicians 
we do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements 
emtala all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
this federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital s emergency room for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency  to either stabilize the patient s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition 
our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under emtala  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute 
the federal government broadly interprets emtala to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital s emergency room  but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital s campus  generally  or to a hospital based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital owned ambulance  subject to certain exceptions 
emtala does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services  however  cms has recently announced its intent to issue proposed rulemaking concerning 
table of contents the applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities  respectively 
the government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce emtala violations actively in the future 
we believe that we operate in substantial compliance with emtala 
health care industry investigations we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business  including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation 
please see item legal proceedings included herein for disclosure related to false claim act case against certain of our behavioral health care facilities located in virginia and california and a false claim act investigation being conducted in connection with the implementation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators from to the present at several of our acute care facilities 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices  including ours 
although we believe our policies  procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations  no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions  or that we will not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties in connection with the investigations 
even if we were to ultimately prevail  the government s inquiry and or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
our substantial medicare  medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations 
it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity 
it is also possible that our executives and or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and or named as defendants in private litigation 
revenue rulings and in march and may  the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for profit and not for profit hospitals 
as a result of the tax rulings  the irs has proposed  and may in the future propose  to revoke the tax exempt or public charity status of certain not for profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them 
the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the tax exempt or public charity status of a not for profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not for profit hospitals  and or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not for profits 
state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues  assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state 
in the aggregate  state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially  adversely affected our results of operations 
compliance program our company wide compliance program has been in place since currently  the program s elements include a code of conduct  risk area specific policies and procedures  employee education and training  an internal system for reporting concerns  auditing and monitoring programs  and a means for enforcing the program s policies 
since its initial adoption  the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry s expectations and our needs 
specific written policies  procedures  training and educational materials and programs  as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business 
specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program 
claims preparation and submission  including coding  billing  and cost reports  comprise the bulk of these areas 
financial arrangements with physicians and 
table of contents other referral sources  including compliance with anti kickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training  standardized documentation requirements  and review and audit 
medical staff and employees our facilities had approximately  employees on december   of whom approximately  were employed full time 
approximately  of these employees approximately  full time employees are employed by the facilities acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of psi in november  our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals 
typically  physicians are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours 
within our acute care division  approximately physicians are employed either directly by certain of our facilities or affiliated by group practices structured as a corporations 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time 
in addition  we employ approximately psychiatrists within our behavioral health division 
each of our hospitals are managed on a day to day basis by a managing director employed by us 
in addition  a board of governors  including members of the hospital s medical staff  governs the medical  professional and ethical practices at each hospital 
approximately  of our employees at seven of our hospitals are unionized 
at valley hospital medical center  unionized employees belong to the culinary workers and bartenders union  the international union of operating engineers and the service employees international union seiu 
nurses and technicians at desert springs hospital are represented by the seiu 
registered nurses at auburn regional medical center located in washington  are represented by the united staff nurses union  the technical employees are represented by the united food and commercial workers  and the service employees are represented by the seiu 
at the george washington university hospital  unionized employees are represented by the seiu or the hospital police association 
registered nurses  licensed practical nurses  certain technicians and therapists  pharmacy assistants  and some clerical employees at hri hospital in boston are represented by the seiu 
at pennsylvania clinical schools  unionized employees are represented by the district council  american federation of state  county and municipal employees afl cio 
at brooke glen behavioral hospital  unionized employees are represented by the teamsters and the northwestern nurses association pennsylvania association of staff nurses and allied professionals 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
competition the health care industry is highly competitive 
in recent years  competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to  among other things  regulatory and technological changes  increasing use of managed care payment systems  cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment 
in all of the geographical areas in which we operate  there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
in addition  some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property  sale and income taxes 
such exemptions and support are not available to us 
in some markets  certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources  be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us 
certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical  surgical and behavioral health services  facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals 
the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us 
the number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in determining a hospital s success and competitive advantage 
typically  physicians are responsible for making hospital 
table of contents admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment 
we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient s needs  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital s facilities 
we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel  technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians 
in addition  we depend on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical support personnel  including our nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical personnel 
our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
in addition  in some markets like california  there are requirements to maintain specified nurse staffing levels 
to the extent we cannot meet those levels  we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws 
the application process for approval of additional covered services  new facilities  changes in operations and capital expenditures is  therefore  highly competitive in these states 
in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
see regulation and other factors 
our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals 
managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
in return  hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price  market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of the medical staff and convenience 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations 
a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals is significant 
we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for profit health care companies  as well as from not for profit entities 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth  but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms

any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory  economic  environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results 
our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and  in some cases  reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services 
payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments  as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of  among other things  the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions  the funding requirements from the federal government s stimulus package  the war on terrorism and the relief efforts related to hurricanes and other disasters  may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs 
if the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
on a prospective basis including the projected revenues generated at the facilities acquired from psi  we expect to receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from pennsylvania  illinois  washington  dc  nevada and virginia 
these states  as well as most other states in which we operate  have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in proposed reductions to medicaid funding for we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in these states  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs  our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors  including managed care providers  significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals 
private payors  including managed care providers  increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment 
we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations 

table of contents a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations 
our patient volumes  revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance  which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets 
a continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued increase in the unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance 
as a result  our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes  particularly in less intense  more elective service lines  or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients 
these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes  revenues and operating results 
our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions  particularly in certain markets  such as nevada  texas and california  where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high 
in our acute care business  we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities 
we can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue 
during  our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile and are unfavorable compared to the comparable prior year period  making it difficult to predict the results for or thereafter 
we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform 
on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca 
the healthcare and education reconciliation act of the reconciliation act  which contains a number of amendments to the ppaca  was signed into law on march  two primary goals of the ppaca  combined with the reconciliation act collectively referred to as the legislation  are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare related expenses 
although it is expected that as a result of the legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients  which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable  the legislation makes a number of other changes to medicare and medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us 
the legislation revises reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals 
the legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years through  a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning october  for medicare part b reimbursable items and services and beginning october  for medicare inpatient hospital services 
the legislation will reduce medicare and medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in  which would adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs 
the legislation implements a value based purchasing program  which will reward the delivery of efficient care 
conversely  certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters  such hospitals may include those with excessive readmission or hospital acquired condition rates 
the various provisions in the legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years 
legislation provisions are likely to be affected by the incomplete nature of implementing regulations or expected forthcoming interpretive guidance  gradual implementation  future legislation  and possible judicial nullification of all or certain provisions of the legislation 
further legislation provisions  such as those creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board  create certain flexibilities in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future 
thus  we cannot predict the impact of the legislation on our future reimbursement at this time 
the legislation also contains provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare 
the legislation amends several existing laws  including the federal anti kickback statute and the false claims act  making it 
table of contents easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers 
congress revised the intent requirement of the anti kickback statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti kickback statute in order to be found guilty of violating such law 
the legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the anti kickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil false claims act 
the legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of days is subject to the federal civil false claims act 
the legislation also expands the recovery audit contractor program to medicaid 
these amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations 
we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities 
these investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self referral law 
the legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions  but physicians are prohibited  effective immediately  from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital 
the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities 
the impact of the legislation on each of our hospitals may vary 
because legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years  we anticipate that many of the provisions in the legislation may be subject to further revision or judicial nullification 
we cannot predict the impact the legislation may have on our business  results of operations  cash flow  capital resources and liquidity  or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the legislation 
we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay 
in accordance with our internal policies and procedures  as well as the emergency medical treatment and active labor act  or emtala  we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor and or seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition 
if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition  we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patient s medical condition  within the facility s capability  or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospital s written procedures 
our obligations under emtala may increase substantially going forward  cms has recently announced its intent to issue proposed rulemaking concerning the applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities  respectively 
if the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly  or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under emtala is proposed and adopted  our results of operations will be harmed 
an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations 
collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patient s responsibility  which primarily includes co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
significant changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flow and results of operations 
if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses  our results of operations will be harmed 

table of contents our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive  and competition among hospitals  and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years 
in all of the geographical areas in which we operate  there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property  sales and income taxes 
such exemptions and support are not available to us 
in some markets  certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources  be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we 
the number of inpatient facilities  as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers  many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians  in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly 
as a result  most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
if our competitors are better able to attract patients  recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed 
our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians 
typically  physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment 
as a result  the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends  in part  on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians 
physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals  and  in a number of our markets  physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals 
they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time 
if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards  adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians  they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline 
it may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the non urban communities in which our hospitals are located 
our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations 
we depend on the efforts  abilities  and experience of our medical support personnel  including our nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals 
we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical personnel 
the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers 
this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel 
in addition  in some markets like california  there are requirements to maintain specified nurse staffing levels 
to the extent we cannot meet those levels  we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets  which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff 
if our general labor and related expenses increase  we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly 
our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management  nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels relating to  among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services  relationships with physicians and other referral sources  adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services  ownership of facilities  qualifications of medical and support personnel  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with health related information and patient medical records  the screening  stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions  certification  licensure and accreditation of our facilities  operating policies and procedures  and  construction or expansion of facilities and services 
among these laws are the federal false claims act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  the federal anti kickback statute and the provision of the social security act commonly known as the stark law 
these laws  and particularly the anti kickback statute and the stark law  impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities  including employment contracts  leases and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals 
the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services  or oig  has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
a number of our current arrangements  including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources  may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the anti kickback statute 
failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 
cms recently published a medicare self referral disclosure protocol  which is intended to allow providers to self disclose actual or potential violations of the stark law 
because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the stark law  there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the stark law or that self disclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex  and  in many cases  we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation 
in the future  it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws see item legal proceedings  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
in addition  we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted  what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be 
see item business self referral and anti kickback legislation 
if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including criminal penalties  civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities  and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities 
we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits  product liability lawsuits  class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
some of these actions may involve large claims  as well as 
table of contents significant defense costs 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us 
all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations 
we believe that  based on our past experience and actuarial estimates  our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals 
while we continuously monitor our coverage  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future  or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be subject to governmental investigations  regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam  or whistleblower  lawsuits against companies 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal  we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware 
in  we agreed to settle a qui tam lawsuit relating to our south texas health system after many years of governmental investigations 
some of our subsidiaries operating small behavioral healthcare facilities in virginia and california are currently the subject of governmental investigations and  in two cases  a qui tam action in which the government intervened and is charging violations of the false claims act 
we cannot predict whether we will be the subject of additional investigations or whistleblower lawsuits 
any determination that we have violated applicable laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 
if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation  such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid 
the construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention  rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection 
additionally  such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards 
all of our hospitals are deemed certified  meaning that they are accredited  properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program 
the effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal  state  local and other relevant regulations and standards 
however  should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs  such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected 
during the third quarter of  southwest healthcare system swhcs  which operates rancho springs medical center and inland valley regional medical center in riverside county  california  entered into an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the agreement required swhcs to engage an independent quality monitor to assist swhcs in meeting all cms conditions of participation 
further  the agreement provided that  during the last days of the agreement  cms would conduct a full medicare certification survey 
that survey took place the week of january  in april   swhcs received notification from cms that it intended to effectuate the termination of swhcs s medicare provider agreement effective june  in may   swhcs entered into an agreement with cms which abated the termination action scheduled for june  the agreement is one year in duration and required swhcs to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for swhcs to meet the medicare conditions of participation 
at the conclusion of the 
table of contents agreement  cms will conduct a full certification survey to determine if swhcs has achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation 
during the term of the agreement  swhcs remains eligible to receive reimbursements from medicare for services rendered to medicare beneficiaries 
also in april   swhcs received notification from the california department of public health cdph indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke swhcs s hospital license 
in may   swhcs received the formal document related to the revocation action 
in september   swhcs entered into an agreement with cdph relating to the license revocation 
the terms of the cdph agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with cms 
as a result of the agreement  swhcs s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the cms full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement 
pursuant to the results of the cms full certification survey  which we anticipate occurring in mid year   should swhcs be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  cdph shall deem swhcs s license to be in good standing 
failure of swhcs to achieve substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  pursuant to cms s full certification survey  will likely have a material adverse impact on swhcs s ability to continue to operate the facilities 
as a result of the matters discussed above  we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center 
however  in february   we received permission from cdph to begin accessing the new capacity 
unrelated to these developments  we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of we are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on swhcs s results of operations in and beyond 
rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center remain fully committed to providing high quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve 
we therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both cms and cdph in an effort to resolve these matters  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so 
failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us 
for the years ended december  and  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  swhcs generated approximately and  respectively  of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition of psi or realize the potential benefits of the acquisition  which could cause an adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to combine successfully the operations of psi with our operations  and  even if such integration is accomplished  we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition 
the integration of psi with our operations requires significant attention from management and may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects 
the integration of psi also involves a significant capital commitment  and the return that we achieve on any capital invested may be less than the return that we would achieve on our other projects or investments 
any of these factors could cause delays or increased costs of combining psi with us and could adversely affect our operations  financial results and liquidity 
our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of psi could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of psi could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness 

table of contents in connection with the consummation of our acquisition of psi  in addition to undertaking a million offering of notes in september   we obtained a debt financing commitment of billion under a senior credit facility consisting of an million revolving credit facility  a billion term loan a facility and a billion term loan b facility 
the senior credit facility became effective upon closing of the acquisition of psi  which occurred in november  we also obtained an amended million accounts receivable securitization facility during increased from million 
as of december   after giving effect to the use of proceeds from the various debt financing sources mentioned above  our total debt was billion and we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our senior credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities  after taking into account million of outstanding letters of credit and million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to our short term  on demand note 
subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility  the indenture that governs the notes and our other debt instruments  we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital  capital expenditures  investments or acquisitions  or for other purposes 
if we do so  the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify 
our leverage could result in unfavorable impact on us  including the following it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  some of our borrowings  including borrowings under the credit facilities  are at variable rates of interest  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates  it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and  we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business  or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our operations 
our growth strategy depends  in part  on acquisitions  and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria 
we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from not for profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny 
acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy 
we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other for profit healthcare companies  as well as from not for profit entities 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
also  suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms 
in addition  many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  laws that affect the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals to for profit entities 
these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions 
although the level of government involvement varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and  in some cases  approval of a transaction in which a not for profit entity sells a healthcare facility to a for profit entity 
the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation  increased review of not for profit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals  increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria  any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations 

table of contents further  the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations  depending on various factors  including the amount paid for the acquisition  the acquired hospital s results of operations  allocation of the purchase price  effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases 
we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire  which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy 
we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations 
we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals 
integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business  negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel 
in addition  acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  operations and  usually  information systems that are used by acquired hospitals 
in addition  some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition 
if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire  operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals  our results of operations could be harmed 
if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities  we could become liable for material obligations 
hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including  but not limited to  liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters  we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire 
such liabilities and related legal or other costs and or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could harm our business 
our subsidiary  psi  and its subsidiaries  are subject to pending legal actions  governmental investigations and regulatory actions 
our subsidiary  psi  and its subsidiaries  are subject to pending legal actions  governmental investigations and regulatory actions see item legal proceedings 
state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand 
many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need  or con  laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures  construction  expansion  modernization or initiation of major new services 
our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition  expansion or replacement  make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs  result in the revocation of a facility s license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements 
in the past  we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements  but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations 
controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues 
controls imposed by third party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay  commonly referred to as utilization review  have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities 
utilization 
table of contents review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
fluctuations in our operating results  quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock 
the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and  as a result  there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future  the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized 
in addition to our operating results  many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings 
these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein  demographic changes  operating results of other hospital companies  changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  the possible effects of war  terrorist and other hostilities  adverse weather conditions  the level of seasonal illnesses  managed care contract negotiations and terminations  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets  or other developments affecting the health care industry 
we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to a significant body of regulation  including the sarbanes oxley act of while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements  we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations 
for example  we cannot provide assurance that  in the future  our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  fines or other sanctions or litigation 
if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  our stock price could decline 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor 
such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects 
the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased 
as we continue to invest in modern technologies  emergency rooms and operating room expansions  the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care  we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds 
in addition  we have a commitment with an unrelated third party to build a newly constructed facility with a specified minimum number of beds and services 
although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital  such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained 
the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed 
we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation  expansion  construction and addition of medical equipment and technology 
we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand  improve and equip our existing hospitals 
we cannot predict  however  whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed  which could harm our business 
to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs  we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate  long term debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program 
if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments  our liquidity could be impacted  which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding 
in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time 
our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business 
the expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business 
the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient  quality healthcare services at our facilities  which could harm our business 
the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock is subject to potential increases or decreases 
at december    shares of class b common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of class a  c and d common stock outstanding  for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase class b common stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans 
class a  c and d common stock are convertible on a share for share basis into class b common stock 
to the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of class b common stock  the number of shares of class b common stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the holders of class b common stock would own a smaller percentage of that class 

table of contents in addition  from time to time our board of directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our class b common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
conversely  as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business  we may from time to time issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
based upon factors such as  but not limited to  the market price of our stock  interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash  repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share 
the right to elect the majority of our board of directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of class a and c common stock  the majority of which is owned by alan b 
miller  our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides that  with respect to the election of directors  holders of class a common stock vote as a class with the holders of class c common stock  and holders of class b common stock vote as a class with holders of class d common stock  with holders of all classes of our common stock entitled to one vote per share 
as of march   the shares of class a and class c common stock constituted of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock  had the right to elect six members of the board of directors and constituted of our general voting power 
as of march   the shares of class b and class d common stock excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options constituted of the outstanding shares of our common stock  had the right to elect two members of the board of directors and constituted of our general voting power 
as to matters other than the election of directors  our restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of class a  class b  class c and class d common stock all vote together as a single class  except as otherwise provided by law 
each share of class a common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote  each share of class b common stock entitles the holder thereof to one tenth of a vote  each share of class c common stock entitles the holder thereof to votes provided the holder of class c common stock holds a number of shares of class a common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class c common stock that holder holds  and each share of class d common stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes provided the holder of class d common stock holds a number of shares of class b common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class d common stock that holder holds 
in the event a holder of class c or class d common stock holds a number of shares of class a or class b common stock  respectively  less than ten times the number of shares of class c or class d common stock that holder holds  then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of class c common stock  or one tenth of a vote for every share of class d common stock  which that holder holds in excess of one tenth the number of shares of class a or class b common stock  respectively  held by that holder 
the board of directors  in its discretion  may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of class a or class b common stock as class c or class d common stock  respectively  if such facts are not apparent from our stock records 
since a substantial majority of the class a shares and class c shares are controlled by mr 
alan b 
miller and members of his family who are also directors and officers of our company  and they can elect a majority of our company s directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders  there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company 
in addition  because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses  our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected

table of contents item legal proceedings us v 
marion and uhs in late  july  and january   the office of inspector general for the department of health and human services oig issued a series of subpoenas seeking documents related to the treatment of medicaid beneficiaries at two of our facilities  marion youth center and mountain youth academy 
it was our understanding at that time that the oig was investigating whether claims for reimbursement submitted by those facilities to the virginia medicaid program were supported by adequate documentation of the services provided which could be considered to be a basis for a false claims act violation 
in august   the office of the attorney general for the commonwealth of virginia issued a subpoena to keystone newport news  another of our facilities 
it was our understanding at that time that the office of attorney general was investigating whether keystone newport news complied with various virginia laws and regulations  including documentation requirements 
in response to these subpoenas  we produced the requested documents on a rolling basis and we cooperated with the investigations in all respects 
we also met with representatives of the oig  the virginia attorney general  the united states attorney for the western district of virginia  and the united states department of justice civil division on several occasions to discuss a possible resolution of this matter 
however  the parties were not able to reach a resolution 
consequently  in november   the united states department of justice and the virginia attorney general intervened in a qui tam case that had been filed by former employees of marion youth center under seal in against universal health services  inc uhs  and keystone marion  llc and keystone education and youth services  llc keystone 
the department of justice and the commonwealth of virginia filed and served their complaint which  at present  relates solely to the marion youth center 
the complaint originally alleged causes of action pursuant to the federal and state false claims acts  the virginia fraud statute  and unjust enrichment 
the former employees filed a separate amended complaint  alleging employment and retaliation claims as well as false claim act violations 
in april   the defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to dismiss the claims filed by the government and the former employees 
in july   the court ruled on the motions  granting them in part and denying them in part 
the court has allowed the government to proceed with its claims under the federal and state false claims act and the virginia fraud statute 
in addition  the court has allowed the former employees to proceed with parts of their employment related and retaliation claims 
we have established a reserve in connection with this matter which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the government s and the former employees allegations 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in the litigation or that the case will be limited to the marion youth center 
devore  et 
al 
v 
keystone education and youth services  llc alicante school in california was acquired by a subsidiary of ours in october  prior to our acquisition  two former employees of the facility filed a false claim act qui tam action and a gender discrimination whistleblower claim in sacramento county superior court 
the plaintiffs allege that the alicante school improperly billed subdivisions of the state of california based upon services provided at the school and that the plaintiffs were discriminated against based upon their gender and as a result of their objection to these practices 
in june   we entered into an agreement with the former owners of the facility whereby they agreed to defend the case  indemnify us and hold us harmless for any damages that may result from this case 
the former owners of the facility had been funding the legal defense of this case since that time 
recently  the court approved the agreed upon million settlement of this matter which we paid to the plaintiffs in january  since we have made a demand on the former owners of the facility for repayment  and intend to pursue collection of the million pursuant to the june  indemnification agreement although we can provide no assurance that we will collect the entire million  the settlement amount and related receivable is reflected in other current assets and other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents martin v 
uhs of delaware uhs of delaware  inc  a subsidiary  and one of our non public schools in california operated by one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a state false claim act case in sacramento county superior court 
plaintiffs are a former student and employees of the elmira school who claim that the uhs schools in california unlawfully retained public education funding from the state of california for the operation of these schools but failed to meet state requirements to qualify as a non public school 
plaintiffs have also claimed that we committed unfair business practices associated with these allegations 
we deny liability and intend to defend this case vigorously 
we are presently uncertain as to the legal viability of the claims and are unable to determine the extent of potential financial exposure  if any  at this time 
wage and hour class actions ethridge v 
universal health services et 
al in june   we and one of our acute care facilities  lancaster community hospital  were named as defendants in a wage and hour lawsuit in los angeles county superior court 
this is a purported class action lawsuit alleging that the hospital failed to provide sufficient meal and break periods to certain employees 
in june  a settlement was reached with the attorneys for the class representative 
the settlement was recently approved by the court 
the reserve established for the settlement of this matter did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other we and or our subsidiaries are presently involved in three other wage and hour class action cases in california and tennessee 
two of those cases have been certified as a class by the california state superior court in alameda county and the united states district court for the western district of tennessee  respectively

department of justice icd investigation in september   we  along with many other companies in the healthcare industry  received a letter from the united states department of justice doj advising of a false claim act investigation being conducted in connection with the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds from to the present at several of our acute care facilities 
the doj alleges that icds were implanted and billed by our facilities in contravention of a national claims determination regarding these devices 
at present  we are uncertain as to the extent of the claims  liability for such claims and potential financial exposure in connection with this matter 
other matters the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include  among other things  matters such as government healthcare participation requirements  various licensure  certifications  and accreditations  reimbursement for patient services  and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse 
government action has increased with respect to investigations and or allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes and or regulations by healthcare providers 
providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs  subjected to potential licensure  certification  and or accreditation revocation  subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services 
we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards 
because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving  governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent 
table of contents with industry practices  including ours 
although we believe our policies  procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations  there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions  fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions  including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein

southwest healthcare system during the third quarter of  southwest healthcare system swhcs  which operates rancho springs medical center and inland valley regional medical center in riverside county  california  entered into an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the agreement required swhcs to engage an independent quality monitor to assist swhcs in meeting all cms conditions of participation 
further  the agreement provided that  during the last days of the agreement  cms would conduct a full medicare certification survey 
that survey took place the week of january  in april   swhcs received notification from cms that it intended to effectuate the termination of swhcs s medicare provider agreement effective june  in may   swhcs entered into an agreement with cms which abated the termination action scheduled for june  the agreement is one year in duration and required swhcs to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for swhcs to meet the medicare conditions of participation 
at the conclusion of the agreement  cms will conduct a full certification survey to determine if swhcs has achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation 
during the term of the agreement  swhcs remains eligible to receive reimbursements from medicare for services rendered to medicare beneficiaries 
also in april   swhcs received notification from the california department of public health cdph indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke swhcs s hospital license 
in may   swhcs received the formal document related to the revocation action 
in september   swhcs entered into an agreement with cdph relating to the license revocation 
the terms of the cdph agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with cms 
as a result of the agreement  swhcs s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the cms full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement 
pursuant to the results of the cms full certification survey  which we anticipate occurring in mid year   should swhcs be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  cdph shall deem swhcs s license to be in good standing 
failure of swhcs to achieve substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  pursuant to cms s full certification survey  will likely have a material adverse impact on swhcs s ability to continue to operate the facilities 
as a result of the matters discussed above  we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center 
however  in february   we received permission from cdph to begin accessing the new capacity 
unrelated to these developments  we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of we are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on swhcs s results of operations in and beyond 
rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center remain fully committed to providing high quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve 
we therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both cms and cdph in an effort to resolve these matters  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so 
failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us 
for the years ended december  and  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  swhcs generated approximately and  respectively  of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest

department of justice investigation of sierra vista in  sierra vista hospital in sacramento  california learned of an investigation by the us department of justice doj relating to medicare services provided by the facility

forward looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results  and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at  or by which  such performance or results will be achieved 
forward looking information is based on information available at the time and or our good faith belief with respect to future events  and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations  and or changes in laws and government regulations  an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level 
no assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  
table of contents possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs  including medicare or medicaid  an increase in the number of uninsured and self pay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self pay patient accounts  our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same  including contracts with united sierra healthcare and the healthcare services coalition in las vegas  nevada  the outcome of known and unknown litigation  government investigations  false claim act allegations  and liabilities and other claims asserted against us  including matters as disclosed in item legal proceedings  the potential unfavorable impact on our business of continued deterioration in national  regional and local economic and business conditions  including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions  competition from other healthcare providers  including physician owned facilities in certain markets  including mcallen edinburg  texas  the site of one of our largest acute care facilities  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing  or reduce the demand for healthcare  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  nurses  physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals  demographic changes  our acquisition of psi i has substantially increased our level of indebtedness which could  among other things  adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness  and  ii will require us to successfully integrate the operations of psi with our operations and  even if such integration is accomplished  we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition  our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities  a significant portion of our revenues is produced by facilities located in nevada  texas and california making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been proposed for as well as regulatory  economic  environmental and competitive changes in those states  our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms  including borrowed funds  to fund the future growth of our business  some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends  our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations in july  implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act 
the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs 
the implementation period for these new medicare and 
table of contents medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year and can end as late as for medicare and for the state medicaid programs 
our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria 
our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an ehr application  on a facility by facility basis  beginning in and ending in  however  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and  should we qualify  we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility 
should we qualify for incentive payments  there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr application which may cause material period to period changes in our future results of operations 
hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in and each subsequent fiscal year 
although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by  there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act  the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms  changes in our business strategies or development plans  fluctuations in the value of our common stock  and  other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
southwest healthcare system during the third quarter of  southwest healthcare system swhcs  which operates rancho springs medical center and inland valley regional medical center in riverside county  california  entered into an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the agreement required swhcs to engage an independent quality monitor to assist swhcs in meeting all cms conditions of participation 
further  the agreement provided that  during the last days of the agreement  cms would conduct a full medicare certification survey 
that survey took place the week of january  in april   swhcs received notification from cms that it intended to effectuate the termination of swhcs s medicare provider agreement effective june  in may   swhcs entered into an agreement with cms which abated the termination action scheduled for june  the agreement is one year in duration and required swhcs to engage independent experts in various disciplines to analyze and develop implementation plans for swhcs to meet the medicare conditions of participation 
at the conclusion of the agreement  cms will conduct a full certification survey to determine if swhcs has achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation 
during the term of the agreement  swhcs remains eligible to receive reimbursements from medicare for services rendered to medicare beneficiaries 
also in april   swhcs received notification from the california department of public health cdph indicating that it planned to initiate a process to revoke swhcs s hospital license 
in may   swhcs received the formal document related to the revocation action 
in september   swhcs entered into an agreement with cdph relating to the license revocation 
the terms of the cdph agreement are substantially similar to those contained in the agreement with cms 
as a result of the agreement  swhcs s hospital license remains in effect pending the outcome of the cms full certification survey which will occur at the end of the agreement 
pursuant to the results of the cms full certification survey  which we anticipate occurring in mid year   should swhcs be deemed to have achieved substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  cdph shall deem swhcs s license to be in good standing 
failure of swhcs to achieve substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation  pursuant to cms s full certification survey  will likely have a material adverse impact on swhcs s ability to continue to operate the facilities 

table of contents as a result of the matters discussed above  we were not previously permitted to open newly constructed capacity at rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center 
however  in february   we received permission from cdph to begin accessing the new capacity 
unrelated to these developments  we expect a competitor to open a newly constructed acute care hospital during the first quarter of we are unable to predict the net impact of these developments on swhcs s results of operations in and beyond 
rancho springs medical center and inland valley medical center remain fully committed to providing high quality healthcare to their patients and the communities they serve 
we therefore intend to work expeditiously and collaboratively with both cms and cdph in an effort to resolve these matters  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so 
failure to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on us 
for the years ended december  and  after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense  swhcs generated approximately and  respectively  of our income from operations after income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
given these uncertainties  risks and assumptions  as outlined above  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made 
we assume no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward looking information  except as may be required by law 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided 
medicare and medicaid revenues represented of our net patient revenues during each of  and revenues from managed care entities  including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for of our net patient revenues during each of  and we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third party payors and others for services rendered 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information  patient utilization data  government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations 
the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded 
table of contents estimates will change by material amounts in the near term 
certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital  medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements 
such amounts are included in accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes 
as such  we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations  if enacted  will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in  or if it were to occur  each adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december   would change our after tax net income by approximately million 
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts  based on charges at established rates  amounting to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at our acute care facilities  medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third party payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states 
approximately or million as of december  and or million as of december  of our accounts receivable  net  were comprised of medicaid pending accounts 
our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration 
at that time  an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned 
there are various pre established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered 
certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible 
when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s medicaid eligibility 
based on historical hindsight information related to medicaid pending accounts  we estimate that approximately or million of the million medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  will subsequently qualify for medicaid reimbursement 
approximately or million of million total medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  subsequently qualified for medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration 
additional charity reserves of million during and million during were established to cover the medicaid pending patients that failed to qualify for the medicaid program based on historical conversion rates 
based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts  our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending  as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications  are considered when the overall individual facility and company wide reserves are developed 

table of contents below are the medicaid pending receivable agings as of december  and amounts in thousands under days days days over days total provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility  primarily co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
at our acute care hospitals  third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account 
for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients  the patient is sent a series of statements and collection letters 
patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of assistance including our charity care policy 
if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay  the account is written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort 
our accounts receivable are recorded net of established charity care reserves of million as of december  and million as of december  uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of at least of total charges 
during the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay balances outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
all self pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they have been outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past days from the date of discharge 
potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay 
on a consolidated basis  we monitor our total self pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience 
at december  and december   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
approximately during  during and during  of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts  was incurred by our acute care hospitals 
shown below is our payer mix concentrations and related aging of our billed accounts receivable  net of contractual allowances  for our acute care hospitals as of december  and as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total 
table of contents as of december  amounts in thousands days days days over days medicare medicaid commercial insurance and other private pay total self insured risks we provide for self insured risks  primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims 
our estimated liability for self insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including  among other things  the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies 
all relevant information  including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims 
while we continuously monitor these factors  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate 
our estimated self insured reserves are reviewed and changed  if necessary  at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense 
given our significant self insured exposure for professional and general liability claims  there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number and or severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
professional and general liability claims effective january   most of our subsidiaries became self insured for professional and general liability exposure up to million per occurrence as compared to million per occurrence prior to 
prior to our acquisition of psi in november   our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
however  we are liable for of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
prior to our acquisition in november   the psi facilities were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a million self insured retention to a limit of million 
psi utilized its captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of psi 
since our acquisition of psi on november   the former psi subsidiaries are self insured for professional and general liability exposure up to million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries which are not former psi subsidiaries are self insured for professional and general liability exposure up to million per occurrence 
effective november   our subsidiaries including the former psi subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence self insured retention either million or million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
we remain liable for of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of million up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
upon our acquisition of psi  we conducted a thorough analysis of psi s claims and related reserves and  with the assistance of an independent third party actuary  we determined that the aggregate self insured retention estimate for the pre acquisition professional and general liability claims amounted to million which is included in our total accrual as of december   as discussed below 

table of contents as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims  including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from psi  was million  of which million is included in current liabilities 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
based upon the results of reserve analyses  we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability self insurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to million during and million during these favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments were due to i an increased weighting given to company specific metrics to from  and decreased general industry metrics to from  related to projected incidents per exposure  historical claims experience and loss development factors  ii historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate  and  iii a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the company wide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years 
as the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased  thereby providing for a statistically significant data group  and taking into consideration our long history of company specific risk management programs and claims experience  our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends 
actuarially determined estimates for our provision for self insured professional and general liability claims were developed based upon similar metrics and weighting 
for the years of through  most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with phico  a pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation in february  as a result  although phico continued to be liable for claims on our behalf that were related to through  we began paying the claims upon phico s liquidation 
since that time  although we preserved our right to receive reimbursement from the phico estate  we were not previously able to assess the probability of collection or reasonably quantify our share of the liquidation proceeds 
in january   a court order from the commonwealth court of pennsylvania was executed in connection with the partial liquidation of the phico estate 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  based upon our share of the undisputed and resolved claims made against the phico estate as of a specified date and as approved by the liquidator to the court  we recorded a million reduction to our professional and general liability self insured claims expense 
these liquidation proceeds were received during the first quarter of based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses  we recorded reductions to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to million during  million during and million during although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for self insured general and professional and workers compensation claims  given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above  it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves

in addition  we also maintain self insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims 
the ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
property insurance acute care facilities and legacy behavioral health care facilities we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses  including windstorm damage  up to a billion policy limit per occurrence  subject to  deductible 
losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between and of the declared total insurable value of the property 
in addition  we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage  each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is million  subject to a deductible of  except for facilities located within documented fault zones 
earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the united states are subject to a million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from to of the declared total insurable value of the property 
the earthquake limit in puerto rico is million 
flood losses have either a  or  deductible  based upon the location of the facility 
behavioral health care facilities acquired in november  the newly acquired facilities formerly owned by psi have all risk property coverage with a loss limit of million with a  deductible 
earth movement losses  except california  are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of million with a  per occurrence deductible 
earthquake coverage in california 
table of contents is further sub limited to an annual aggregate loss limit of million with a deductible of of the declared total insurable value of the property 
named windstorms are insured to million per occurrence but are potentially subject to applied deductibles ranging from to of the declared total insurable value of the property 
flood losses are subject to an annual aggregate loss limit of million with deductibles ranging from  to  flood losses that occur in designated high hazard areas are sub limited to million with a  deductible 
due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years  the cost of commercial property insurance has increased 
as a result  catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
we have designated september st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september  which indicated no impairment of goodwill 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including profitability and market value projections  could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carry forwards 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
we are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities 
our tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service irs through the year ended december  we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal  foreign and state taxes

the revenue pressures were caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities 
our acute care facilities located in texas were also unfavorably impacted by reductions in medicaid revenues 
also contributing to the decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes at our acute care facilities were increases in salaries  wages and benefits expense and supplies expense which increased beyond the rate of increase of our acute care revenues 
we continue to experience an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part  has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance

sources of revenue overview we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers  including managed care plans  the federal government under the medicare program  state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients 
hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services 
charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg  medical surgical  intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally 
table of contents increased in recent years  primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  as well as increased pressure from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurance plans  and managed care plans  but are responsible for services not covered by such plans  exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has generally been increasing each year 
indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payors and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided 
since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in nevada  texas and california  we are particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic  environmental and competition changes in those states 
any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory  economic  environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results 
the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for i our acute care and behavioral health care facilities combined  ii our acute care facilities  and  iii our behavioral health care facilities 
net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates  which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated

table of contents percentage of net patient revenues behavioral health care facilities third party payors medicare medicaid managed care hmo and ppos other sources total medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program  our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program 
under the medicare program  for inpatient services  our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps 
under the ipps  hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge 
the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s medicare severity diagnosis related group ms drg 
every ms drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
the ms drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care 
this ms drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each ms drg 
the ms drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity 
while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services  other than the ms drg payment  a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold 
ms drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the index used to adjust the ms drg rates  known as the hospital market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services 
generally  however  the percentage increases in the ms drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
in july   cms published the final ipps payment rule which provided for a market basket increase to the base medicare ms drg blended rate 
when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered  our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year rule was approximately 
in july   cms published its final ipps payment rule which provided for a market basket increase to the base medicare ms drg blended rate 
when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments are considered  we estimate our overall decrease from the proposed federal fiscal year rule will approximate 
in addition  as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below  cms is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by in federal fiscal year in september   the tma  abstinence education  and qi programs extension act of legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that cms was set to impose 
in federal fiscal years 
table of contents to  the new law requires cms to make adjustments to the medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years and as compared to the initial cms estimates 
in federal fiscal year  cms made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and will continue to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of ms drgs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals 
in july   the ipps proposed payment rule applied a reduction to the market basket update and indicated another reduction would also be applied in for documenting and coding 
in this same rule  cms indicated a remaining documenting and coding adjustment of reduction is still required to be made to future ipps updates 
cms did not indicate to which future federal fiscal year s this reduction would be applied 
on january   cms implemented a new psychiatric prospective payment system psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program 
this system replaced the cost based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics 
the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full service emergency department 
according to the may  cms notice  the market basket increase was for the period of july  through june  according to the april  cms notice  the market basket increase is for the period of july  through june  in january  cms published its proposed psych pps rule for the fifteen month period july  to september  the market basket increase for this time period is scheduled to be  which includes a reduction required by the federal health care reform legislation enacted in in october  cms published its annual final medicare outpatient prospective payment system opps rule for the final market basket increase to the opps base rate is

in july  the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act 
the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs 
the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria 
the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments starts in federal fiscal year and can end as late as for medicare and for the state medicaid programs 
state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary and we are unable to predict which states will chose to participate 
we estimate that approximately of the projected incentive payments will be paid by medicare and from state medicaid programs 
our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria 
these medicare and medicaid incentive payments are intended to offset a portion of the cost incurred to qualify as a meaningful user of ehr 
our acute care facilities are scheduled to implement an ehr application  on a facility by facility basis  beginning in and ending in however  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and  should we qualify  we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amount is dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each facility 
should we qualify for incentive payments  there may be timing differences in the recognition of the revenues and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of 
table of contents the ehr application which may cause material period to period changes in our future results of operations 
hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in and each subsequent fiscal year 
although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by  there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act 
medicaid medicaid is a joint federal state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps like system  or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program  we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from nevada  florida  california  washington  dc and illinois 
the majority of these states  as well as most other states in which we operate  have reported significant budget deficits that have resulted in the reduction of medicaid funding for and furthermore  many states are currently working to effectuate further significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding due to significant state budget deficits also projected for  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in the above mentioned states  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
conversely  on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of was signed into law and contained various medicaid provisions that will impact our hospitals including the following i temporary increases to medicaid funding through enhanced federal matching assistance percentages fmaps for a month period retroactive to october  through december  with all states receiving a fmap increase of and also receiving a bonus fmap increase contingent on the increased level of a state s unemployment rate  ii a temporary increase of in the federal medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotment for both federal fiscal years and  and  iii states will be required to maintain effort on medicaid eligibility consistent with requirements prior to passage of this law 
in august   hr was enacted into law and extended the enhanced fmaps until june   but at a reduced rate 
the fmap increase will be during the first quarter of and during the second quarter 
due to the indirect nature of the enhanced medicaid federal funding contained within the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and hr  we are unable to determine the impact of these medicaid changes on our future results of operations 
certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas hildalgo  maverick  potter and webb participate in cms approved private medicaid supplemental payment upl programs 
these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties 
our hospitals receive both upl payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from third party  affiliated hospitals 
the upl payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an inter governmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals 
we received million during  million during and million during  of aggregate  net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care payments 
if during the hospital district makes igts consistent with  we believe we would be entitled to aggregate  net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care payment revenues of approximately million during in july  the texas health and human services commission thhsc issued a final rule and will rebase during state fiscal year sfy  on a statewide budget neutral basis  all acute care hospital inpatient standard dollar amount sda rates 
in addition  the thhsc will also rebase all ms drg relative weights concurrent with this sda rate change 
the thhsc will use sfy cost report data for the sda and relative 
table of contents weight rebasing and will only make changes on a prospective basis regardless of when the rebased sda rates and relative weights are implemented 
the thhsc recently notified hospitals of their rebased sfy sda rates  preliminary statewide ms drg relative weights for sfy and the estimated statewide budget neutrality adjustment 
in addition  in october   thhsc finalized a rule whereby i the period november  to august  will be considered a transition period to fully rebased sda rates  and  ii fully rebased sda rates will then become effective september  we estimate that the november  rate changes will not have a material impact on our inpatient medicaid reimbursement 
in addition  we estimate the september  sda rate changes could potentially reduce our inpatient medicaid reimbursement by up to million annually 
the thhsc has indicated an intention to expand state medicaid managed care programs in future state fiscal years starting in the state s fiscal year 
although we are unable to determine the impact of the managed care expansion on future medicaid reimbursement or its impact on medicaid upl payments  depending on the actual structure of the actual managed care expansion  this change could have a material adverse impact on our medicaid upl payments 
managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies  which include health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs 
in general  we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate 
typically  we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers  however  during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies 
commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including predetermined payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals 
other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage 
such patients are evaluated  at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines  qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy 
patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances 
state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of low income patients ie  those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization  or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment 
congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments 
although this legislation and the resulting state broad based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program  to date the net impact has not been materially adverse 
upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolina s low income patients  five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received 
table of contents additional reimbursement from each state s dsh fund 
the texas and south carolina programs have been renewed for each state s fiscal years covering the period of october  through september  for each state 
in connection with these dsh programs  included in our financial results was an aggregate of million during  million during and million during failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates  failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs  or reductions in reimbursements  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

assuming that the texas and south carolina programs are renewed for each state s fiscal years at amounts similar to the fiscal year amounts  we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be million during sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits  the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding  which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of  among other things  the war on terrorism  economic recovery stimulus packages  responses to natural disasters  the expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
in march   the health care and education reconciliation act of hr  hr  the reconciliation act and the patient protection and affordable care act pl  the affordable care act  were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs 
medicare  medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below 
immediate medicare reductions the reconciliation act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities in each of and by 
further  the affordable care act implements certain reforms to medicare advantage payments  effective in future medicare reductions future changes to the medicare program include implements a medicare shared savings program effective implement a hospital readmissions reduction program effective implement a national pilot program on payment bundling effective implement a value based purchasing program for hospitals effective reduction to medicare disproportionate share hospital dsh payments effective medicaid revisions expanded medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments effective reduction to medicaid dsh effective health insurance revisions large employer insurance reforms effective individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies effective federally mandated insurance coverage reforms and forward 
table of contents although we do not believe the above mentioned medicare market basket reductions implemented in will have a material impact on our results of operations  we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above 
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs  our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings  new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations  post payment audits  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities 
the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments 
nevertheless  until final adjustments are made  certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
finally  we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations

pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the ftc  we are required to divest the facilities in delaware and nevada within approximately six months and the facility in puerto rico within approximately nine months from the date the ftc finalizes the agreement

this seasonality occurs because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years 
however  since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures  as are supply and other costs  we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
we believe  however  that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable
