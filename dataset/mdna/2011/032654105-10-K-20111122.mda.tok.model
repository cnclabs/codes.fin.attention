industry background semiconductor components are the electronic building blocks used in electronic systems and equipment 
these components are classified as either discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit 
integrated circuits may be divided into two general categories  digital and analog 
digital circuits  such as memory devices and microprocessors  generally process on off electrical signals  represented by binary digits  and in contrast  analog integrated circuits monitor  condition  amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties  such as temperature  pressure  weight  light  sound or motion  and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems 
analog ics also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems 
organizational structure we operate in one reporting segment  which is comprised of two separate groups  one focused on products and one focused on end markets 
the product group is focused on core technology development and leadership in converters  amplifiers and rf  mems  power management  and dsp 
the end market focused organization is dedicated to understanding  selecting  and resourcing initiatives that are more customized to a particular market or application 
the focus of this team is to apply the full expanse of our broad technology portfolio to more integrated and targeted product strategies for the industrial  automotive  consumer  and communications markets 
the end market group includes our sales organization 
these two groups collaborate at all levels 
on the one hand  our product group develops key technology for use by the end market groups  which apply these technologies to specific applications 
equally important  the applications expertise within each end market group is used to enhance core technology development by our product group 
principal products we design  manufacture and market a broad line of high performance ics that incorporate analog  mixed signal and digital signal processing technologies 
our ics are designed to address a wide range of real world signal processing applications 
our product portfolio includes both general purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications  as well as application specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets 
by using readily available  high performance  general purpose products in their systems  our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market 
given the high cost of developing more customized ics  our standard products often provide a cost effective solution for many low to medium volume applications 
however  for some industrial  automotive  consumer  and communications products  we focus on working with leading customers to design application specific solutions 
we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion  amplification  rf  mems  power management and dsp  and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers 
because we have already developed the core technology for our general purpose products  we can create application specific solutions quickly 
we produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reporting segment 
our ten highest revenue products  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of our revenue for fiscal a breakdown of our fiscal revenue by product category follows

digital signal processing products digital signal processing products dsps complete our product portfolio 
dsps are optimized for high speed numeric calculations  which are essential for instantaneous  or real time  processing of digital data generated  in most cases  from analog to digital signal conversion 
our dsps are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs  or algorithms  associated with processing digitized real time  real world data 
programmable dsps are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the device s function quickly and inexpensively using software 
our general purpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third party suppliers 
our dsps are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products 
we support these products with easy to use development tools  which are designed to reduce our customers product development costs and time to market 
our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal processing challenges across our core market and segment focus areas within the industrial  automotive  consumer and communications end markets 
as an integrated part of our customer s signal chain  there are typically many other analog devices products connected to our processors including converters  audio and video codecs and power management solutions 
markets and applications during fiscal year  we consolidated the computer end market  which represented approximately of fiscal revenue  into the consumer end market  and reclassified handset revenue  which represented approximately of fiscal revenue  from the communications end market to the consumer end market for all periods presented 
the breakdown of our fiscal revenue by end market is set out in the table below

in wireless and broadband communication applications  our products are incorporated into cellular basestation equipment wired networking equipment wireless backhowl systems satellite systems see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information about our products by category and end market 
research and development our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances 
accordingly  we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes  and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes 
we spent approximately million during fiscal on the design  development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes  compared to approximately million during fiscal and approximately million during fiscal our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters  amplifiers and rf  mems  power management  and dsp 
in support of our research and development activities  we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world 
patents and other intellectual property rights we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents  copyrights  mask works  trademarks and trade secrets 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate 
we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements 
we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries 
as of october   we held approximately  us patents and approximately non provisional pending us patent applications 
there can be no assurance  however  that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction 
while our patents  copyrights  mask works  trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection  we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge  innovative skills  technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel  the range and success of new products being developed by us  our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts  and customer service and technical support 
it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented  though we may elect  in certain cases  not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions  if we determine other protection  such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret  to be more advantageous 
we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 
sales channels we sell our products globally through a direct sales force  third party distributors  independent sales representatives and via our website 
we have direct sales offices  sales representatives and or distributors in over countries outside north america 
we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications  direct mail programs  promotional brochures  technical seminars and participation in trade shows 
we publish and distribute product catalogs  applications guides  technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products 
we also provide this information and sell products via our website 
we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 
in addition  we offer a variety of web based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 
we derived approximately of our fiscal revenue from sales made through distributors 
these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
some of them also sell products that compete with our products  including those for which we are an alternate source 
in all regions of the world  we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers 
we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit  as determined by us  in order to reduce the amounts of slow moving  discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 
these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter 
in addition  distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor 
additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
segment financial information and geographic information we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of five operating segments 
through subsidiaries and affiliates  we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenue from customers in international markets 
our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  import and export controls  and other laws  policies and regulations of foreign governments 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the categorization of sales into geographic regions set forth below is based upon the location of the customer 
geographic area of fy revenue united states rest of north south america europe japan china rest of asia for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry  segment and geographic areas  see our consolidated financial statements and note in the related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
customers we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide 
no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than of fiscal year   or revenue 
these customers used hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial  automotive  consumer and communication markets 
our largest single customer  excluding distributors  represented approximately of our fiscal revenue 
our largest customers  excluding distributors  accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenue 
seasonality sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season 
in general  the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  as explained in our risk factors contained in item a of this annual report on form k  our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 
production and raw materials monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication  wafer testing  cutting the wafer into individual chips  or dice  assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form 
the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers  processing chemicals including liquefied gases  precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 
we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high performance analog  dsp  mixed signal and mems ics 
we also use bipolar and complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  wafer fabrication processes 
our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third party wafer fabricators 
our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at third party wafer fabrication foundries using sub micron digital cmos processes 
a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal years  and was from products fabricated at third party wafer fabrication facilities  primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington  massachusetts and limerick  ireland 
we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use third party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
capital spending was approximately million in fiscal  compared with approximately million in fiscal we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal our products require a wide variety of components  raw materials and external foundry services  most of which we purchase from third party suppliers 
we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products 
however  a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers  primarily tsmc 
if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us  on the time schedule and of the quality that we require  we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers  which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing  product development and shipment of product to our customers 
although we have experienced shortages of components  materials and external foundry services from time to time  these items have generally been available to us as needed 
backlog backlog at the end of fiscal was approximately million  down from approximately million at the end of fiscal we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks 
backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and  in some instances  we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders 
as is customary in the semiconductor industry  we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty 
accordingly  we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 
we typically do not have long term sales contracts with our customers 
in some of our markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict  some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the product 
in other instances  we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand 
as a result  we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog 
further  those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  resulting in potential inventory write offs 
as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties  the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 
government contracts we estimate that approximately of our fiscal revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors 
our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated  firm  fixed price subcontracts 
most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 
acquisitions  divestitures and investments an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
from time to time  we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 
additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal  and is set forth in note u and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
competition we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors  including technological innovation  strength of brand  diversity of product portfolio  product performance  technical support  delivery capabilities  customer service quality  reliability and price  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets  and customers 
we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive 
our competitors include but are not limited to broadcom corporation maxim integrated products  inc cirrus logic  inc microchip technology  inc freescale semiconductor  inc nxp semiconductors infineon technologies st microelectronics intersil corporation silicon laboratories  inc knowles electronics texas instruments  inc linear technology corporation we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability  supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support  enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers competiveness in our chosen markets 
environment  health and safety we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees  customers and the public 
we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental  health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities  and to encourage pollution prevention  reduce our water and energy consumption  reduce waste generation  and strive towards continual improvement 
we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 
our management systems are certified to iso  ohsas  iso and ts we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition  eicc 
our sustainability report  first published in  states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards  among other things 
we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in  or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form k 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal  state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the transportation  storage  handling  use  emission  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products  including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union 
contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings  financial condition or competitive position 
there can be no assurance  however  that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines  suspension of production  the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  individuals worldwide 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  test and applications engineers involved in the design  support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes 
we believe that relations with our employees are good  however  the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
there is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
high unemployment rates  weakness in commercial and residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
financial turmoil may cause financial institutions to consolidate or go out of business  which increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair value assigned to them 
during the past few years  many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis 
some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and as these programs conclude  those businesses could be negatively impacted 
the continuing debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate  thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers 
in addition  the recent downgrade of the us credit rating and the ongoing european debt crisis have contributed to the instability in global credit markets 
we are unable to predict the impact of these events  and if economic conditions deteriorate  we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our future revenue  gross margins  operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 
our future revenue  gross margins  operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the effects of adverse economic conditions in the united states and international markets  changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products  the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations  including our ability to reduce our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us  our customers or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials  and manufacturing  assembly and test capacity  the ability of our third party suppliers  subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of products or components  any significant decline in our backlog  the timing  delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  our ability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  changes in geographic  product or customer mix  our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels  potential significant litigation related costs  the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels  including with respect to costs associated with labor  utilities  transportation and raw materials  the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental regulations  changes in our effective tax rates in the united states  ireland or worldwide  and the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  widespread travel disruptions  security risks  terrorist activities  international conflicts and other events beyond our control 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns 
our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance  depending on the mix of future business  that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue  gross margins  operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  if our revenue  gross margins  operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 
a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate  including increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions  the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including write offs of acquired in process research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions  the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards are less than those originally anticipated  changes in available tax credits  and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income for future periods 
long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions  cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically do not have long term sales contracts with our customers 
in certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict  some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the product 
in other instances  we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands 
as a result  we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders  leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog 
further  orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  causing potential inventory write offs 
as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties  the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 
incorrect forecasts  or reductions  cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate  improve our products  develop and market new products  and identify and enter new markets 
our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products 
product development  innovation and enhancement is often a complex  time consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development  with no assurance of return on investment 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards  which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs 
in addition  our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products  which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy 
any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations 
in addition  our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense 
also  some of our customers in these markets are less established  which could subject us to increased credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets  that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets  that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us  or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 
furthermore  a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 
we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry  and we expect this competition to increase in the future  including from companies located outside the united states 
many other companies offer products that compete with our products 
some have or as a result of consolidation within the industry may have greater financial  manufacturing  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have 
some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers 
our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve 
competition is generally based on design and quality of products  product performance  features and functionality  and product pricing  availability and capacity  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets and customers 
existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance  features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
we rely on third party suppliers  subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers  manufacturing processes and assembly and test services  and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on suppliers  assembly and test subcontractors  and third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes 
this reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over availability  capacity utilization  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  and costs 
additionally  we utilize a limited number of third party wafer fabricators  primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
in addition  these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints 
in certain instances  the third party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services 
if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes  we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers  which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 
if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available  we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could  in turn  result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal was from products fabricated at third party wafer fabrication facilities  primarily tsmc 
the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical  and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices  and conversely  we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly 
if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products  and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines  or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand  our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses  reduced margins  underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 
these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 
conversely  during periods of rapid increases in demand  our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand 
in addition  we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner  procure adequate resources  or locate suitable third party suppliers  to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims  which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 
semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed 
we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us 
we invest significant resources in the testing of our products  however  if any of our products contain defects  we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs  pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders 
these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others  including liability for costs associated with product recalls  which may adversely impact our operating results 
we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims 
our customers have on occasion been sued  and may in the future be sued  by third parties with respect to infringement or other product matters  and those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them 
in certain cases  our potential indemnification liability may be significant 
if any of our products contains defects  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged  which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing  it is possible that some processes could become unstable 
this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are involved in frequent litigation  including regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights  including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers 
other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products  if those patents are found to be valid 
from time to time  we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel 
we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards 
there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities 
we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers products due to an alleged failure of components we supply 
an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  mask work  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies  products and processes 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries in which we design  manufacture  market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  internal or external parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors  and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
we may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 
we may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses  illegal break ins or hacking  sabotage  acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism 
our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches 
any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information  cause an interruption in our operations  result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data  result in a violation of privacy or other laws  expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation  which could harm our business and operating results 
if we do not retain our key personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 
our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment  retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers 
the competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 
to remain competitive  we may need to acquire other companies  purchase or license technology from third parties  or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and  if we find such businesses  we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all 
acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and licensees  the need for regulatory approvals  and difficulties related to integration efforts 
both in the us and abroad  governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex  increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions 
in order to finance a potential transaction  we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 
acquisitions also involve a number of risks  including difficulty integrating acquired technologies  operations and personnel with our existing businesses  diversion of management attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets  strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations  the future funding requirements for acquired companies  which may be significant  potential loss of key employees  exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  and increased risk of costly and time consuming litigation 
if we are unable to successfully address these risks  we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition  which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 
we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas  which could affect the availability of supplies and services 
we  like many companies in the semiconductor industry  rely on internal manufacturing capacity  wafer fabrication foundries and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world 
this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry  including temporary loss of capacity  availability and cost of key raw materials  utilities and equipment and availability of key services  including transport of our products worldwide 
for example  in march  a severe earthquake and tsunami hit japan  which together with resulting damage to certain nuclear power plants created widespread destruction and economic uncertainty in that region 
japan represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities  or those of our subcontractors or third party wafer fabrication foundries  as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of utilities or otherwise  could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to business  economic  political  legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 
we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states  including in ireland and the philippines 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenue from customers in international markets 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 
potential interest rate increases  as well as high energy costs  could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of october   approximately  million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely  this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states 
we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements  stock repurchases  cash dividends and acquisitions 
if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations  through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost  it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested  and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws  which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry  we are also subject to the economic  political and legal risks inherent in international operations  including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets  ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world  as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies 
other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities  air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls  currency exchange rate movement  additional costs related to foreign taxes  tariffs and freight rate increases  exposure to different business practices and legal standards  particularly with respect to price protection  competition practices  intellectual property  anti corruption and environmental compliance  trade and travel restrictions  pandemics  import and export license requirements and restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations  and accounts receivable collections 
we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china 
our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china s continuously evolving laws and regulations  including those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  currency controls  environmental regulations  and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights 
enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent 
in addition  changes in the political environment  governmental policies or us china relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement  exposure of our proprietary intellectual property  increased taxation  restrictions on imports  import duties or currency revaluations  which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 
our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 
a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control 
these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us 
we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors 
our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our initiative or the distributor s initiative  could disrupt our current business  and if we are unable to find suitable replacements  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety ehs regulations  which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements  particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use  transportation  emission  discharge  storage and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
public attention to environmental concerns continues to increase  and our customers routinely include stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us 
changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made 
in addition  we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials 
any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages  penalties  and civil and criminal fines  and might damage our reputation  increase our expenses  and adversely affect our operating results 
new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations 
in addition  new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us 
the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations  and the us congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future 
the us environmental protection agency epa has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations 
epa is developing other climate change based regulations  as are certain states  that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings  financial condition or competitive position 
there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties  civil and criminal fines  suspension of or changes to production  legal liability and damage to our reputation 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  we may not be able to service our debt obligations  including making payments on our two issuances of million senior unsecured notes or our million term loan facility 
in fiscal  we issued in a public offering million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due july  in april  we issued in a public offering million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due april  in december  analog devices holdings bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  entered into a million term loan facility which matures on december  our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required to  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt  including the notes or our term loan facility  which could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 
restrictions in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 
our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our and senior unsecured notes impose  and future debt instruments to which we may become subject  may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company  including to undertake certain transactions  to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness 
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 
in addition  our credit and term loan facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
if we breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers  then  subject to applicable cure periods  our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future  as it may be significantly affected by the following factors crises in global credit  debt and financial markets  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance  changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products  technical innovations  acquisitions or dispositions  litigation or capital commitments  departures of key personnel  actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility or ethics standards by us or any of our employees  officers or directors  and negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors 
the stock market has historically experienced volatility  especially within the semiconductor industry  that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

the financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations 
results of operations overview fiscal year revenue gross margin net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations as a of revenue diluted eps from continuing operations diluted eps the year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product 
during fiscal  our revenue increased  as compared to fiscal our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was million or of revenue 
we received proceeds of million during fiscal from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and from a million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in addition  we received million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
during fiscal  we repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million  distributed million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid million for property  plant and equipment additions 
these factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal the year to year increase in revenue and profitability for fiscal was primarily the result of improved global macro economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year 
the strong growth we experienced in the first six months of fiscal  including a sequential revenue increase in our second fiscal quarter  was followed by sequential revenue declines in both the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the sequential revenue increase in the second fiscal quarter included increased inventory stocking by our customers as a result of the japanese earthquake and tsunami in march during the third and fourth quarters  of fiscal  we began to see revenue declines attributable to inventory corrections following the inventory buildup in the prior quarters and declining demand as the deficit and credit related crisis in europe and the us caused customers to become more cautious in the second half of fiscal revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market 
the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by end market can vary over time 
when this occurs  we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each end market 
during fiscal year  we consolidated the computer end market  which represented approximately of fiscal revenue  into the consumer end market  and reclassified handset revenue  which represented approximately of fiscal revenue  from the communications end market to the consumer end market for all periods presented

revenue trends by product the following table summarizes revenue by product categories 
the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products  the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications 
the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time 
in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each product category

research and development r d fiscal year r d expenses r d expenses as a of revenue r d expenses increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  increased headcount  and a general increase in spending 
these increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense  which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth

r d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future

our effective tax rate for fiscal was lower by basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal the tax rate for fiscal included the following items which caused a decrease in our tax rate the reinstatement of the federal r d tax credit in december retroactive to january   resulting in a million income tax savings  a million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve that we believe we can now recover  a million tax benefit from the increase in irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the irish manufacturing tax rate from to  and a net million tax benefit related to the settlement with the appeals office of the internal revenue service of certain tax matters for the fiscal through fiscal tax years 
fiscal also included a higher special charge  a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate as compared to the special charge recorded in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate 
in addition  higher special charges recorded in fiscal  a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate  contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal income from continuing operations  net of tax fiscal year income from continuing operations  net of tax income from continuing operations  net of tax as a of revenue diluted eps from continuing operations net income from continuing operations in fiscal was higher than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million increase in operating income from continuing operations  offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal than in fiscal income from continuing operations  net of tax  in fiscal was higher than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant

acquisitions in fiscal  we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held integrant technologies  inc integrant of seoul  korea 
the acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened our presence in the asia region 
we paid million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july through july we recorded these payments as additional goodwill 
in fiscal  we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held audioasics a s audioasics of roskilde  denmark 
the acquisition of audioasics allowed us to continue developing low power audio solutions  while expanding our presence in the nordic and eastern european regions 
we paid additional cash payments of million during fiscal for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from october through january  which we recorded as additional goodwill 
in addition  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents  we paid million during fiscal based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from october through january  which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal all revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made 
in fiscal  we acquired privately held lyric semiconductor  inc lyric of cambridge  massachusetts 
the acquisition of lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing 
the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled million  which consisted of million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to million 
the contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from june through june as of october   no contingent payments have been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately million 
we allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  resulting in the recognition of million of in process research and development  million of goodwill and million of net deferred tax liabilities 
in addition  we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of lyric products and licenses through the earlier of years or the accrual of a maximum of million 
royalty payments to lyric employees require post acquisition services to be rendered and  as such  we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods 
as of october   no royalty payments have been made 
we recognized million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal these costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
we have not provided pro forma results of operations for integrant  audioasics and lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis 
we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations as a of revenue at october   cash and cash equivalents totaled  million 
the primary sources of funds for fiscal were net cash generated from operating activities of million  proceeds of million relating to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due april  and the million term loan facility we entered into through a wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  we received million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
the principal uses of funds for fiscal were the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million  dividend payments of million and additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
these factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory days cost of sales in inventory we use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory 
accounts receivable at october  decreased million  or  from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in receivables was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal days sales outstanding decreased by two days as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal inventory at october  increased by million  or  from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support the higher revenue levels recorded in fiscal days cost of sales in inventory increased five days primarily due to lower manufacturing costs  which resulted in cost of sales increasing only from the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to a increase in inventory during this same time period 
current liabilities decreased to million at october   a decrease of million  or  from million at the end of fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income tax payable as a result of the settlement with the appeals office of the internal revenue service of certain tax matters for the fiscal through fiscal tax years 
in addition  accrued liabilities declined as a result of a decrease in accruals related to variable compensation expense 
as of october  and october   we had gross deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  and gross deferred cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by approximately million in fiscal primarily as a result of the distributors sales to their customers in fiscal exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period 
sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit  as determined by us  in order to reduce the amounts of slow moving  discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price adjustment credits to be granted to distributors  the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers 
therefore  we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers 
the amount of price adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions  and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors  there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of million 
after the end of fiscal  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on december  and is expected to total approximately million 
we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at per share  although they remain subject to declaration by our board of directors 
the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on several factors  including our financial performance  outlook and liquidity 
our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august in the aggregate  the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase billion of our common stock under the program 
under the program  we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors  the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 
as of october   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately  million under this program 
as of october   an additional million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program 
the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock 
we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options  or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans 
any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance  outlook  liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due july  the notes with annual interest payments of paid in two installments on january and july of each year  commencing january  the net proceeds of the offering were million  after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions  which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
we swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus as of october  
the variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly 
the libor based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur  create  assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property  enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property  and consolidate with or merge into  or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party 
as of october   we were compliant with these covenants 
on december   analog devices holdings bv  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na  london branch as administrative agent 
the borrower s obligations are guaranteed by us 
the credit agreement provides for a term loan facility of million  which matures on december  the terms of the agreement provide for a three year principal amortization schedule with million payable quarterly every march  june  september and december with the balance payable upon the maturity date 
during the third quarter of fiscal we made an additional principal payment of million 
the loan will bear interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of as of october  
the terms of this facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
as of october   we were compliant with these covenants 
the proceeds of this loan are being used to restructure our captive finance subsidiaries 
on april   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due april  the notes with semi annual fixed interest payments due on april and october of each year  commencing october  the net proceeds of the offering were million  after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions  which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur  create  assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property  enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property  and consolidate with or merge into  or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to  any other party 
as of october   we were compliant with these covenants 
in addition  we have a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may to date  we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance  stock repurchases  dividend payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 
the terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
as of october   we were compliant with these covenants 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  of which approximately  million was held in the united states 
the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely  this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states  including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition and our short term investments consist primarily of liquid money market funds and corporate obligations  such as commercial paper  bonds and bank time deposits 
we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties  continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  dividend payments if any and repurchases of our stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months

these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b the interest payments related to our senior unsecured notes are expected to be fully offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements 
the interest payments related to our term loan facility are based on libor plus a spread of as of october  
the actual payments will be based on the libor rate corresponding to the tenor of the interest period chosen  plus a spread of which is set two business days prior to the start of the new interest period 
c these interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus as of october  
the actual payments will be based on the libor based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the due date of the interest payments plus 
d these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment  we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
e our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables  such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
our acquisition of lyric semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration 
the table above does not reflect any such obligations  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding our acquisitions 
as of october   our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was million  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item of this annual report on form k 
due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october  off balance sheet financing as of october   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements

this standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist  how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables 
the standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory 
while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
to date  our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
to date  our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on july   we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments  which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies  which requires significant judgment by management 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
value of contingent consideration related to business combination we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates  and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above  can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made  which in turn  may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in known facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the factors described above  our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then current tax law 
significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility  we concluded that options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges  the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options  the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options  and the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes grant date valuation 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
in general  the longer the expected term used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option 
until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter s cash dividend  the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption 
cash dividends are not paid on options  restricted stock or restricted stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of october  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
contingencies from time to time  we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss 
in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments  as well as the fair value of our investments  debt and interest rate swap agreement 
based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of october  and october   our annual interest income would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase in interest rates 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of october  and october   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
as of october   we had million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding  which consisted of million senior unsecured notes  due july  and million senior unsecured notes  due april  as of october   a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our million of senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately million 
as of october  and october  a similar increase in market interest rates would not change the fair value of our million senior unsecured notes which have been hedged by an interest rate swap agreement 
any changes to fair value of the senior unsecured notes would be offset by the change in the fair value of the corresponding interest rate swap 
we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our million senior unsecured notes due july  the effect of the swap is to convert our fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three month libor plus as of october  
in addition  we have a term loan facility of million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of as of october  
if libor increases by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million 
however  this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our million of fixed rate debt  which is not hedged 
as of october   a similar basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately million to our annual interest expense 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months 
currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro  primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october  and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately million in losses in earnings or cash flows 
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions  assets and liabilities being hedged 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october   we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them 
while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 
the following table illustrates the effect that a unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates  relative to the us dollar  would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october  and october  october  october  fair value of forward exchange contracts asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
