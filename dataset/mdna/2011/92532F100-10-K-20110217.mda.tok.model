item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
in november  we submitted a new drug application  or nda  requesting approval to market telaprevir in the united states for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection 
we expect to obtain approval for and initiate sales of telaprevir in the united states in we are pursuing a number of other clinical development programs  including a registration program for vx  the lead drug candidate in our cystic fibrosis  or cf  program 
we plan to continue investing in our research and development programs and to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates that emerge from those programs  alone or with third party collaborators 
business focus we are focused on obtaining approval for and commercializing telaprevir in the united states  while continuing to advance our other drug candidates and to invest in research programs 
in january  we received priority review designation for the telaprevir nda from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  which establishes an anticipated timeframe for the fda to review the telaprevir nda that ends on may  the fda regulatory review process for the telaprevir nda will include  among other things  a detailed review by the fda of the data and information contained in the nda  meetings and frequent communications between us and representatives of the fda  and fda inspections  including inspections of clinical trial sites and third party facilities used to manufacture telaprevir 
if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  the fda could refuse to approve or delay the approval of the telaprevir nda 
if we are successful in obtaining approval for telaprevir within the anticipated timeframe  we expect to begin marketing telaprevir in the united states in mid our collaborator  janssen pharmaceutica  nv  or janssen  is responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir in its territories  including the european union  and is obligated to pay us royalties on its net sales of telaprevir 
janssen obtained accelerated assessment for its marketing authorization application  or maa  for telaprevir from the european medicines agency  or ema  in december and is seeking to obtain approval for and launch telaprevir in the european union in the second half of in order to execute our business plan and achieve profitability  we need to obtain approval for telaprevir in a timely manner and successfully commercialize telaprevir in the united states 
we expect that we will incur substantial expenses in order to seek approval for and commercialize telaprevir  while at the same time continuing to pursue diversified research and development efforts for our other drug candidates and to expand our organization 
we may seek to borrow working capital if such financing is available to us 
although we have no plans to do so in the near term  we may raise additional capital from public offerings or private placements of our securities  from new collaborative agreements or through other methods of financing  particularly if approval of telaprevir is delayed or commercialization takes longer than expected 
we cannot be sure that financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs  including clinical trials  incur significant cash exit costs  or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our drug candidates 
successful commercialization of telaprevir if it is approved will require effective marketing  distribution and pricing strategies  infrastructure to support commercial sales  appropriate and sustained levels of drug product inventory  company wide processes and systems to support compliance with 
table of contents applicable laws and regulations and post marketing safety evaluations  and an effective sales force and managed markets organization to promote telaprevir to health care providers and payors 
for longer term success we also will need to ensure that a significant portion of the hcv infected population that is currently undiagnosed is diagnosed and treated 
in  we significantly expanded our commercial organization in the united states  hiring an experienced management team and more than field based employees  preparing our initial marketing strategies  and designing and implementing the infrastructure required to support commercial sales in the united states 
we expect to complete these activities in the first half of and believe that our commercial organization will be prepared for the potential mid commercial launch of telaprevir in the united states 
we also are seeking to obtain canadian regulatory approval for telaprevir in the second half of and have started building the commercial infrastructure that will be required to market telaprevir in canada 
we expect that the market for the treatment of patients with hcv infection will be highly competitive and may initially include a hcv protease inhibitor that is being evaluated by the fda concurrently with telaprevir 
the most advanced of our other drug candidates is vx  which we are evaluating in a fully enrolled registration program that focuses on patients with cf who have the gd mutation in the gene responsible for cf 
we expect that we will receive data from the primary phase clinical trial in the vx registration program in the first quarter of if we believe the results from the phase clinical trials for vx support registration  we could submit an nda and an maa for vx in the second half of we expect that if we seek regulatory approval for vx  the submissions of the nda and maa for vx will involve a complex and resource intensive process that could be delayed 
concurrently with preparing the nda submission for vx  we would seek to establish a commercial infrastructure in europe in order to prepare for potential commercial sales of vx in international markets 
we have several ongoing phase a clinical trials designed to obtain additional information regarding earlier stage drug candidates intended for the treatment of hcv infection  cf  rheumatoid arthritis and epilepsy 
we expect to receive data from all of these clinical trials in  which should help us determine  which  if any  of these programs deserve further investment 
we believe that our longer term success will depend on our ability to continue to generate and develop innovative compounds 
to that end  we expect to continue to focus on research programs directed toward the identification of new drug candidates for the treatment of serious diseases 
drug development and commercialization discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  side effects  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never generate data that support marketing approval 
because our investments are subject to considerable risks  we closely monitor the results of our discovery research  clinical trials and nonclinical studies  and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights  with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs 

table of contents if we complete a registration program for a drug candidate and believe the data support approval of the drug candidate  we generally would submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states 
we or our collaborators also generally would seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions 
to obtain approval  we must  among other things  demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities  processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities will have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not each of our drug candidates should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease 
their review of our nda or a foreign regulatory filing could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of the drug candidate 
if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether  our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed 
we believe that by focusing on serious diseases and innovative drugs that have the potential to provide significant advantages over existing therapies  we can increase the likelihood that our drug candidates  if approved  will be commercially successful 
in addition  we believe that telaprevir will have a commercially competitive profile and that there is a significant group of patients with genotype hcv infection that may be willing to seek treatment with a telaprevir based treatment regimen 
however  we cannot accurately predict the product revenues that will be generated if telaprevir receives regulatory approval  and we may need to adjust our business plan as we obtain additional information regarding our actual product revenues 
even drugs that achieve initial market acceptance may then be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive by the introduction of additional therapies  expiration of intellectual property protections or introduction of generic competition 
approved drugs continue to be subject  among other things  to numerous regulatory risks  post approval safety monitoring and risks related to supply chain disruptions 
we will require a supply of telaprevir for sale in north america and a supply of vx for sale worldwide if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval for either or both of these drug candidates 
we rely on an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials  and we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties for the foreseeable future to meet our commercial supply needs for any of our drug candidates that are approved for sale 
third party contract manufacturers  including some in china  supply us with raw materials  and contract manufacturers in the european union and the united states convert these raw materials into drug substance  and convert the drug substance into final dosage form 
establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third party relationships 
although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain  we do not have complete control over their activities 
we have not marketed pharmaceutical products before  and prior to we had a relatively small commercial organization 
as a result  in the past many of the regulations related to the marketing of pharmaceutical products have had limited applicability to our business 
as we expand our commercial organization and prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir  we have focused on designing a comprehensive compliance program to actively identify  prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and by promoting a culture of compliance 
among other laws  regulations and standards  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims statutes 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive  or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are 
table of contents false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
in  we expect to devote substantial management and financial resources to complete the implementation of these compliance policies in preparation of the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we monitor and analyze changes in facts and circumstances that might have a material effect on our estimates and assumptions 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions  including in certain circumstances future projections  that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results derivative instruments and embedded derivatives  revenue recognition  research and development expenses  commercial supplies  business combinations  restructuring expense  and stock based compensation expense 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  including note b accounting policies  included in this annual report on form k 
derivative instruments and embedded derivatives september financial transactions expenses related to two financial transactions that we entered into in september resulted in significant non cash expenses in the two financial transactions relate to million of potential milestone payments payable to us by janssen in connection with the regulatory filing with and approval of telaprevir by the ema and million of potential milestone payments payable to us by janssen in connection with the launch of telaprevir in the european union 
in the first financial transaction  we issued secured notes due  or notes  which have a face value of million and do not carry an explicit interest rate  for million in cash 
the notes are payable in october and are secured by million of potential future telaprevir milestone payments 
in the second transaction  we sold million in additional potential future telaprevir milestone payments for a cash payment of million 
the notes contain an embedded derivative related to their potential early repayment or redemption 
the separate sale of the potential million in future milestone payments is accounted for as a free standing derivative instrument 
in order to account for the notes and the sale of the rights to the potential future milestone payments  we estimate the fair value of the derivative embedded in the notes and of the free standing derivative associated with the sale of million in potential future milestone payments 
the models we use to estimate these fair values require  among other things  estimates regarding the timing and probability of achieving the milestone events and the appropriate discount rates 
as we and janssen have obtained additional data from the telaprevir registration program and have completed various activities necessary to achieve the potential milestone events  we have updated these assumptions to reflect the increasing probability of achieving these milestone events and the expected timing of such events 
these updates have resulted in changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded and free standing derivative and corresponding expenses or gains in each quarterly period 

table of contents in  we recorded million in expenses related to the september financial transactions primarily due to increases in the fair value of the free standing derivative that resulted from the positive results we obtained from the telaprevir registration program in the second and third quarters of and janssen receipt of accelerated assessment from the ema for the telaprevir maa in the fourth quarter of in  we recorded million in expense related to the september financial transactions  primarily in interest expense 
if janssen obtains approval for and launches telaprevir in the european union  we expect that in future periods we will incur million in additional non cash expenses related to the two september financial transactions 
however  the timing of these expenses or any gains will depend on a number of factors  including factors related to the probability and timing of achieving the relevant milestone events and to applicable discount rates  and could result in material expenses or gains in any quarterly period 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
in may  we sold our rights to receive future royalties from our hiv assets and have been recognizing revenues in connection with that transaction since the date of the sale 
if we are successful in obtaining approval for telaprevir in the united states  we expect to begin recognizing product revenues on sales of telaprevir 
recognizing product revenues will require us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding  among other things  the mix of private and governmental payors for telaprevir and chargebacks  contractual discounts  rebates  returns and trade and distribution fees that we expect to offer to certain private institutions and organizations  various government agencies and or patients needing financial assistance 
up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration agreements  including the million we received from janssen in and the million we received from mitsubishi tanabe in  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur or manufacturing services are expected to be provided 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for drug candidates being developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach often has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our estimates in light of changes in the development plans for our drug candidates 
because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance have changed in the past and may change in the future 
our estimates regarding the period of performance under the janssen collaboration agreement were adjusted in  and  as a result of changes in the global development plan for telaprevir  which contemplates the conduct of certain post approval development activities 
these adjustments were made on a prospective basis beginning in the periods in which the changes were identified 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in the amount of revenues we recognized from the janssen collaboration by million per quarter for the first adjustment  by million per quarter for the second adjustment and by million per quarter for the third adjustment 
any future adjustment in our estimates of the period of performance under any of our collaborations could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee related to that collaboration are recognized 
for example  if we adjust our estimates as of january  to increase the period of performance under 
table of contents the janssen agreement by one year  it would result in a decrease in the amount of deferred revenues we recognize from our janssen collaboration of million per quarter beginning in the first quarter of and extend the period of time over which we recognize these deferred revenues 
milestone payments at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone event are substantive  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone event  as well as the level of successful effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a milestone event to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment cannot be recognized when the milestone event is achieved  but must be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
where a substantive milestone event is achieved in a collaboration arrangement  where we have no obligations remaining after achievement of the milestone and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  we recognize the payment as earned 
because achievement of a substantive milestone event under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone event often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
the milestone events that we achieved under our janssen collaboration agreement in that resulted in million in revenues were considered substantive 
there are million in potential milestone payments under the janssen agreement related to the regulatory filing and approval by the ema of an maa for telaprevir and the launch of telaprevir in the european union 
we expect that when  and if  these milestone events are achieved  the milestone events will be considered substantive and that revenues related to each milestone event will be recognized in the quarter in which the corresponding payment is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues in may  we entered into a purchase agreement with fosamprenavir royalty  lp pursuant to which we sold  and fosamprenavir royalty purchased for a one time cash payment to us of million  our right to receive royalty payments  net of subroyalty amounts payable to a third party  arising from sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase under our agreement with glaxosmithkline 
we deferred the recognition of million of revenues in connection with this sale 
in may  we began recognizing these deferred revenues under the units of revenue method 
under this method  the amount of deferred revenues to be recognized as royalty revenues in each period is calculated by multiplying the following the net royalty payments due from glaxosmithkline to fosamprenavir royalty for the period by the ratio of the revenues we received from the sale of our rights to hiv royalty payments that we have not yet recognized to the total estimated remaining net royalties that we expect glaxosmithkline to pay fosamprenavir royalty over the remaining term of the agreement 
estimating the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty requires the use of subjective estimates and assumptions  including estimates regarding the size of the potential market for hiv protease inhibitors  the competitive position of lexiva telzir specifically and hiv protease inhibitors generally with respect to currently approved drugs and drugs that may be approved in the future  and the pricing of lexiva telzir 
changes to our estimate of the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty could have a material effect on the amount of royalty revenues we recognize in a particular period 
prior to may  royalty revenues typically were recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed hiv drugs and generally were recognized in the period the sales occurred 
we 
table of contents reconciled and adjusted for differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues in the quarter any differences became known 
these differences were not significant 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded through research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in our drug candidates  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services costs and costs for commercial supply of our drug candidates  incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
commercial supplies over the past several years we have incurred significant costs related to the manufacture of commercial supplies of telaprevir 
we also are beginning to incur costs related to the manufacture of commercial supplies of vx  although these have been considerably less than the costs related to the manufacture of commercial supplies of telaprevir 
after we receive data from a phase clinical trial of a drug candidate  determining whether or not to continue to classify all of the commercial supply costs related to that drug candidate as research and development expenses or to capitalize some of them as inventory involves significant judgments 
we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for potentially initiating sales of a drug candidate when the drug candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the costs to manufacture the drug candidate are expected to be recoverable through sales of the drug 
in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventory  we evaluate  among other factors  information regarding the drug candidate safety and efficacy  the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement 
in addition  we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventory 
after we begin capitalizing inventory  we continue to monitor these factors and  if there are significant negative developments regarding the drug candidate  we could be required to impair previously capitalized costs 
while we believe that the development activities and clinical trial data to date have reduced the risks associated with obtaining marketing approval for telaprevir  we expensed all of our costs related to the manufacture of commercial supplies of telaprevir in because of the inherent risks of drug development  including uncertainty about the regulatory approval process 
we expect to begin capitalizing the costs of our telaprevir commercial inventory in we expect that most of the costs of the initial commercial supplies of telaprevir that will be available if  and when  we obtain approval for telaprevir will have already been expensed 
as a result  we expect the manufacturing costs for telaprevir included in our cost of revenues initially to be low  because most of these costs will have been recorded as research and development expenses in prior periods  and to increase as we begin to sell inventory that is produced after we begin capitalizing the costs of our telaprevir commercial inventory 

table of contents business combinations in march  we acquired virochem for million in cash and common stock with a fair market value of million 
we assigned the value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill related to the potential synergies from the possible development of combination therapies involving telaprevir and the acquired drug candidates 
the allocations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date included million of intangible assets related to in process research and development and a million deferred tax liability 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included million of intangible assets related to in process research and development and a million deferred tax liability 
the intangible assets acquired were in process research and development assets relating to the drug candidates being developed by virochem  primarily vx and vx  each of which is a hcv polymerase inhibitor that was in phase clinical development at the date of acquisition 
vx and vx had estimated fair values on the acquisition date of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we considered virochem other clinical drug candidates and determined that vch  virochem lead hiv drug candidate  had an estimated fair value on the acquisition date of million  based on development costs through the acquisition date  and that the other clinical drug candidates had no fair value because the clinical and nonclinical data for those drug candidates did not support further development as of the acquisition date 
we also considered virochem preclinical programs and other technologies and determined that because of uncertainties related to the safety  efficacy and commercial viability of the potential drug candidates  market participants would not ascribe value to those assets 
market participants relevant to the analysis of the fair value of drug candidates are third parties involved in the development and commercialization of drug candidates 
we assessed the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as in process research and development  using a variety of methods  including present value models that are based upon multiple probability weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates 
the present value models used to estimate the fair values of vx and vx required us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate  including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate  the timing of and the expected costs to complete in process research and development projects  future cash flows from potential drug sales  which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug  the number of patients that will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace  and appropriate discount rates 
the estimated fair value ascribed to vx and vx was based on the estimated fair value that would be ascribed to each of these drug candidates by a market participant that acquired both drug candidates in a single transaction 
the assumed probability of advancing vx and vx through various phases of development reflects the understanding among market participants that most drug candidates that enter phase clinical trials are not ultimately approved for commercial sale 
while  on the date of acquisition  vx and vx were each at a similar stage of development  we attributed a significantly higher value to vx than to vx because the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx research program was significantly more promising than the clinical and nonclinical data from the vx research program 
in addition  the fair value estimate incorporates our determination that a market participant would not be likely to continue development of vx unless future data from clinical trials or nonclinical studies of vx resulted in a delay or discontinuation of the vx development program 
projections of the duration and cost of nonclinical studies and clinical trials vary significantly over the life of a project depending on developments in the program over time  but in order to estimate the fair market value on the acquisition date we made the following 
table of contents assumptions from the perspective of market participants regarding the potential timing and costs to develop vx and or vx we assumed if a drug candidate were successfully developed in the united states it would take approximately five to nine years from the date of the acquisition in order to obtain marketing approval 
in addition  for the valuation  we assumed an estimate of cost from acquisition to launch to develop a drug candidate that was within a range of million to million 
future cash flows  if any  would not be generated until a drug candidate completed all required phases of clinical trials and obtained regulatory approval 
the risk adjusted discount rate for each of these projects was approximately 
virochem in process research and development assets were recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will maintain each of these assets on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired 
if we complete a project  we will amortize the carrying value of the related intangible asset as part of cost of revenues over the remaining estimated life of the asset 
if we determine that a project has become impaired or we abandon a project  we will write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and will take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs 
in order to complete an acquired research and development project  the related drug candidate must be evaluated in later stage clinical trials  which are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of pharmaceutical products 
in  we expect to obtain data from an ongoing phase a clinical trial evaluating telaprevir vx based combination therapy 
if the fair value of any of these drug candidates  and in particular vx  becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable safety or efficacy data from any ongoing or future clinical trial or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing the drug candidate  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
vx  which is considered a backup compound to vx  could be impaired by data pertaining to the potential successful development of vx  which would reduce the likelihood that we will advance the development of vx in such an instance  we could record significant charges in the period in which that data is analyzed and the determination is made 
we test the virochem intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october  and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist 
events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding a drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate  changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales prices for the drug 
in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment  we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of vx and vx are estimated using the probability weighted present value models described above  utilizing updated assumptions and estimates regarding the status of the development programs for the drug candidates  the potential future cash flows from sales of drugs  and appropriate discount rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined the fair value of vch was zero  resulting in a million impairment charge 
in connection with this impairment charge  we also recorded an adjustment of million to the deferred tax liability 
in the fourth quarters of and  we evaluated vx  vx and the goodwill related to the virochem transaction for impairment 
no impairment was found for vx  vx or the goodwill 
restructuring expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred 
the liability for accrued restructuring expense of million at december  is related to that portion of our facility in kendall square  cambridge  
table of contents massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy 
this liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of the net amount of our ongoing obligation under the kendall square lease 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of the subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated or expires  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our judgments  to reflect any changed circumstances 
stock based compensation expense we measure the compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and we recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the associated employee service period  which generally is the vesting period of the equity award  or the derived service period for awards with market conditions 
for our awards with performance conditions  we make estimates regarding the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance condition that affect the period over which the expense is recognized 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  or if the likelihood of achievement of a performance condition changes  our results could be materially affected

table of contents in and  we incurred million and million  respectively  in non cash expenses related to financial transactions that we completed in september most of these non cash expenses in related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments associated with the september financial transactions  resulting from changes in our estimates due to our receipt of positive data from the telaprevir registration program and janssen receipt of accelerated assessment from the ema for the telaprevir maa 
our costs and expenses in  and included the following in thousands stock based compensation expense restructuring expense acquisition related expenses virochem september financial transaction expenses intangible asset impairment charges loss on exchanges of convertible notes revenues comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages royalty revenues collaborative revenues total revenues our total revenues in recent periods have consisted primarily of collaborative revenues  which have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis 
this variability has been due to  among other things the july amendment of our collaboration agreement with mitsubishi tanabe  which provided for an up front payment that is being recognized over the expected period of performance under that contract  the variable level of net reimbursement we have received for the telaprevir development program from janssen  increased revenues in from services we provided to our telaprevir collaborators through our third party manufacturing network  and the timing of recognition of significant milestone revenues 
if we are successful in obtaining approval for telaprevir by may   the fda target date to review our nda submission  we expect to begin receiving product revenues from sales of telaprevir in the united states in mid collaborative revenues the table presented below is a summary of revenues from collaborative arrangements for  and in thousands collaborative revenues janssen mitsubishi tanabe other total collaborative revenues 
table of contents our revenues from the janssen collaboration in each period consisted of in thousands amortized portion of up front payment milestone revenues net reimbursement for telaprevir development costs reimbursement for manufacturing services total collaborative revenues attributable to the janssen collaboration we have not recognized milestone revenues from janssen since  but will recognize milestone revenues from janssen in the milestone event under the janssen agreement related to the filing of the maa for telaprevir was achieved in the first quarter of and is expected to result in million of collaborative revenues 
this milestone payment will be applied toward the redemption of million of our outstanding notes as is required pursuant to the terms of the notes 
in  it is possible that we will achieve one or more of the additional million in potential janssen milestone payments related to the approval and launch of telaprevir in the european union 
we are obligated to apply the proceeds from the next million of these milestone payments toward the redemption of the remaining million of notes 
the final million in milestone payments related to the potential launch of telaprevir in the european union are to be paid by janssen directly to the purchaser of these milestone payments 
we adjusted our estimates regarding the period of performance under the janssen agreement in the first quarter of due to changes in the global development plan for telaprevir  which contemplates the conduct of certain post approval development activities  including a clinical trial of twice daily dosing of telaprevir and a clinical trial in patients co infected with hiv and hcv 
this adjustment  together with a similar adjustment that we made in the third quarter of  resulted in decreases in annual revenues from the amortized portion of the janssen upfront payment 
our net reimbursements for telaprevir development costs have been decreasing on an annual basis because the proportion of the development activities that janssen is conducting under the telaprevir development program has been increasing 
the decreases in our net reimbursements for development costs have been partially offset by increases in revenues related to manufacturing services provided to janssen through our third party manufacturing network 
in the third quarter of  we entered into an amendment to our license  development and commercialization agreement with mitsubishi tanabe that resulted in a million payment when the amendment was executed 
we classified this payment as deferred revenues and are recognizing it over the expected period of performance for our obligations under the amended agreement 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenues from mitsubishi tanabe related to the million payment 
in  we also recognized million of revenues related to manufacturing services provided to mitsubishi tanabe through our third party manufacturing network 
royalty revenues our royalty revenues relate to sales of the hiv protease inhibitors lexiva telzir and agenerase by glaxosmithkline 
in may  we sold our right to receive future royalties from glaxosmithkline with respect to lexiva telzir and agenerase  excluding the portion allocated to pay a subroyalty on these net sales to a third party  in return for a one time cash payment of million 
in may  we deferred the recognition of million of revenues from this sale 
we are recognizing these deferred revenues over the term of our agreement with glaxosmithkline under the units of revenue method 
we will continue to recognize royalty revenues equal to the amount of the third party subroyalty and an offsetting royalty expense for the third party subroyalty payment 
in  we expect to recognize as 
table of contents royalty revenues a portion of the remaining deferred revenues from the sale of the royalty stream plus the full amount of the third party subroyalty 
if janssen is successful in obtaining approval for telaprevir  it will pay us royalties on sales of telaprevir in janssen territories 
janssen has obtained accelerated assessment for its maa for telaprevir and is seeking to obtain approval for and launch telaprevir in the european union in the second half of we will not receive any royalties from mitsubishi tanabe on sales of telaprevir 
costs and expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages royalty expenses research and development expenses sales  general and administrative expenses restructuring expense intangible asset impairment charges    n a acquisition related expense    n a total costs and expenses our operating costs and expenses primarily relate to our research and development expenses and our sales  general and administrative expenses 
our research and development expenses have been increasing due to the expanding scope of activities related to the development of and regulatory submissions for our clinical drug candidates and increasing investments in commercial supplies for telaprevir 
our sales  general and administrative expenses have been increasing as we increase our headcount and expand our capabilities in preparation for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
research and development expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses development expenses total research and development expenses our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drug candidates  including telaprevir and vx we do not assign our internal costs  such as salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and infrastructure costs  to individual drug candidates  because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs 
these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs  such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research  which we do allocate by individual drug development program 
all research and development costs for our drug candidates are expensed as incurred 
to date  we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
in addition  the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy 
table of contents and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
over the three year period ended december   costs related to telaprevir have represented the largest portion of the development costs for our clinical drug candidates 
we have completed the registration program for telaprevir  but expect to continue to incur telaprevir development costs in connection with seeking regulatory approval for telaprevir and conducting additional clinical trials 
we expect to begin generating revenues and cash flows from sales of telaprevir in if our registration program for vx is successful and completed on currently projected timelines  we could submit an nda and an maa for vx in the second half of our other drug candidates are less advanced and  as a result  any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for these drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change 
we cannot make a meaningful estimate when  if ever  these drug candidates  including the drug candidates we acquired from virochem  will generate revenues and cash flows 
research expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages research expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services infrastructure costs total research expenses over the past three years we have maintained a substantial investment in research activities with changes in various categories of expense resulting in a increase in research expenses in as compared to and a increase in research expenses in as compared to we expect to continue to invest in our research programs in an effort to identify additional drug candidates 
development expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages development expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services commercial supply investment infrastructure costs total development expenses 
table of contents the increase in our development expenses during as compared to is due to a large increase in our commercial supply investment and increases across most other categories of our development expenses 
the majority of the increase in our commercial supply investment was related to increasing our inventory of telaprevir in preparation for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir in mid and a portion of the increase was related to manufacturing services that we provided to mitsubishi tanabe and janssen through our third party manufacturing network 
our development expenses excluding our commercial supply investment increased by million  or  in compared to  principally due to increased salary and benefits and infrastructure costs 
we expect that we will be able to begin to capitalize our investment in commercial supplies of telaprevir during  and that as a result the commercial supply investment reflected in our development expenses may decrease significantly in as compared to our development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to primarily as a result of increased expenses related to our workforce partially offset by decreases in our contractual services expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses increased substantially in each of and as compared to the preceding year as a result of increases in workforce expenses as we prepare for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
in  our sales  general and administrative expenses increased from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
we expect that sales  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in as compared to  as the effect of the expansion of our commercial organization during is reflected in the sales  general and administrative expenses over a full fiscal year 
in addition  we expect to continue increasing the number of employees in our commercial organization and expect to incur substantial additional external costs in connection with the commercial launch of telaprevir 
royalty expenses royalty expenses decreased million  or  in compared to royalty expenses decreased million  or  in compared to royalty expenses primarily relate to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the subroyalty expense offsets a corresponding amount of royalty revenues 
we expect to continue to recognize this subroyalty as an expense in future periods 
restructuring expense as of december   our lease restructuring liability was million 
in  and  we recorded restructuring expense of million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  we made cash payments of million  million and million  respectively  against the accrued expense and received million  million and million  respectively  in sublease rental payments 
during  we expect to make additional cash payments of million against the accrued expense and to receive million in sublease rental payments 

table of contents acquisition related expenses we incurred million of expenses in in connection with our acquisition of virochem  including million in transaction expenses and million related to a restructuring of virochem operations that we undertook in in order to focus virochem activities on its hcv assets 
we did not have corresponding acquisition related expenses in or impairment of intangible assets in  we recorded an expense of million in connection with an impairment of the intangible assets related to virochem development program for vch  a drug candidate for the treatment of hiv infection 
this intangible asset was estimated to have a fair value on the acquisition date of million  based on development costs through the acquisition date 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that vch was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
non operating items interest income interest income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in compared to was the result of lower portfolio yields in periods as compared to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities yielded approximately on an annual basis in compared to approximately on an annual basis in interest income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was a result of lower portfolio yields during as compared to interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was the result of interest expense related to the notes that we issued in september and the convertible senior subordinated notes due  or notes  we issued in september  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to our notes

interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a result of a decrease in interest expenses related to our notes from million in to million in partially offset by the interest expenses in related to the notes that we issued in september change in fair value of derivative instruments in and  we recorded losses of million and million  respectively  in connection with the embedded and free standing derivatives associated with our september financial transactions 
the losses in were principally due to adjustments we made during to estimates regarding the timing and increased probability of achieving the milestones under the janssen agreement based on the positive data from our telaprevir registration program and janssen receipt of accelerated assessment from the ema for the telaprevir maa 
these losses also included time value of money adjustments to the estimated fair value of the free standing derivative 
if janssen obtains approval for and launches telaprevir in the european union  we expect that we will incur million in additional non cash expenses related to the september financial transactions 
we expect the majority of these additional expenses to be reflected as changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and a portion of these additional expenses to be reflected as interest expense 

table of contents loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes in  we incurred non cash charges of million in connection with the exchanges of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for million newly issued shares of our common stock 
the charges are based on the value of the additional  shares of common stock that we issued in excess of the number of shares of common stock into which such notes were convertible prior to the exchanges 
there were no corresponding expenses in or liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and these operating losses have been increasing over the past several years 
we have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  strategic sales of assets or businesses  financial transactions  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
we expect that we will incur substantial expenses in order to seek approval for and commercialize telaprevir while at the same time continuing to pursue diversified research and development efforts for our other drug candidates 
in  we expect to begin to receive cash flows from sales of telaprevir 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion  which was a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease was primarily the result of cash expenditures we made in related to  among other things  research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by the million in net proceeds we received from our september issuance of the notes 
capital expenditures for property and equipment during the year ended december  were million 
we had million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding on december  the notes mature on october   subject to earlier mandatory redemption as specified milestone events under our collaboration with janssen are achieved prior to october  in september  we also sold our rights to receive an additional million of potential future milestone payments that we expect to receive from janssen for the launch of telaprevir in the european union 
as a result of these transactions  the million of potential milestone payments from janssen related to the filing  approval and launch of telaprevir in the european union  if and when earned  will not provide us with liquidity in the future except to the extent that they fund the redemption of million of our notes 
in the first quarter of  a milestone event under our collaboration with janssen was achieved 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  we are required to redeem the first million of notes with the proceeds from this milestone payment 
at december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  and we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will mature on october  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
in january  we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a million revolving credit facility 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in our development pipeline  particularly in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of telaprevir and vx  and in clinical trials for our other drug candidates 
we also expect to continue to make a substantial investment in drug discovery research 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing of regulatory approvals for our late stage drug candidates  the timing and levels of product revenues 
table of contents generated by any drug that is approved  the number  breadth  costs and prospects of our discovery and development programs  and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
if we meet our expectations for approval and sales of telaprevir  we believe we will begin generating earnings as a cashflow positive company during we may seek to borrow working capital if such financing is available to us 
the million credit facility is initially unsecured  but is subject to a number of affirmative and negative covenants  including a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of more than million in domestic accounts 
if we breach any of these covenants and it results in an event of default  upon the event of default we would grant a security interest in and transfer to an account controlled by the lender cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities having a margined value of million 
the credit agreement terminates on july  although we do not have any plans to do so in the near term  we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or drug candidates
