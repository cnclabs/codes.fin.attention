item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements  the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  regulatory trends and decisions  including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  possible increased federal  state and local regulation of the safety of our operations  increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in texas  adverse weather conditions  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas  the capital intensive nature of our gas distribution business  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events  and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various 
table of contents other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  fair value measurements  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee periodically 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a cost based  rate regulated entity  which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards 
we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates 
discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities  which are subject to refund 
we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility company s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments  but they provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 
operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our 
table of contents customers 
operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential  commercial  industrial  municipal and other customers 
for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices  customer deposits and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
financial instruments and hedging activities we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk 
additionally  we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 
we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement 
the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 
changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 
financial instruments associated with commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment  our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices 
we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage  fixed price forward contracts and financial instruments  primarily over the counter swap and option contracts  in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season 
the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 
our nonregulated segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
we also perform asset optimization activities in which we seek to maximize the economic value associated with storage and transportation capacity we own or control in both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated businesses 
as a result of these activities  our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
in our nonregulated segment  we have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index  with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
changes in the spreads 
table of contents between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins 
we have elected to exclude this spot forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair value hedges 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
over time  we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
we have elected to treat fixed price forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales 
as such  these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our nonregulated segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 
financial instruments associated with interest rate risk we periodically manage interest rate risk  typically when we issue new or refinance existing long term debt with treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 
we designate these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of interest expense 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
as of september   we had no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision 
we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long lived assets is at risk 

table of contents when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
the market related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets  adjusted to smooth out short term market fluctuations over a five year period 
the use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements 
prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
within our nonregulated operations  we utilize a 
table of contents mid market pricing convention the mid point between the bid and ask prices as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement  as permitted under current accounting standards 
values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 
we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities 
fair value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved 
our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short term capital markets  which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
a further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 
amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year 
as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year 
typically  our accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline  as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills 
gas stored underground  particularly in our natural gas distribution segment  typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 
during fiscal  we earned million  or per diluted share  which represents a one percent increase in net income and a three percent increase in diluted net income per share over fiscal during fiscal  recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment and a successful regulatory outcome in our regulated transmission and storage segment offset a seven percent year over year decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a percent decrease in asset optimization margins as a result of weak natural gas market fundamentals 
results for fiscal were influenced by several non recurring items  which increased diluted earnings per share by 
the increase in fiscal earnings per share also reflects the favorable impact of our accelerated share buyback 
table of contents agreement initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and completed in the second quarter of fiscal  which increased diluted earnings per share by 
on may   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in missouri  illinois and iowa to liberty energy midstates corporation  an affiliate of algonquin power utilities corp 
for a cash price of approximately million 
the agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type  including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing  if applicable 
the closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals 
due to the pending sales transaction  the results of operations for these three service areas are shown in discontinued operations 
on june  we issued million of senior notes 
the effective interest rate on these notes is percent  after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the million treasury locks associated with the offering 
substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay million of outstanding commercial paper 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 
the treasury locks were settled on june  with the receipt of million from the counterparties due to an increase in the year treasury lock rates between inception of the treasury locks and settlement 
because the treasury locks were effective  the net million unrealized gain was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the year life of the senior notes 
during the year ended september   we executed on our strategy to streamline our credit facilities  as follows on may   we replaced our five year million unsecured credit facility  due to expire in december  with a five year million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to billion 
in december  we replaced aem s million day facility with a million  three year facility 
the reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and aem s ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased in fiscal  however  this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to million 
in october  we replaced our million day revolving credit agreement with a million day revolving credit agreement that expired in april as planned  we did not replace or extend this agreement 
after giving effect to these changes  we now have million of liquidity available to us from our commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities and have reduced our financing costs 
we believe this availability provides sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs

table of contents we reported net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended september   compared with net income of million or per diluted share in the prior year 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share compared with million  or per diluted share in the prior year period 
income from discontinued operations was million or per diluted share for the year  compared with million or per diluted share in the prior year 
unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during the current year reduced net income by million or per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of million  or per diluted share 
additionally  net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items 
in the prior year  net income included the net positive impact of a state sales tax refund of million  or per diluted share 
in the current year  net income includes the net positive impact of several one time items totaling million  or per diluted share related to the following pre tax amounts million favorable impact related to the cash gain recorded in association with the unwinding of two treasury locks in conjunction with the cancellation of a planned debt offering in november million unfavorable impact related to the non cash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business 
million favorable impact related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions 
net income during fiscal increased eight percent over fiscal net income from our regulated operations increased six percent during fiscal the increase primarily reflects colder than normal weather in most of our service areas during fiscal as well as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment 
net income in our nonregulated operations increased million during fiscal primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins 
non cash  net unrealized losses totaled million which reduced earnings per share by per diluted share in fiscal compared to fiscal  when net unrealized losses totaled million  which reduced earnings per share by per diluted share 
see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 
natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy  progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms  therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
as discussed above  the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit 
however  higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt 
table of contents expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
in addition  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or  in the case of industrial consumers  to use alternative energy sources 
however  gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately percent of our residential and commercial margins 
in may  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in missouri  illinois and iowa 
the results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations

in thousands mid tex kentucky mid states louisiana west texas mississippi colorado kansas other total fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a million net increase in rate adjustments  primarily in the mid tex  louisiana  kentucky and kansas service areas 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease due to a seven percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather this fiscal year compared to the same period last year in most of our service areas 
million decrease in revenue related taxes  primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income decreased million  primarily due to the following million decrease in taxes  other than income  due to lower revenue related taxes 
million decrease in employee related expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in the prior year 
million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
million increase in vehicles and equipment expense 
net income for this segment for the year to date period was also favorably impacted by a million pre tax gain recognized in march as a result of unwinding two treasury locks and a million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased throughput as follows million net increase in rate adjustments  primarily in the west texas  mid tex  louisiana  kentucky  tennessee  virginia and mississippi service areas 

table of contents million increase as a result of an percent increase in consolidated throughput primarily associated with higher residential and commercial consumption and colder weather in most of our service areas 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease due to a non recurring adjustment recorded in the prior year period to update the estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect base rate changes 
million decrease related to a prior year reversal of an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not recur in the current year 
million decrease in revenue related taxes  primarily due to a decrease in revenues on which the tax is calculated 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income and asset impairments decreased million  primarily due to the following million decrease due to a state sales tax reimbursement received in march million decrease due to the absence of an impairment charge for available for sale securities recorded in the prior year 
million decrease in contract labor expenses 
million decrease in travel  legal and other administrative costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million increase in employee related expenses 
million increase in taxes  other than income 
miscellaneous income decreased million due to lower interest income 
interest charges decreased million primarily due to lower short term debt balances and interest rates 
additionally  results for the fiscal year ended september   were favorably impacted by a one time tax benefit of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed a study of the calculations used to estimate its deferred tax rate  and concluded that revisions to these calculations to include more specific jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future 
accordingly  the company modified the tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes from percent to an individual rate for each legal entity 
these rates vary from percent depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity 
regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of excess gas 
similar to our natural gas distribution segment  our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our mid tex service area 
natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas 
however  natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve  which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline 
further  natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 

table of contents the results of atmos pipeline texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

table of contents nonregulated segment our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings  inc aeh  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 
aeh s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices 
in addition  aeh utilizes proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments 
as a result  aeh s gas delivery and related services margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 
aeh s storage and transportation margins arise from i utilizing its proprietary mile pipeline located in new orleans  louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana  its gas delivery activities and  on a more limited basis  for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods 
aeh also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing  through asset optimization activities  the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its subsidiaries 
we attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
this process involves purchasing physical natural gas  storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aeh has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 
aeh continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed 
therefore  aeh may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
if aeh elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas  it will execute new financial instruments to offset the original financial instruments 
if aeh elects to defer the withdrawal of gas  it will execute new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and allow the original financial instrument to settle as contracted 
we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities 
these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
aeh also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities 
changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 
due to the nature of these operations  natural gas prices and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve commonly referred to as basis differentials  have a significant impact on our 
table of contents nonregulated businesses 
within our delivered gas activities  basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
further  higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
higher gas prices  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
within our asset optimization activities  higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our nonregulated segment 
increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices  which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities 
volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities 
however  increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could cause an increase in the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september   and are presented below 
gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers  margins earned from storage and transportation services and margins earned from asset optimization activities  which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 
unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
generally  if the physical financial spread narrows  we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses 
if the physical financial spread widens  we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period

fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  realized margins for gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services were million during the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year period 
the increase primarily reflects the following million increase in margins from storage and transportation services  primarily attributable to new drilling projects in the barnett shale area 
million decrease in gas delivery and other services primarily due to lower per unit margins partially offset by a nine percent increase in consolidated delivered gas sales volumes due to new customers in the power generation market 
per unit margins were mcf in the current year compared with mcf in the prior year 
the year over year decrease in per unit margins reflects the impact of increased competition and lower basis spreads 
the million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities 

table of contents unrealized margins decreased million in the current period compared to the prior year period primarily due to the timing of year over year realized margins 
operating expenses decreased million primarily due to lower employee related expenses and ad valorem taxes 
during fiscal  our nonregulated segment recognized million of non cash asset impairment charges associated with two projects 
in march  we recorded a million charge to substantially write off our investment in fort necessity 
this project began in february when atmos pipeline and storage  llc  a subsidiary of aeh  announced plans to construct and operate a salt cavern storage project in franklin parish  louisiana 
in march  we entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third party  which provided the third party with the exclusive option to develop the proposed fort necessity salt dome natural gas storage project 
in july  we agreed with the third party to extend the option period to march in january  the third party developer notified us that it did not plan to commence the activities required to allow it to exercise the option by march  accordingly  the option was terminated 
at that time  we evaluated our strategic alternatives and concluded the project s returns did not meet our investment objectives 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an million non cash charge to impair certain natural gas gathering assets of atmos gathering company 
the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and the adverse impact of an ongoing lawsuit associated with the project 
interest charges decreased million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings 
asset optimization activities aeh monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit  before related fees  that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments 
this economic value  combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit 
we define potential gross profit as the change in aeh s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned 
this amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount 
therefore  it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income 
there is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 
we consider this measure a non gaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forward looking storage injection withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information 
this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone 
because there is no assurance that the economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the future  corresponding future gaap amounts are not available 

table of contents the following table presents aeh s economic value and its potential gross profit loss at september  and september in millions  unless otherwise noted economic value associated unrealized losses subtotal related fees potential gross profit loss net physical position bcf related fees represent the contractual costs to acquire the storage capacity utilized in our nonregulated segment s asset optimization operations 
the fees primarily consist of demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market index in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party storage assets for the positions we have entered into as of september  and during the fiscal year  our nonregulated segment s economic value increased from a negative economic value of million  or mcf at september  to million  or mcf at september  the increase in economic value was attributable to several factors including an increase in the captured spread value resulting from realizing financial instruments with lower spread values  entering into financial hedges with higher average prices and rolling financial instruments to forward periods to capture incremental value 
additionally  as a result of falling gas prices throughout the year  we injected a net bcf  which reduced the overall weighted average cost of gas held in storage 
the economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aeh actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit as of september  will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  our earnings could be adversely impacted 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  realized margins for gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services contributed percent to total realized margins during fiscal  with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining percent 
in fiscal  gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services represented percent of the nonregulated segment s realized margins with asset optimization contributing the remaining percent 
the million decrease in realized gross profit reflected million decrease in gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services as a result of narrowing basis spreads  combined with lower delivered sales volumes 
per unit delivered gas margins were mcf in fiscal  compared with mcf in fiscal  while delivered gas volumes were percent lower in fiscal when compared with fiscal million decrease in asset optimization due to lower margins earned on storage optimization activities  lower basis gains earned from utilizing leased capacity and lower margins earned on asset management plans  partially offset by higher realized storage and trading gains during fiscal 
table of contents the decrease in realized gross profit was offset by a million increase in unrealized margins due to the period over period timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal of unrealized gains into realized gains 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income taxes  and asset impairments decreased million primarily due a decrease in employee and other administrative costs  partially offset by an increase in gas gathering activities 
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity required to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources  including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities 
additionally  we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 
finally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 
we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short term and long term needs in a cost effective manner 
we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require 
during fiscal  we executed on our strategy of consolidating our short term facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line of credit  including the following on may   we replaced our five year million unsecured credit facility  due to expire in december  with a five year million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to billion 
in december  we replaced aem s million day facility with a million  three year facility 
the reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and aem s ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased during fiscal  however  this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to million 
in october  we replaced our million day revolving credit agreement with a million day revolving credit agreement that expired in april as planned  we did not replace or extend this agreement 
as a result of these changes  we now have million of availability from our commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third parties 
our million senior notes were paid on their maturity date on may  using commercial paper borrowings 
in effect  we refinanced this debt on a long term basis through the issuance of million year unsecured senior notes on june  on september   we entered into three treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes 
the treasury locks were settled on june  with the receipt of million from the counterparties due to an increase in the year treasury lock rates between inception of the treasury lock and settlement 
the effective interest rate on these notes is percent  after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the million treasury locks 
substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay million of outstanding commercial paper 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 
additionally  we had planned to issue million of year unsecured notes in november to fund our capital expenditure program 
in september  we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuance of these senior notes  which were designated as cash flow hedges 
due primarily to stronger than anticipated cash flows primarily resulting from the extension of the bush tax cuts that allow the continued use of bonus depreciation on qualifying expenditures through december   the need to issue million of debt in november was eliminated and the related treasury lock agreements were unwound 
a pretax cash gain of approximately million was recorded in march 
table of contents finally  we intend to refinance our million unsecured senior notes that mature in january through the issuance of million year unsecured notes 
in august  we entered into three treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuances of these senior notes 
we designated all of these treasury locks as cash flow hedges 
we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors

in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income  working capital changes  particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries 
the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in the prior year 
the year over year decrease reflects the absence of an million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in fiscal  primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs 
gas costs  which reached historically high levels during the injection season  declined sharply when the economy slipped into the recession and have remained relatively stable since that time 
operating cash flows for the fiscal period reflect the recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery mechanisms 
table of contents and sales 
this is in contrast to the fiscal period  where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices 
cash flows from investing activities in recent fiscal years  a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
in early fiscal  two coalitions of cities  representing the majority of the cities our mid tex division serves  agreed to a program of installing  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal   steel service line replacements during fiscal and  with approved recovery of the associated return  depreciation and taxes 
during fiscal  we replaced  lines for a cost of million 
the program is progressing on schedule for completion in september as a result of this project and spending to replace our regulated customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading risk management system  we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the mid tex division  the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in amarillo  texas  partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company s information technology data center 
the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending for the relocation of our information technology data center to a new facility  the construction of two service centers and the steel service line replacement program in our mid tex division 
cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities generated million in cash  while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  used million in cash compared with cash of million used for the fiscal year ended september  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows during the fiscal year ended september   we received million net cash proceeds in june related to the issuance of million senior notes due borrowed a net million under our short term facilities to fund working capital needs

the year over year decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal  primarily reflects the fact that in fiscal  we began to purchase shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan 
further  a higher average stock price during the second and third quarters of fiscal compared to the second and third quarters of enabled us to issue fewer shares during fiscal additionally  during fiscal  we cancelled and retired  shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired  common shares as part of our accelerated share repurchase agreement described below  which are not included in the table above 
share repurchase agreement on  july   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with goldman sachs co 
under which we repurchased million of our outstanding common stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans 
we paid million to goldman sachs co 
on july  for shares of atmos energy common stock in a share forward transaction and received  shares 
on march   we received and retired an additional  common shares  which concluded our share repurchase agreement

as a result of this transaction  beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal  the number of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the number of shares received and the million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity 
share repurchase program on september  the board of directors approved a new program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock over a five year period 
although the program is authorized for a five year period  it may be terminated or limited at any time 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts the company deems appropriate 
the program is primarily intended to minimize the dilutive effect of equity grants under various benefit related incentive compensation plans of the company 
credit facilities our short term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business 
changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 
however  our short term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months 
as of september   we financed our short term borrowing requirements through a combination of a million commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third party lenders that provided million of working capital funding 
as of september   the amount available to us under our credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit  was million

shelf registration we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that permits us to issue a total of billion in common stock and or debt securities 
the shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions 
due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the new registration statement  we were able to issue a total of million in debt securities and million in equity securities

aeh is committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 
with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
risk management activities we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and  periodically  to manage interest rate risk 
we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we use financial instruments  designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices  to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixed priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers  and we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment 
also  in our nonregulated segment  we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

table of contents we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument 
substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices

table of contents employee benefit programs an important element of our total compensation program  and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense  is the offering of various benefit programs to our employees 
these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 
medical and dental insurance we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees  and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry 
since  we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent 
in recent years  we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 
in march  president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the health care reform act 
the health care reform act will be phased in over an eight year period 
although we are still assessing the impact of the health care reform act on the health care benefits we provide to our employees  the design of our health care plans has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in fiscal for example  lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated  coverage for dependent children has been extended to age and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer 
in  health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals 
companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage 
however  companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange 
we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 
for fiscal  we anticipate an approximate percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate  primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates 
a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base  and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
our fiscal costs were determined using a september  measurement date 
as of september   interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
accordingly  we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to percent 
our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 
accordingly  our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
at our september  measurement date  the interest rates were slightly lower than the interest rates at september   the measurement date used to determine our fiscal net periodic cost 
our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 

table of contents pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
in accordance with the pension protection act of ppa  we determined the funded status of our plans as of january  based on this valuation  we were required to contribute cash of million to our pension plans during fiscal the need for this funding reflects the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during and this contribution will increase the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 
during fiscal  we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa 
during fiscal  we contributed million to our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding as established by the ppa 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal and beyond as of september   interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates  which impacted our fiscal net periodic pension and postretirement costs  were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates  we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to percent 
we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets to percent  based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation 
although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined  the impact of this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan  our largest funded plan 
due to the decrease in our discount rate and our expected return on plan assets as well as the decline in the fair value of our plan assets  we expect our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal based upon market conditions subsequent to september  the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa  we anticipate contributing between million and million to the plans in fiscal further  we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds 
with respect to our postretirement medical plans  we anticipate contributing approximately million during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
in august  the board of directors of atmos energy approved a proposal to close the pension account plan pap to new participants  effective october  employees participating in the pap as of october  were allowed to make a one time election to migrate from the pap into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features  effective january  participants who chose to remain in the pap will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits 

table of contents recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
therefore  our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 
nonregulated segment our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our nonregulated segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during
