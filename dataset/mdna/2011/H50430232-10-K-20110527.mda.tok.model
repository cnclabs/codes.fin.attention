our peripherals research and product management teams are organized along product lines  and are responsible for product strategy  industrial design and development  and technological innovation 
our global marketing and sales organization helps define product opportunities and bring our products to market  and is responsible for building the logitech brand and consumer awareness of our products 
this organization is comprised of retail and oem original equipment manufacturer sales and marketing groups 
our retail sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions americas including north and south america  emea europe middle east africa  and asia pacific including  among other countries  china  taiwan  japan  india and australia 
our oem sales team is a worldwide organization with representatives in each of our three regions 
we sell our peripheral products to a network of distributors and resellers and to oems 
our worldwide retail network includes wholesale distributors  consumer electronics retailers  mass merchandisers  specialty electronics stores  computer and telecommunications stores  value added resellers and online merchants 
sales of peripherals to our retail channels were and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and the large majority of our revenues have historically been derived from sales of our peripheral products for use by consumers 
our oem customers include the majority of the world s largest pc manufacturers 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  sales to oem customers were and of our net sales 
our video conferencing segment encompasses the design  manufacturing and marketing of lifesize video conferencing products  infrastructure and services for the enterprise  public sector  and other business markets 
lifesize products include scalable hd high definition video communication endpoints  hd video conferencing systems with integrated monitors  video bridges and other infrastructure software and hardware to support large scale video deployments  and services to support these products 
the lifesize division maintains a separate marketing and sales organization  which sells lifesize products and services worldwide 
lifesize product development and product management organizations are separate  but coordinated with our peripherals business  particularly our webcam and video communications groups 
we sell our lifesize products and services to distributors  value added resellers  oems  and  occasionally  direct enterprise customers 
sales of lifesize 
table of contents products were and of our net sales in the fiscal years ended march  and we acquired lifesize on december  based on financial measurements for the fiscal year ended march  as evaluated by logitech s chief executive officer  the lifesize operating segment does not meet the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure of financial information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
our peripherals and video conferencing industries are intensely competitive 
the peripherals industry is characterized by short product life cycles  continual performance enhancements  and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets  and price sensitivity in the oem market 
we experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less established brands  including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands  in response to declining consumer demand in both the retail and oem markets 
we may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate 
in addition  we have been expanding the categories of products we sell  and entering new markets  such as the market for enterprise video conferencing 
we remain alert to opportunities in new categories and markets 
as we do so  we are confronting new competitors  many of which have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have 
in addition  because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics  we expect greater competition in the future from well established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories as well as future ones we might enter 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we have 
we seek to fulfill the increasing demand for interfaces between people and the expanding digital world across multiple platforms and user environments 
the interface evolves as platforms  user models and our target markets evolve 
as access to digital information has expanded  we have extended our focus to mobile devices  the living room  and the meeting room  in addition to the pc  as access points to the internet and the digital world 
all of these platforms require interfaces that are customized according to how the devices are used 
we believe that continued investment in product research and development is critical to creating the innovation required to strengthen our competitive advantage and to drive future sales growth 
we are committed to identifying and meeting current and future customer trends with new and improved product technologies  as well as leveraging the value of the logitech and lifesize brands from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and maintaining market leadership 
the broadening of our product lines has been primarily organic 
however we also seek to acquire  when appropriate  companies that have products  personnel  and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
as part of our corporate strategy  we plan to increase investments in and realign resources to focus on certain market adjacencies  geographic markets or new categories  including the china market  tablet peripherals  video communications and uc unified communications  which is the integration of enterprise class collaboration and communications solutions such as voice mail  e mail  chat  presentation sharing and live video meetings 
we continually evaluate our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of current global economic conditions  changing consumer trends  and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world 
summary of financial results our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased compared with the fiscal year ended march   based on increased demand in our americas and asia pacific regions  including a strong performance in china  and sales of our lifesize products  offset in part by unexpectedly weak performance in our emea region in the last quarter of the fiscal year 

table of contents retail sales in fiscal year increased and retail units increased compared with fiscal year  with increases in all product families except gaming 
our overall retail average selling price in fiscal year declined compared with fiscal year  as unit sales of our retail products priced below increased more than other price bands 
retail sales in our asia pacific and amr regions increased and in fiscal year compared with fiscal year retail sales in our emea region decreased in the same period  reflecting a disappointing decline of in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal year the weakness in the emea region in the fourth quarter of fiscal year was due to lower than expected demand and poor execution of pricing and channel programs in europe 
oem sales increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and oem units sold increased  primarily due to increased keyboard sales 
sales of lifesize communications products were of total net sales in fiscal year in fiscal year  lifesize sales were included in our financial results from december   the date of acquisition  to the end of the fiscal year 
our gross margin for fiscal year was compared with in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the a favorable shift in product mix towards products with higher margin  operational efficiencies in our supply chain costs  and lower obsolescence write downs  somewhat offset by the negative impact of the weaker euro during most of fiscal year our gross margin for fiscal year would have been higher but for weak sales and profitability in our emea retail region in the fourth quarter 
operating expenses for fiscal year were of net sales compared with in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the addition of lifesize in december  increased advertising and marketing expenses related to promotional campaigns for harmony and logitech revue  and increased investment in areas of future growth opportunities  such as china 
net income for the year ended march  was million  compared with net income of million in fiscal year the increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales and improved gross margin  somewhat offset by the increase in operating expenses 
trends in our business our sales of pc peripherals for use by consumers in the americas and europe have historically made up the large majority of our revenues 
the increasing popularity of smaller  mobile computing devices such as tablets and smartphones with touch interfaces and the declining popularity of desktop pcs is rapidly changing the pc market 
consumer demand for pcs is decelerating in our traditional  mature markets such as north america  western and nordic europe  japan  australia  and new zealand  and we believe sales of our pc peripherals in mature markets will decline in fiscal year and potentially beyond 
we believe there are continued growth opportunities for our pc peripherals outside the more mature markets of the americas and europe 
we also believe there are significant opportunities to sell products to consumers to help make their tablets and other mobile devices more productive and comfortable 
however  we only recently introduced our product line for tablets  and consumer acceptance and demand for peripherals for use with tablets and other mobile computing devices is still uncertain 
we believe our future sales growth will be significantly impacted by our ability to grow sales in emerging markets such as china  to grow our lifesize videoconferencing division  and to develop sales and innovations for our emerging product categories which are not pc dependent  such as our products for tablets and the google tv platform 
our overall corporate strategy for future growth includes increasing our presence and sales in emerging markets  which we anticipate will be the high growth markets of the future as sales growth decelerates in our traditional  mature markets 
we are currently investing significantly in growing the number of our sales  marketing and administrative personnel in china  and we expect that china may represent one of our top three 
table of contents countries  by sales  in the future 
emerging markets include potentially high economic growth  offset by potentially entrenched local competition  higher credit risks  and cultural differences that affect consumer trends in ways which may be substantially different from our current major markets 
for the fiscal year ended march   our video conferencing segment represented of our net sales  and we expect sales from the lifesize division to grow faster than our overall sales 
our lifesize division will require significant continuing investments in product development and sales and marketing to stimulate and support future growth 
in october  we introduced our logitech revue and related peripherals for the google tv platform in the united states 
logitech revue is a companion box for google tv software that incorporates logitech s harmony remote control technology and enables google tv software to bring together the internet and the television 
we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant funds in the further development of products for the google tv platform and other tv related peripherals 
to date the google tv platform has not met widespread consumer acceptance and our sales of logitech revue and related products have been below our expectations 
however  we believe that the continued enhancement of the features and functionality of the google tv platform over time will lead to greater consumer acceptance  and our development of additional home entertainment and tv related peripherals will provide us with incremental sales over an extended period of time 
sales of our oem mice and keyboards have historically made up the bulk of our oem sales 
oem sales accounted for and of total revenues during the fiscal years ended march  and in recent years  the shift away from desktop pcs adversely affected our sales of oem mice and keyboards  which are sold with name brand desktop pcs 
we expect this trend to continue and for oem sales to comprise a smaller percentage of our total revenues in the future 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions to enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas  our technologies and our product offerings 
most of our revenue comes from sales to our retail channels  which resell to consumers  retailers and distributors 
as a result  our customers demand for our products depends in substantial part on trends in consumer confidence and consumer spending  as well as the levels of inventory which our customers  and their customers  choose to maintain 
we use sell through data  which represents sales of our products by our retailer customers to consumers  and by our distributor customers to their customers  along with other metrics to indicate consumer demand for our products 
sell through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third party nature of the data and thus may not be an entirely accurate indicator of actual consumer demand for our products 
in addition  the customers supplying sell through data vary by geographic region and from period to period  but typically represent a majority of our retail sales 
although our financial results are reported in us dollars  approximately of our sales for the fiscal year ended march  were made in currencies other than the us dollar  such as the euro  chinese renminbi  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
our product costs are primarily in us dollars and chinese renminbi 
our operating expenses are incurred in us dollars  chinese renminbi  euros  swiss francs and  to a lesser extent  other currencies 
to the extent that the us dollar significantly increases or decreases in value relative to the currencies in which our sales and operating expenses are denominated  the reported dollar amounts of our sales and expenses may decrease or increase 
in fiscal year the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income was not material 
our gross margins vary with the mix of products sold  competitive activity  product life cycle  new product introductions  unit volumes  commodity and supply chain costs  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  geographic sales mix  and the complexity and functionality of new product introductions 
changes in consumer demand affect the need for us to undertake promotional efforts  such as cooperative marketing arrangements  
table of contents customer incentive programs or other pricing programs  which alter our product gross margins 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended march  were  compared with in fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of operational efficiencies across our supply chain and a favorable shift in product mix towards products with higher margins 
our gross margin for fiscal year would have been higher but for the weak profitability in our emea retail region in the fourth quarter 
logitech is incorporated in switzerland but operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates 
a portion of our income before taxes and the provision for income taxes are generated outside of switzerland 
therefore  our effective income tax rate depends on the amount of profits generated in each of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  the income tax provisions were million and million based on effective income tax rates of and of pre tax income 
the change in the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  compared with was primarily due to discrete tax benefits of million from the expiration of statutes of limitations and the closure of income tax audits in certain jurisdictions 
we expect future effective income tax rates to fluctuate for similar reasons 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap requires the company to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of logitech s financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued in the period the company sells the product or commits to the program as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
the company grants limited rights to return product 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to stock rotation rights limited to a percentage approved by management 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information 
return trends are influenced by product life cycle status  new product introductions  market 
table of contents acceptance of products  sales levels  product sell through  the type of customer  seasonality  product quality issues  competitive pressures  operational policies and procedures and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 
cooperative marketing arrangements 
we enter into customer marketing programs with many of our distribution and retail customers  and with certain indirect partners  allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of the company s products  or a fixed dollar credit for various marketing programs 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for these marketing programs are recorded at the time of sale  or time of commitment  based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include performance based incentives and consumer rebates 
we offer performance based incentives to our distribution customers  retail customers and indirect partners based on pre determined performance criteria 
allowances for performance based incentives are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required allowances are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company s discretion for the primary benefit of end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
pricing programs 
we have agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
at management s discretion  we also offer special pricing discounts to certain customers 
special pricing discounts are usually offered only for limited time periods or for sales of selected products to specific indirect partners 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
estimates of expected future pricing actions are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical pricing actions by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  the company becomes unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio as of march  and consisted of bank time deposits  marketable securities related to a management deferred compensation plan  and auction rate securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgages 
the bank time deposits are classified as cash equivalents  and are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
the marketable securities are classified as non current trading investments  and are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices 
the auction rate securities are classified as non current available for sale assets  and are recorded at estimated fair value  determined by estimating future cash flows through time according to each security s terms  including periodic consideration of overcollateralization and interest coverage tests  and incorporating estimates of default rate  loss severity  prepayment  and delinquency assumptions when available  for the underlying assets in the securities based on representative indices and various research reports 
the estimated coupon and principal payments are discounted at the rate of return required by investors  based on the characteristics of each security as calculated 
table of contents from the indices 
the markets for the auction rate securities which the company holds as of march  and have failed since august and are not expected to resume in the foreseeable future  if at all 
four of the securities with par value of million and estimated fair value of million have experienced events of default  and two of the these four securities have declared acceleration 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products through a worldwide network of distributors  retailers  value added resellers  business enterprises and oem customers 
logitech generally does not require any collateral from its customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances are based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as the company s historical experience with bad debts and customer deductions  receivables aging  current economic trends and geographic or country specific risks and the financial condition of our distribution channel 
if management determines that a customer s accounts receivable balance is uncollectible  recognition of revenue from that customer is deferred until collectibility is reasonably assured 
as of march   one customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable as of march  a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
if any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible or if actual write offs are higher than historical experience  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could result in an increase in the company s operating expenses 
inventory valuation the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over six month periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
the write off is determined by comparison of the current replacement cost with the estimated selling price less any costs of completion and disposal net realizable value and the net realizable value less an allowance for normal profit 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech s products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  for awards granted after april  based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options and stock purchase rights is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model 
the grant 
table of contents date fair value of restricted stock units rsus which vest upon meeting certain market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation method 
the grant date fair value of time based rsus is calculated based on the share market price on the date of grant 
for stock options and restricted stock assumed by logitech when lifesize was acquired  the grant date used to estimate fair value is deemed to be december   the date of acquisition 
compensation expense for awards granted or assumed after april  is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
for share based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   share based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model reduced for estimated forfeitures  and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based compensation 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options  rsus or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
when we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits 
in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related 
table of contents statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as investments  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could require us to review an asset for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate with its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from our estimated future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired  and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we continue to maintain discrete financial information for lifesize  and accordingly determine impairment for the goodwill acquired at the entity level 
all other acquired goodwill is evaluated for impairment at a total enterprise level 
based on the impairment analyses performed in fiscal year  the fair value of each of our operating segments exceeded the carrying value of the segment by more than of the carrying value 
in determining fair value  we consider various factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods over which our assets will be utilized  and other variables 
we calculate the company s fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate to the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
logitech bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb financial accounting standards board issued asu accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  asu requires performance of an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of impairment 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  logitech will adopt asu in the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of adopting asu will not be known until the company performs its evaluations of goodwill impairment 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu specifies that  for material business combinations when comparative financial statements are presented  revenue and earnings of the combined entity should be disclosed as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
asu also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after december  we will adopt this guidance for acquisitions beginning in fiscal year results of operations net sales net sales by channel for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands year ended march  change vs vs retail oem lifesize total net sales our retail sales in fiscal year increased over the preceding fiscal year due to increased consumer demand 
the decrease in retail sales in fiscal year compared with reflected the impact of the global economic downturn  which began in the third quarter of fiscal year and continued through the second quarter of fiscal year retail units sold increased in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year compared with the preceding fiscal years 
our overall retail average selling price declined in fiscal years and compared with the preceding fiscal years

foreign currency exchange rates did not affect the retail sales decrease in fiscal year compared with fiscal year oem units sold increased in fiscal year and decreased during fiscal year compared with the preceding fiscal years 
foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly affect oem sales 
the oem sales increase in fiscal year was the result of strong keyboard and headset sales 
sales of oem mice were essentially flat in fiscal year compared with the decline in oem sales for fiscal year compared with was primarily attributable to our console microphones  which sold well in fiscal year and the first three quarters of fiscal year lifesize net sales in fiscal year represent sales for a complete fiscal year  whereas in fiscal year  lifesize net sales represent sales for the period from december   the date of acquisition  to the end of the fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rates did not affect lifesize sales 
comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal year with the same period in fiscal year  lifesize net sales increased 
unit shipments and revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year increased in comparison with the preceding year and the preceding quarter

if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  our constant dollar sales decrease would have been 
we refer to our net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as constant dollar sales 
constant dollar sales are a non gaap financial measure  which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our management uses these non gaap measures in its financial and operational decision making  and believes these non gaap measures  when considered in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  facilitate a better understanding of changes in net sales 
constant dollar sales are calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period s average exchange rate for that currency

the company s principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of its component and raw material costs transacted in cny

the primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
logitech does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
these hedging contracts mature within three months  and are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions 
gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold  at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedges by comparing changes in the spot rate of the currency underlying the forward contract with changes in the spot rate of the currency in which the forecasted transaction will be consummated 
if the underlying transaction being hedged fails to occur or if a portion of the hedge does not generate offsetting changes in the foreign currency exposure of forecasted inventory purchases  the company immediately recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in other income expense 
as of march   the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding related to forecasted inventory purchases were million million 
deferred realized losses of million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at march   and are expected to be reclassified to cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
deferred unrealized losses of million related to open cash flow hedges are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  and these forward contracts will be revalued in future periods until the related inventory is sold  at which time the resulting gains or losses will be reclassified to cost of goods sold

these forward contracts generally mature within two months 
the company may also enter into foreign exchange swap contracts to economically extend the terms of its foreign exchange forward contracts 
the primary risk managed by using forward and swap contracts is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the gains or losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings based on the changes in fair value 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at march  relating to foreign currency receivables or payables were million 
open forward contracts as of march  consisted of contracts in british pounds to purchase euros at a future date at a predetermined exchange rate 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange swap contracts outstanding at march  were million 
swap contracts outstanding at march  consisted of contracts in canadian dollars  japanese yen  and mexican pesos 
unrealized net losses on the contracts outstanding at march  were million 
if the us dollar had appreciated by at march  compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  an unrealized gain of million in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
if the us dollar had depreciated by compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  a million unrealized loss in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 

table of contents interest rates changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income on its cash equivalents and investment securities 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates from the march  and march  period end rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows
