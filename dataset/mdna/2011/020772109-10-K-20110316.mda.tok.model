or on its behalf 
special note regarding smaller reporting company status we are filing this annual report on form k as a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended because our public float the aggregate market value of our common equity held by non affiliates of the company was below the required threshold as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of as a result of being a smaller reporting company  we are allowed and have elected to omit certain information from this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  however  we have provided all information for the periods presented that we believe to be appropriate critical accounting policies the financial accounting standards board fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july  of the fasb accounting standards codification tm the fasb asc  which is also sometimes referred to as the codification or the asc 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
to the company  this means instead of following the rules in statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  we will follow the guidance in asc  stock compensation 
references to generally accepted accounting principles gaap issued by the fasb  within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report are to the codification 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb standards like sfas no 
r  share based payment  are no longer being issued by the fasb 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable  however  changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
the company determines the allowance based upon historical write off experience and known conditions about customers current ability to 
table of contents pay 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales returns  rebates and allowances sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation alpha pro tech accounts for stock based awards using fasb asc  stock compensation  asc requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 
the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes merton option pricing model and are based on the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historical data and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  years to maturity based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently has no intention to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes merton option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  the option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value 
overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments 
we accomplish this by developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of high value  disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom  industrial  pharmaceutical  medical and dental markets

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
consolidated sales for the twelve months ended december  decreased to  from  for the twelve months ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
this decrease consisted of decreased sales in the disposable protective apparel segment of  and decreased sales in the infection control segment of  partially offset by increased sales in the building supply segment of  sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the twelve months ended december  decreased by  or  to  compared to  for the same period of the decrease was primarily due to a decline in sales of disposable protective apparel to our former largest distributor 
alpha pro tech was informed in the first quarter of that this distributor had decided to launch its own  potentially competing  private label line of disposable protective apparel  and has made a business decision to transition away from selling alpha pro tech s disposable garments to its own brand of apparel 
accordingly  we have decided to shift away from our former largest distributor as the sole distributor of our critical cover protective apparel product line and to utilize a more diversified  broader  global distribution strategy 
we have sold and continue to expect to sell our apparel line to our former largest distributor but at lower than current levels 
this year s decrease was partially offset by increased sales to a broad base distribution network in particular to a major international supply chain partner with which we have achieved a preferred vendor status and from whom the company received an award for outstanding sales growth results for in our category 
alpha pro tech is a repeat winner in this category  as the company also won this award for our performance in also from this major strategic channel partner  the company received an award for outstanding delivery quality for our aggregate service level performance in alpha pro tech was also a finalist for overall supplier of the year for across all categories 
as compared to  alpha pro tech s sales to this same major strategic channel partner nearly doubled in as a result of our broader channel platform strategy th at was launched in april of  we believe that we will continue to see decreased sales from our former largest distributor  but we have aggressively grown other channels in our market space 
we anticipate that this trend will continue going forward in and will be beneficial to the company long term 
building supply segment sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by  or  to  as compared to  for the same period of the segment increase of was primarily due to a increase in sales of rex wrap housewrap and a increase in sales of rex synfelt synthetic roof underlayment 
the sales mix of the building supply segment for the twelve months ended december  was for synthetic roof underlayment and for housewrap 
this compared to for synthetic roof underlayment and for housewrap for the twelve months ended december  our rex synfelt synthetic roof underlayment  we believe  is perceived as an industry leader in terms of quality and that as the market evolves from felt paper to synthetic roof underlayment  we are in a strong position to capitalize on significant growth opportunities 
rex wrap housewrap  our high quality  multi color printed housewrap  we believe  gives us a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace and as a result  our market share is growing even during this weak building market and economic downturn 
discussions with potential and existing distributors have been very encouraging and we increased our building supply segment sales team in in anticipation of growth in the coming periods 
in addition to growth opportunities with existing products  we are also excited about the launch of our new rex wrap fortis housewrap  our icc es approved non perforated breathable housewrap 
the non perforated breathable housewrap market accounts for the majority of the total housewrap market  so our rex wrap fortis housewrap should increase our housewrap market share 
sales of the rex wrap fortis housewrap commenced in the fourth quarter of and should contribute to our growth in and beyond 
we remain optimistic about the future of the building supply segment  as our distribution channel strategy continues to strengthen each quarter

building supply segment sales comprised of total sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the same period of building supply segment sales are expected to continue to grow as a percentage of total sales in the coming periods 
infection control segment sales comprised of total sales for the twelve months ended december   as compared to for the same period of  during which we experienced significant sales of our n particulate respirator face mask due to the hn influenza a pandemic 
gross profit margin in the disposable protective apparel segment was down in the last three quarters of  as compared to the same period of our gross profit in those quarters was affected by the higher cost of inventory acquired from alternative suppliers due to our strategy of increasing inventory levels to strengthen our position in the marketplace

new accounting standards in the third quarter of  the company adopted the fasb asc 
the asc is the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  other than guidance issued by the sec 
the adoption of the asc did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
fasb asc  consolidation  asc  eliminates a required quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives an entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis

an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a cont rolling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in asu no
