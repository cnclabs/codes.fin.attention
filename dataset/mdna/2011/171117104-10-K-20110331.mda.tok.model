item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is experiencing reduced demand for furniture as a result of weak consumer confidence  lower consumer demand for residential furniture in our price segment  lower housing activity  continued high levels of unemployment  reduced access to consumer credit and the effects of the economic downturn 
additionally  sales were lower in due to the discontinuation of certain low margin products in and the globalization of the furniture industry 
we expect that the current economic environment for consumers will continue to be challenging in we have repositioned our residential furniture product line in an effort to improve profitability by introducing better value imports  utilizing a product licensing arrangement for marketing support  and replacing unprofitable and slow moving items offered in our line with higher velocity items to improve customer service 
we have moved away from a high cost manufacturing model to global sourcing with lower costs 
we continue to review and cut operating costs to be in line with our current revenue base as the company continues its business transition 
the company s new business model is expected to result in a more variable cost structure and provide greater flexibility in competing in the furniture industry 
 a prolonged economic downturn could cause outcomes to differ materially from those expected above 
results of operations the table below sets forth the results of operations of chromcraft revington for the years ended december  and expressed as a percentage of sales sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest expense  net loss before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss compared to consolidated sales in were million  a decrease from sales of million in shipments of residential furniture in were lower than primarily due to a decrease in unit sales volume  resulting from weakness in consumer demand for residential products in our price segment which we believe is consistent with industry trends and the continuing economic downturn  the results of our restructuring activities in including the reduction of slow moving and unprofitable products  and import competition 
commercial furniture shipments were higher in as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in shipments of seating products to government agencies  higher education institutions and the health care industry 

index gross margin in was million as compared to million in reflecting our transition to a more variable cost global sourcing model  lower inventory write downs and a favorable product sales mix in  partially offset by the effect of lower shipments and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead in gross margin for was negatively impacted by unabsorbed fixed overhead costs and restructuring expenses related to a plant shutdown 
total inventory write downs in declined to million compared to million in inventory write downs were recorded to reflect anticipated net realizable value on disposition 
the inventory write downs were primarily due to slow moving and unprofitable products and excess inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased million  or from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to lower professional fees  showroom rent  and bad debt expense  partially offset by higher selling expenses 
selling expenses in included payments to three former sales executives hired in for unearned commissions in conjunction with the company s initiatives to expand its product lines and customer base 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included a reduction of accrued severance benefits of million resulting from revisions to severance agreements with two former executives which reduced the amounts payable to them 
the company completed certain restructuring activities  which began in  during the second quarter of  therefore  no restructuring charges were incurred during during  the company recorded restructuring charges as cost of goods sold of million  and a net credit to selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
net interest expense  which includes bank revolving credit facility fees  was million for both and there were no borrowings under our bank revolving credit facility in or at december  and  we established a full valuation allowance against the entire net deferred income tax balance after considering relevant factors  including recent operating results  the likelihood of the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards  and the ability to generate future taxable income 
as a result  the company had an effective tax rate of zero for the income tax benefit in of million reflected the impact of a federal law enacted on november  that significantly expanded the availability of the five year net operating loss nol carryback opportunity enacted earlier in as part of the federal stimulus bill 
the legislation allowed companies of all sizes to carry back nols incurred in or to the previous five years 
as a result of this legislation  we filed a carryback return of our federal nol and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the tax refund was received in the first quarter of financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash increased by million at december  compared to december  primarily due to the receipt of a federal income tax refund in  partially offset by the cash loss from operations and an increase in inventories 
working capital  excluding cash  decreased by million in primarily due to a decrease in refundable income taxes  partially offset by an increase in inventories 
the inventory increase was primarily to mitigate stock outages resulting from delays in receiving certain products from overseas suppliers 

index investing activities used cash of million for as compared to million of cash generated in investing activities in included cash received from the sale of idled machinery and equipment from restructuring activities of million 
the company used cash of million for capital expenditures during both and in  we expect to spend approximately million for capital expenditures 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and approximately million in availability under a revolving credit facility with a bank bank facility based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
effective january   the company reduced its line of credit under the bank facility from million to million to reduce bank fees related to unused borrowing capacity under the bank facility 
there were no borrowings during and no outstanding balance at december  under the bank facility 
the bank facility expires in june and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
certain covenants and restrictions  including a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement  will become effective if availability under the bank facility is less than million 
the company did not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio at december   however  the company s availability under the bank facility exceeded million at december  and  accordingly  the covenant regarding this ratio did not apply at the end of the company expects to have availability under the bank facility in excess of million during our ability to borrow under the bank facility is dependent upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as well as compliance with the terms of the bank facility 
while we expect to comply with the bank facility  in the event that we are in default  the bank could declare all obligations then outstanding to be immediately due  terminate the bank facility extended to the company and take certain other actions as a secured creditor  which could adversely affect our liquidity and business 
among the provisions of the bank facility that the bank may consider in determining if we are in default is whether any change in the company s condition could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business  operations  condition financial or otherwise or prospects or the value of any material collateral  or whether any event or circumstance impairs our ability to repay any obligations owed under the bank facility 
if a default occurs  we could attempt to obtain a waiver from the bank  but there is no assurance that the bank would grant such a waiver 
we believe that our cash and available borrowings under our bank facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital purposes and normal capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance regarding these matters given the current state of the global economy  which has negatively impacted our ability to accurately forecast our results of operations and cash position  and which may result in deterioration of our revenues from what we anticipate 
we believe further deterioration in revenues would expose us to declining margins as a result of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing overhead  operating inefficiencies and an imbalance between our inventory levels and customer demand which would likely result in continued losses and reduced liquidity 
 additionally  if our trade creditors were to impose unfavorable terms on us  it would negatively impact our ability to obtain products and services on acceptable terms 
we have implemented expense controls and limitations on capital expenditures to conserve cash during the current economic downturn 
the company expects to borrow under the bank facility on a limited basis in 
index we will need to generate adequate cash flow from operations in future periods in order to meet our long term liquidity needs 
in the absence of adequate cash flow from operations in the future  the company may need to further restrict expenditures  sell assets  or seek additional business funding 
our ability to obtain additional funding would likely be adversely affected because all of our assets have been secured as collateral for our existing bank facility and because our financial results could adversely affect the availability and terms of any such funding 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the company requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related footnotes 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of trade receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on our analysis of customer credit worthiness  historical loss experience  and general economic conditions and trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventories for excess or slow moving items based on sales order activity and expected market changes 
if circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceeds their recoverable value  inventories are reduced to net realizable value 
employee related benefits accounting for self insured health care and workers compensation liabilities involves assumptions of expected claims based on past experience and a review of individual claims 
we establish a liability based on claim information supplied by insurance and third party administrators 
actual claim expense could differ from the estimates made by the company 
property  plant and equipment we review long lived assets for impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate the possibility that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
factors that may trigger an impairment evaluation include under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the forecast of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
if a possible impairment is i dentified  the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology 

index income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and include net operating loss tax carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we review relevant factors  including recent operating results  the likelihood of the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards and the ability to generate future taxable income to determine if deferred income taxes are recoverable and if a valuation reserve is required 
the company and its wholly owned us subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states and the states in which the company operates 
the manner in which these tax laws apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation 
therefore  the company must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position 
a tax position is recognized only when  based on management s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws  it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporti ng purposes is based on management s best judgment of the most likely outcome resulting from examination given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the company adjusts the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome 
asc liabilities for uncertain tax positions are included in other long term liabilities 
accrued interest and penalties for unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense
