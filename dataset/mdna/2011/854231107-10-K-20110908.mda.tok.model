item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group adp  engraving group  engineering technologies group  and the electronics and hydraulics group 
our ongoing strategy is to invest in the strategic initiatives which hold the greatest potential for profitable growth  and direct our resources to supporting both organic growth and acquisition opportunities 
our customer base in the food service equipment  automotive  us residential housing and general industrial sectors have all experienced difficult recessionary market conditions that have negatively impacted our sales volume 
during the second half of fiscal  we began to see an uneven recovery indicating that our end user markets had begun to stabilize  as evidenced by year over year quarterly sales increases that we have experienced in each of the past six quarters 
we are cautiously optimistic that sales levels will continue to gradually improve  although ongoing weakness in the housing sector may continue to hinder near term improvement in our adp operations 
during fiscal and  our focus had been on reducing our cost structure through company wide headcount reductions  plant consolidations  procurement savings  and improved productivity in all aspects of our operations 
these cost reduction efforts have allowed the company to significantly improve margins and increase its bottom line despite sales being lower than their pre recession peak by nearly 
substantially all of our restructuring initiatives were completed during fiscal  and we are now seeing the full impact of these efforts in our annual run rate 
in addition to the focus on cost reductions  we have improved the company s liquidity through working capital management  constraining capital expenditures to the most strategically important projects  and sale of excess land and buildings 
these efforts have provided us with the liquidity to pursue top line growth initiatives  as evidenced by the million expended on acquisitions during the year 
the four acquisitions completed during are as follows in march  we acquired metal spinners group  ltd 
metal spinners  a uk based metal fabrication supplier to the medical  general industrial  and oil and gas markets in the us  us  europe  and china 
metal spinners fabrication technology is similar to that of spincraft  which it joined as part of the engineering technologies group 
metal spinners provides the company with access to new end user and geographic markets  as well as high efficiency metal spinning capabilities and a customer base that includes global leaders in the medical device and oil and gas market sectors 
in january  we purchased sa chemical etching in durban  south africa which we incorporated into our worldwide mold tech texturizing operations 
this acquisition has the distinction of giving our engraving group a presence on six continents  further demonstrating our global capabilities to customers 
in october  we acquired the tri star brand of high quality restaurant and value series range platforms and other complementary cooking products  which provide the cooking solutions unit of our food service equipment group with a more complete product offering 
in july  we completed the acquisition of the assets of melco engraving india which provided our engraving group with a presence  and our other divisions with a base from which they can also benefit  in the strategic  rapidly growing  indian market 
we had a net debt to capital ratio of at june   and our plan is to continue to leverage our balance sheet to make accretive  bolt on acquisitions to strengthen our positions in our key end user markets and thereby enhance the profitable growth of our strategic business groups 
we also continue to focus our attention on driving market share gains in what we expect will be a highly competitive  low growth environment in our end user markets 
each of our business units has developed a series of top line initiatives that we believe will provide opportunities for market share gains which should supplement future economic growth in our markets 
these growth initiatives include new product introductions  expansion of product offerings through private labeling and sourcing agreements  geographic expansion of sales coverage and the use of new channels of sales  leveraging strategic customer relationships  development of energy efficient products  new applications for existing products and technology  and next generation products and services for our end user markets 
also  in light of commodity inflation that a number of our business units have experienced over the past months  we have a initiated a number of price increases into the marketplace in order to at least partially offset these cost increases and thereby improve profitability 
at the same time  over the past several years we have created a strong lean enterprise culture  developed low cost sourcing capabilities  and established low cost manufacturing operations in mexico and china within our business units  whereby we seek continuous improvement in our manufacturing processes  working capital management  and overall cost structure 
because of the diversity of the company s businesses  end user markets and geographic locations  management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the company  other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends 
each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to their businesses and which could impact their performance 
those units report any such information to senior management  which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the company 
a description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators kpis including net sales  income from operations  backlog  effective income tax rate  and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these kpis is included within the discussion below 
we may also supplement the discussion of these kpis by speaking to the impact of foreign exchange rates  acquisitions  and other significant items when they have a material impact on the discussed kpi 
we believe that the discussion of these items provides enhanced information to investors by disclosing their consequence on the overall trend in order to provide a clearer comparative view of the kpi where applicable 
for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on kpis  the company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period kpi calculated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the kpi calculated at the historical exchange rate for the prior period 
for discussion of the impact of acquisitions  we isolate the effect to the kpi amount that would have existed regardless of our acquisition 
sales resulting from synergies between the acquisition and existing operations of the company are considered organic growth for the purposes of our discussion 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin restructuring costs income from operations backlog realizable within year net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales growth decline net sales in increased million  or  from levels 
of the increase  million  or was attributable to organic growth  as organic sales increased across all of our segments except engineering technologies  which demonstrated historically lumpy revenues and had a difficult prior year comparison due to several large project deliveries in the increases in our other segments are a result of both improvements in end user markets and the success of our top line growth efforts 
also factoring in our growth was an increase of million  or  resulting from our four acquisitions completed during the year 
favorable foreign exchange accounted for the remaining million  or of revenue increase 
net sales decreased million in  a decrease from the prior year 
organic sales decreased million or  with a positive offset due to exchange rates of million 
the decrease was due to the fact that sales for the first half of fiscal were substantially below sales levels in the first half of fiscal severe recessionary conditions did not begin to significantly affect the company until the second quarter of fiscal sales for the second half of fiscal were higher than sales in the second half of in the engineering technologies group reported record sales due to several large projects  while the engraving group sales were flat year over year 
the food service equipment group was down slightly  and the adp and electronics and hydraulics groups continued to experience sales declines due to ongoing depressed conditions in the housing and dump truck dump trailer markets 
gross profit margin during  our gross margin was slightly down at as compared to in in  our cost of sales included million of purchase accounting related expenses during the year 
while we continue to realize the benefits of cost structure improvements undertaken since  we had higher raw materials costs during the year  especially for steel  that we were unable to overcome with price increases 
our gross profit margin increased in to from in our cost reduction actions better position our operations for higher gross margins as further macroeconomic recovery occurs 
this is demonstrated by the fact that our margins were basis points higher in than  which was our pre recession sales peak and was prior to our major restructuring efforts 
income from operations income from operations during increased million  or compared to the increase was due to improvements in both the engraving and electronics and hydraulics groups 
in the engraving group  increased volume and previous cost reduction efforts were augmented by a favorable mix of automotive platform work 
driving the increase as well was the electronics and hydraulics group  which also benefitted from increased volume combined with the impact of previous cost reduction efforts 
income from operations during increased million from income from operations included million of impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets 
this improvement reflects the impact of restructuring actions and other cost reductions taken during  as well as the partial impact of additional restructuring projects in the food service equipment and engraving groups performed during the year partially offset by reduced sales volume 
discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income taxes the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or an effective rate of  compared to million  or an effective rate of for the year ended june   and million for the fiscal year ended june  changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  the amount of the company income or loss  the mix of income earned in the us versus outside the us  the effective tax rate in each of the countries in which we earn income  and any one time tax issues which occur during the period 
our effective tax rate for is expected to be within a range of the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter  and iii a benefit totaling million as part of the deferred tax provision related to a change in the estimated state rate used to calculate the deferred balances 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by a benefit of million from the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this allowance was primarily related to foreign loss carry forwards whose recovery was assessed as more likely than not based on events occurring during the year ended june  the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii the million impairment for which only of tax benefit could be realized  as the goodwill had no tax basis  iii a benefit totaling million from the reversal of the deferred tax liability that was no longer required due to a change in the us tax classification of one of our foreign entities  iv a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter  and v a benefit related to the receipt of million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds during the first quarter 
capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in and  capital expenditures of million and million were below our annual depreciation of million and million  respectively 
in  we chose to focus our spending on acquisitions in lieu of capital expenditures  and in we focused our available cash on debt reduction in light of recessionary conditions 
backlog backlog at june  increased million from million to million when compared to fiscal  a increase 
backlog increased for the food service equipment  adp  and electronics and hydraulics groups  and was approximately flat for the engraving and engineering technologies groups 
segment analysis in thousands food service equipment compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales for the year ended june  increased million  or  from the same period one year earlier  of which resulted from organic growth 
the acquisition of tri star contributed approximately of the increase in sales 
the refrigerated solutions walk in cooler and refrigerated cabinets and cooking solutions groups grew approximately and year over year  respectively  while the custom solutions group grew net sales 
income from operations for fiscal decreased million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the positive impact of the year over year volume increase  cost reductions due to facility consolidations  supply chain cost reductions and labor productivity increases was overcome by a combination of negative product and channel mix resulting in lower margin sales  pricing pressures  and increased commodities prices  particularly for metal concentrated in our refrigerated solutions product lines 
in response to these challenges  the group is implementing multiple actions to take place in  including price increases  the integration of the newly acquired tri star manufacturing operation into our nogales facility  implementation of new growth and product diversification initiatives  and freight and metal cost reduction efforts 
subsequent to year end  we also announced the restructuring of the kool star business and additional headcount reductions to take place during the first quarter of net sales for the year ended june  decreased million  or  from the same period one year earlier 
the year over year top line sales comparisons were negatively impacted by a rollout at one of the yum brands restaurants  which generated million in sales in the effects of foreign exchange rates accounted for million of this total  and the remainder was organic decline offset by price increases 
pricing pressure offset by market share gains led to a organic sales decline in our refrigeration solutions businesses  which was impacted by the moderation in construction  and we showed a organic decline in our cooking solutions and custom solutions businesses 
despite the decline  the segment continued to grow market share through its buying group relationships and through new product offerings 
our procon business posted double digit year over year sales growth driven by strength in the beverage customer base and increasing demand from industrial customers 
income from operations for fiscal increased million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
fiscal included a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of the american associated industries aai operating unit 
we continued to see a recovery in the cooking solutions group as we are benefitting from improving market conditions  increased market penetration in key dealer buying groups and new products 
the impact of the year over year volume decreases and market pricing pressures was more than offset by cost reductions due to facility consolidations  staffing reductions  supply chain cost reductions and labor productivity increases 
with the completion of our consolidation of two cooking solutions group facilities into nogales  mexico  during the year  the beginning of marked the full run rate of our initiatives from the last two years 
air distribution products compared to compared to change change net sales income loss from operations n a n a operating income margin net sales for the fiscal year ended june  improved or million  due to market share gains  increased new product sales and a market driven price increase of to during the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in general sales activity resulting from a further deterioration in housing starts during the year 
the price increase was not effective until the second part of the fourth quarter  and we expect to see its full benefit in adp continues to pursue market share gains through its traditional channels by increasing market penetration at existing and new wholesaler accounts  emphasizing our ability to service nationwide wholesalers and large do it yourself retailers through our network of factory locations  and by working in conjunction with our wholesalers to target contractor business 
adp s sales initiatives resulted in the addition of over new branches of existing customers each branch being independent in their choice of supplier compared to the same period a year ago 
the introduction of several new product lines also contributed to the year over year growth in volume 
since december  housing starts in the us  after a precipitous decline over the prior three years  have remained within a narrow band of historically low annualized starts 
as such  sales continue to remain depressed with slight variances from quarter to quarter 
a slight increase in adp s total unit volume of compared to despite housing start deterioration within this narrow band indicates that our efforts are successfully increasing the top line via market share 
income from operations for the year ended june  improved million to a loss of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
material costs were approximately million higher than in  primarily because of increased metal costs 
material increases and inflationary increases were mostly offset by lower administrative spending  improved freight costs achieved through vendor management and other cost reduction measures 
improved price on manufactured products and additional sales of adjacent products provided the balance of the year over year improvement in earnings 
net sales for the fiscal year ended june  declined or million from pricing declined and sales unit volume was lower by 
income from operations for the year ended june  decreased million to a loss of million as compared to pricing declines  totaling million  and lower volume were the most significant reasons for the change in earnings 
metal costs were million less than fiscal  million of which was the result of a lower of cost or market charge recorded in the third quarter of decreases in hourly and salaried workforces implemented in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  lower workers compensation costs and lower distribution costs comprised the majority of the remaining offset to price and volume declines 
engraving compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the engraving group increased from levels at million compared to million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million in fiscal year our roll plate and machinery equipment sales continue to experience a soft market due to lower capital spending budgets at our customers 
increased quotation activity has not yet translated to an increase in firm orders 
we are  however  anticipating new business in related to new cigarette packaging requirements in the united states 
our mold texturizing businesses continue to strengthen based on the release of new automotive programs  which also creates an improved product mix due to their generally higher margins 
we expect this trend to continue into  and will continue to grow this business through further expansion into emerging markets  including a planned expansion of our pune  india  facility and the opening of an additional mold texturizing facility in china during we believe that global presence and proximity to our customers  as well as our technology and responsiveness to automotive oem customers needs  will allow us to remain the number one choice for their texturing services 
income from operations increased by million  or  when compared to restructuring of the business and significant cost reduction efforts implemented in  as well as headcount reductions in our european operations in  were significant in the improvement of operating income year over year 
with our new lower cost structure and focus on growth  we demonstrated our ability to improve income from operations on flat sales in in  we demonstrated that we have favorably leveraged sales growth and further improved our operating performance 
in addition  the group continues to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques and develop and globalize market leading technology in order to further improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
net sales in the engraving group were flat from levels at million compared to million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million in fiscal year while our roll plate and machinery equipment sales continued to experience a soft market due to tight capital spending budgets at our customers  our innovent division s sales increased  showing the benefit of our expansion and broadening of our focus from tools to technology driven system solutions 
releases of new automotive programs continued to drive strengthening in the mold texturizing business 
income from operations in increased by million  or  when compared to restructuring the business and significant cost reduction efforts implemented in  as well as headcount reductions in our european operations  were significant in the improvement of operating income year over year 
with our new lower cost structure and focus on growth  we have demonstrated our ability to improve income from operations on flat sales  and we anticipate that we will be able to favorably leverage future sales growth and further improve our operating performance 
in addition  the group continues to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques and develop cutting edge technology throughout its operations in order to further improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
engineering technologies compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the fiscal year increased million or  when compared to the prior year 
the increase is a result of the acquisition of metal spinners group  which increased sales 
negative organic growth of occurred as increases in the aviation and defense segments at spincraft were more than offset by declines in the energy and aerospace markets 
we expect the energy business to be down year over year in first half of fy as one of our major customers implements an inventory correction and then strengthen in the second half of the fiscal year 
in the aerospace segment  we anticipate an increase over our run rate particularly in the second half of the fiscal year for hardware to supply unmanned launch vehicles for the next three to five years of government and commercially funded satellite launches 
we also expect to see further benefit from the metal spinners acquisition  where we are committing to a major capacity expansion to support expected new business in the oil and gas market 
for the fiscal year ending june   income from operations decreased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this decrease was driven by the energy and aerospace sales volume reductions at spincraft and the effect of million of purchase accounting and other acquisition related costs from the metal spinners acquisition 
overall  the transition at metal spinners is proceeding according to expectations  and we expect metal spinners to be accretive in net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses continued to experience strong demand across its energy  aerospace  missile  aviation  and marine end user markets 
we completed contracts related to nasa hardware for the ares and orion programs 
in addition  we secured new aerospace and tank hardware contracts during the year 
income from operations increased by million or in fiscal  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the increase was primarily due to growth with several aerospace launch vehicle customers 
a favorable product mix  cost cutting initiatives  and improved manufacturing efficiencies also contributed to the performance 
electronics and hydraulics compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin sales for the group increased million  or  in when compared to sales for the electronics unit in were million  an increase of million  or  over sales of million 
this increase is due to improved market conditions in our end user markets and market share gains resulting from our top line organic growth initiatives 
we have moved into new regions  products  and markets by adding new internal and third party sales representatives in the united states  europe and asia 
we are in a unique position relative to our competition  as we are able to provide engineering expertise on a global basis combined with the low cost manufacturing from our facilities located in mexico and china 
our north american based competition typically cannot offer the same low cost manufacturing position and competitors located in china cannot provide the same level of new product and application engineering capability 
the hydraulics unit had sales of million  an increase of million  or  compared to sales of million 
business in the domestic dump truck and dump trailer markets has started to improve due to increases in coal mining  requirements for aggregate  and the replacement of aging equipment by municipalities 
our diversification efforts in the chinese domestic market  as well as sales into southeast asia  australia  central america and south america  are contributing to the increase 
our efforts to diversify our sales into alternative markets such as oil gas and refuse vehicles have also assisted in the turnaround 
income from operations during increased million  or compared to at the electronics unit  improved pricing and productivity improvements allowed us to continue to leverage volume at our low cost facilities in mexico and china 
income from operations for electronics increased million from million in to million in  a gain of 
meanwhile  the increase in sales at hydraulics has had a dramatic positive impact on income due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives taken in income from operations from hydraulics was million  an increase of million  or  from income from operations of million 
net sales for the electronics and hydraulics segment decreased million  or  when compared to although sales were down year over year  sales in the second half of the year were up driven by improvements in the automotive  appliance  computer  toy and security markets for our electronics unit 
sales were also buoyed by the reed switch product line  where sales increased year over year  and by significant new business in the medical  hvac  and toy switch markets 
for the full year  the electronics unit posted sales of million  a decrease of million  or  from sales of million 
sales at our hydraulics unit continued to be plagued by depressed market conditions in the domestic and international dump truck trailer sectors due to a lack of available credit to customers  as well as a high inventories in the used equipment market 
hydraulics unit sales in were million  a decrease of million  or from million of sales in income from operations for increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
during  we took aggressive measures to reduce our cost structure  including plant closures and workforce reductions 
as a result  the electronics unit showed a basis point increase in operating margin year over year 
electronics income from operations in was million  an increase of million  or  over million in despite significantly lower sales  the hydraulics unit  where we reduced our workforce by over  also showed an increase in operating income to million  an improvement of million  or compared to million in both these improvements reflect the full year impact of our restructuring efforts 
corporate  restructuring and other compared to compared to change change income loss from operations corporate gain on sale of real estate n a restructuring corporate expenses in increased million  or as compared to during  we incurred million of expenses related to the four acquisitions during the year  including legal and administrative costs and investment banking fees 
corporate expenses in increased million  or compared to this increase was primarily due to expenses for bonuses and stock compensation expenses that were not accrued in due to austerity measures taken in the face of the recession 
in  the company recorded a gain of million from the sale of an excess facility in lyon  france  that was the site of a former engraving group operation 
the company recorded a gain of million during related to the sale of its corporate headquarters facility in salem  new hampshire 
during we relocated our headquarters to a leased facility in salem that is smaller and more suited to our current operational needs 
restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the company s efforts to continuously improve operational efficiency and expand globally in order to remain competitive in the end user markets we serve 
each year the company incurs costs for actions to size its businesses to a level appropriate for current economic conditions and to improve its cost structure for future growth 
restructuring expenses result from numerous individual actions implemented across the company s various operating divisions on an ongoing basis and include costs for moving facilities to best cost locations  starting up plants after relocation  curtailing downsizing operations because of changing economic conditions  and other costs resulting from asset redeployment decisions 
shutdown costs include severance  benefits  stay bonuses  lease and contract terminations and asset write downs 
in addition to the costs of moving fixed assets  start up and moving costs include employee training and relocation 
vacant facility costs include maintenance  utilities  property taxes  and other costs 
during the company incurred restructuring expense of million 
the majority of these expenses related to the continuation of three initiatives begun in the relocation of our dallas food service equipment group manufacturing operations to nogales  mexico  the movement of our mississippi adp facility to the vacated dallas plant  and headcount reductions in our european engraving operations 
we also incurred additional expenses in the food service equipment group as we began integrating tri star into our nogales facility and consolidated customer service functions for the cooking solutions businesses 
during  the company incurred restructuring expense of million related to both headcount reductions and a strategic realignment of our manufacturing footprint 
this expense consisted primarily of million of restructuring costs in the food service equipment group  for the aforementioned dallas consolidation into nogales 
expense of million was incurred in the european operations of the engraving group  where we closed one facility in addition to reducing headcount across the continent  and in our adp group  where the costs of a facility move were offset by the settlement of the multi employer pension liability at the bartonville  illinois adp facility  which was closed in july the company currently expects to incur between and million of restructuring expense in  including the costs to complete actions initiated before the end of and actions anticipated to be approved and initiated during discontinued operations in  the company sold substantially all the assets of the berean christian stores berean business in an all cash deal resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of million 
as the former owner of berean  the company is party under a number of operating leases which were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the leases at the stated lease costs 
the company remained an obligor of these leases until the expiration of the initial terms 
in the second quarter of  noting berean s deteriorating operating performance and precarious financial position  the company recorded liabilities of million  net of estimated subleases  in anticipation of the impairment of leases remaining under the obligation 
in june  berean filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and  in july  its assets were sold to a third party under section of the code 
the new owner of the berean assets has infused capital into the business  and we believe the berean bookstores can now be operated successfully as a going concern 
as part of this transaction  the company agreed to provide lease supplement payments to the new owner of the berean assets 
these payments included an upfront payment of million and additional payments totaling million which will be made in equal monthly installments through december the company will remain an obligor of the leases assumed by the new owner  however  our obligation has been reduced for locations where the new owner was able to obtain rent concessions 
in addition  the company remains responsible for two sites formerly operated by berean 
liabilities associated with these two leases  net of expected subleases at current market rates  total million at june  subsequent to these transactions  the aggregate amount of our obligations in the event of default is million at june  during  the company entered into an administrative order of consent with the us environmental protection agency epa related to the removal of various pcb contaminated materials and soils at a site where the company leased a building and conducted operations from the company established an accrual of million related to the matter in and an additional million accrual in remediation efforts were substantially completed during the third quarter of  and the company received a closure letter from the epa in the first half of the company actively sought the recovery of costs incurred in carrying out the terms of the aoc through negotiations with its legacy insurers 
based on the status of these negotiations at september   the company determined that a settlement was probable and recorded million million net of tax in discontinued operations during the first quarter of as expected  the settlement came to fruition during the second quarter of  with a final recovery of million million net of tax  net of costs incurred to negotiate the settlement 
the following table summarizes the company s discontinued operations activity  by operation  for the years ended june   and in thousands division disposed of year disposed berean christian bookstores club products and monarch aluminum other loss from discontinued operations income loss before taxes from discontinued operations provision benefit for tax net income loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the same period in items which positively impacted cash flow as compared to the prior year were an increase in net income of million  a change in taxes payable of million  and the impact of million in voluntary pension contributions during the improvement was offset by an increase in working capital during the year of million 
investing activities consumed million of cash during  consisting primarily of million for four acquisitions during the year 
we used million for capital expenditures  and an additional million of cash was generated from the aforementioned sale of real estate 
during the year ended june   we used million of cash for financing activities 
in addition to reducing our funded debt by million  we also repurchased million of treasury stock during the year under previously existing programs 
capital structure we have in place a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with seven participating banks which originated in september funds available under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of june   the effective rate of interest for outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
we are required to pay an annual fee of on the maximum credit line 
since  the company has undertaken a series of initiatives to generate cash and reduce debt  including cost reductions  improved working capital management  and plant consolidations 
these initiatives have enabled us to pay down substantially all of our private placement debt and generate substantial debt capacity in order to fund strategic acquisitions 
as of june   we had borrowings of million under our facility 
we believe that the remaining million available provides us with sufficient capacity to meet both our short and long term liquidity needs 
our facility also allows for up to million of private placement debt in addition to our revolving borrowings 
our funded debt agreements contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants  as well as specific financial covenants 
the company s current financial covenants under the facility are as follows interest coverage ratio the company is required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes  as adjusted adjusted ebit per the credit agreement  to interest expense for the trailing twelve months of at least adjusted ebit per the credit agreement specifically excludes extraordinary and certain other defined items such as non cash restructuring charges and goodwill impairment 
at june   the company s interest coverage ratio was leverage ratio the company s ratio of funded debt to trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda per the credit agreement  calculated as adjusted ebit per the credit agreement plus depreciation and amortization  may not exceed at june   the company s leverage ratio was consolidated net worth the company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million plus of cumulative net income since the inception of the agreement 
consolidated net worth is defined as the company s net worth as adjusted for unamortized pension losses not to exceed million and certain foreign exchange gains and losses 
at june   the company s consolidated net worth was million  million greater than the required amount of million 
we also utilize two uncommitted money market credit facilities to help manage daily working capital needs 
these unsecured facilities  which are renewed annually  provide for a maximum aggregate credit line of million 
amounts outstanding under these facilities were million and zero at june  and  respectively 
at june   and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding  primarily for insurance purposes  of million and million  respectively 
through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec  depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets  we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series  which may consist of notes  debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 
in addition to day to day operating needs  our primary cash requirements include interest and mandatory principal payments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the facility 
we expect to spend million on capital expenditures during  and expect that depreciation and amortization expense for the year will be approximately million and million  respectively 
in june  we entered into million of five year floating to fixed rate swaps 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
in anticipation of future borrowings to fund organic growth and acquisitions  we have also entered into three forward dated swaps totaling million that will become effective in september and march to take advantage of the current interest rate market 
once these forward dated swaps become effective  our weighted average base borrowing rate on the swapped portion of our debt will be 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of net income of million 
also affecting equity were dividends of million  favorable foreign currency movements of million and unrealized pension gains of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to treasury stock activity  offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock based compensation in the current year 
the company net debt to capital percentage improved from to in due to continued debt reduction  the contribution of current year net income to retained earnings  and the aforementioned changes to accumulated other comprehensive income 
we sponsor a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s pension plan for us salaried employees was frozen as of december  participants in the us salaried pension and supplemental defined benefit plans no longer accrue future benefits 
the fair value of the company us pension plan assets was million at june  and the projected benefit obligation in the us was million at that time 
as a result of voluntary contributions made in  the company estimates  based on current pension protection act and other funding rules  that we will not incur a mandatory funding requirement until we do not expect contributions to our other defined benefit plans to be material in we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of our defined benefit and defined contribution plans as of june  our operating cash flows from continuing operations and available liquidity are expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing regulations 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was million and million at june  and  respectively 
during  the company withdrew million of excess funding from these policies with no related tax consequences 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest payments post retirement benefit payments other total estimated interest payments are based upon effective interest rates as of june   and include the impact of interest rate swaps 
see item a for further discussions surrounding interest rate exposure on our variable rate borrowings 
post retirement benefit payments are based upon current benefit payment levels 
lease supplement payments to berean christian stores endeavor  llc 
at june   we had million of non current liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future payments related to these obligations 
off balance sheet items in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores completed in august  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
during june  the berean business filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the berean assets were subsequently resold under section of the code 
the new owners of the berean business have negotiated lower lease rates and extended lease terms at certain of the leased locations 
we remain an obligor on these leases  but at the renegotiated rates and to the original term of the leases 
the aggregate amount of our obligations in the event of default is million at june   of which million is not recorded on our balance sheet as a liability based on management s assessment of the likelihood of loss 
we had no other material off balance sheet items at june   other than the operating leases summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the pound sterling  peso  and euro have experienced increases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by  the pound has appreciated by  and the peso has appreciated by all relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into non us dollars at the end of the current year 
environmental matters during  the company entered into an administrative order of consent with the us environmental protection agency related to the removal of various pcb contaminated materials and soils at a site where the company leased a building and conducted operations from see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this event 
we are party to various other claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to our business 
we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these other matters will have a material effect on our financial statements 
seasonality we are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality  however our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of activity 
employee relations the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
we renegotiated two union contracts during  and in each case reached an agreement 
a total of five union contracts covering approximately employees will expire in the company maintains good working relations with all of its unions  however  there can be no guarantee that agreements can be reached in future negotiations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectability of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount of the asset 
the company s annual test for impairment is performed using a may st measurement date 
we have identified our reporting units for impairment testing as our twelve operating segments  which are aggregated into our five reporting segments as disclosed in note industry segment information 
the test for impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model income approach 
this method uses various assumptions that are specific to each individual reporting unit in order to determine the fair value 
in addition  the company compares the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its overall market capitalization 
our annual impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions surrounding general market conditions  short term growth rates  and a terminal growth rate of  and detailed management forecasts of future cash flows prepared by the relevant reporting unit 
fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis would not result in the identification of any impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  changes in assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
the most significant assumption involved in the company s determination of fair value is the cash flow projections of each reporting unit 
certain of our reporting units have been significantly impacted by the current global economic downturn  specifically the air distribution products group  which has been significantly impacted by the declines in new housing starts and other factors impacting residential housing 
if the effects of the current global economic environment are protracted or the recovery is slower than we have projected estimates of future cash flows for each reporting unit may be insufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  requiring the company to re assess its conclusions related to fair value and the recoverability of goodwill 
as a result of our annual assessment  the company determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
therefore  no impairment charges were recorded during and cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of in the us is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
the us discount rate of reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point change in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a twenty five basis point basis point change in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
business combinations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
during this measurement period  the company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the new guidance does not extend the use of fair value accounting  but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within gaap or international financial reporting standards ifrss 
the new guidance also changes the wording used to describe many requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements and it clarifies the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurements 
the new guidance applies prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on july  we do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both cases  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
regardless of the method used  the entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the new guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of this new guidance on july  we do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan and non qualified defined contribution plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk we are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
the transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts 
we also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
the contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend payments  loan payments  and materials purchases  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and  the fair value of the company s open foreign exchange contracts were not material 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling  and chinese yuan 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the us dollar at june   would not result in a material change in our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s effective rate on variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement decreased from at june  to at june  our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
in june  we entered into million of five year floating to fixed rate swaps 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
due to the impact of the swaps  an increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense at june  concentration of credit risk we have a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
the adp  engineering technologies  food service equipment and electronics and hydraulics groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
in the past year  we have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including steel  copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
