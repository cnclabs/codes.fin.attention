item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in asc topic  segment reporting formerly sfas no 

our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of states budgets which is exacerbated by the economic downturn 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will place primary emphasis on the development of our home health operations 
as our business grows we may evaluate opportunities for the provision of other health care services in patients homes that would be consistent with our senior advocacy mission 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers  through the startup of new agencies and potentially by providing new services in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 

table of contents health care reform legislation and medicare regulations on march   president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  and on march   the president signed the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of these acts are collectively referred to below as the legislation 
many of the provisions of the legislation do not take effect for an extended period of time and most will require the publication of implementing regulations and or the issuance of programmatic guidelines 
among other things  the legislation as it currently exists reduces medicare reimbursement rates for home health care services we provide to our patients 
while implications on rates for years appear clear  implications on rates are significantly less clear for years in which the rebasing described below is to occur 
imposes new requirements on employer sponsored health plans including expanding eligibility of employees and dependants  which may increase the cost of providing such benefits 
includes enhanced program integrity provisions  provider billing limitations  provider overpayment notification requirements and overpayment recoupment capabilities for the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
includes a number of other provisions that could reasonably be expected to have an impact on our business 
recently a number of efforts have been made by certain members of congress to repeal or otherwise slow implementation 
also  there have been a number of court cases filed challenging the legality of the legislation on constitutional and other grounds 
in our view it is reasonable to expect these activities to continue to occur over the next few years 
additionally  very often  sweeping new legislation is followed by subsequent legislation to address previously unanticipated consequences  or to further define provisions that were too vague to implement based on the language of the original legislation 
as a result of the broad scope of the legislation  the significant changes it will effect in the healthcare industry and society generally  and the complexity of the technical issues it addresses  we are unable to predict  at this time  all the ramifications the legislation and the implementing regulations may have on our business as a health care provider or a sponsor of an employee health insurance benefit plan 
the legislation and implementing regulations and programmatic guidelines could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition in ways not currently anticipated by us 
additionally  we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any or all of the negative implications of the legislation and implementing regulations or programmatic guidelines 
some of the more significant changes to home health reimbursement included in the legislation  as it currently exists  are as follows a market basket update reduction of per year in each of   and which will reduce our annual cost inflation updates 
cms market basket updates are to reflect price inflation experienced by health care providers 
a rural rate add on effective april  through december approximately of our medicare patients live in rural areas 
a outlier cap which limits the amount of outlier reimbursement a provider may receive to of total reimbursement 
less than of our revenue would be considered outlier reimbursement 
home health agencies receive additional or outlier payments for day home health episodes of care which carry unusually high costs 
a rebasing of rates phased in over four years from through these provisions require cms to recalculate or rebase home health reimbursement to more closely align with the costs of providing care 
any reduction in reimbursement rates resulting from rebasing cannot exceed per year in each of the four phase in years 
there are certain requirements for the medicare payment advisory commission medpac and the hhs secretary to assess and report on the impact of rebasing on access and quality of care 
home health reimbursement rates have not been rebased since the inception of the prospective payment system in october  accordingly  we cannot predict the impact this rebasing work may have when it is completed three years from now 
beginning in  an annual productivity adjustment  estimated to result in a per year payment reduction 

table of contents broader policy changes are contained in the health care reform legislation  that seek to expand access to affordable health insurance 
the legislative changes will affect provider operations in addition to payments 
for example  the legislation includes a requirement that physicians ordering home health services document a face to face encounter with the patient 
the legislation also includes a number of pilot programs  demonstration projects and studies  the results of which could lead to alternative health care delivery and payment systems 
the president is charged with appointing a member independent medicare advisory board imab empowered to recommend changes to the president and congress to reduce the growth of medicare spending 
with limited exceptions  congress is required to implement the imab s proposals to achieve savings 
an exception exists if congress adopts alternative proposals resulting in an equivalent level of savings 
independent of the legislation  cms when establishing medicare rates for included a market basket update rate increase of plus a outlier policy adjustment minus a case mix creep adjustment 
independent of the legislation  in march  the medicare payment advisory commission medpac issued its annual report to the congress on medicare payment policy in which it makes specific recommendations for payment policy changes for all categories of providers including home health 
its recommendations for regarding home health include elimination of the market basket update  consideration of stronger program controls including some that may impact how rebasing is implemented  and a study to identify categories of patients who are likely to receive the greatest benefit from home health care 
additionally  medpac is expected to release  in march  additional recommendations for changes to home health reimbursement for we are unable to predict what those recommendations may be 
 additionally  we are unable to predict whether  or in what form  the congress or cms might implement medpac s recommendations 
it is reasonable to expect that the legislation might have a more immediate and negative impact on those providers generating lower margins than us  with more leverage relative to earnings than us  with less capital resources than us  or with less ability to adapt their operations 
certain aspects of the legislation appear to align with certain recommendations of the medicare payment advisory commission medpac 
medpac suggests  in connection with its recommendation for a rebasing or recalculation of home health reimbursement rates that such change may result in some agencies exiting medicare 
based on this and our own interpretation of the potential implications of such a rebasing we believe that the legislation may result in a contraction of the number of home health providers 
in the even t of such a contraction in the number of providers  we believe the surviving providers may benefit from a higher rate of admissions growth than would have otherwise occurred 
those surviving providers may earn incremental margins on those higher admissions that may serve to offset a portion of the rate reduction from the medicare program 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting such higher admissions 
it is also reasonable to expect that the rate cuts  if enacted as presently outlined  will present additional opportunities for us to make acquisitions of other providers at valuations and on terms that are attractive to us and enable us to spread our segment and unallocated corporate overhead expenses across a larger business base 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making such acquisitions 
in november  cms released final revisions to medicare home health reimbursement rates and regulations for among other changes  the rules include a market basket update rate increase of  less from the legislation  minus the outlier provision  less a case mix creep adjustment for an effective rate cut of approximately regulations implementing a requirement included in the legislation for a face to face encounter between the patient and the physician ordering home health services regulations intended to address concerns over therapy utilization by requiring additional documentation justifying therapy visits based on specific goals  accepted standards of care  and objective and quantifiable measures of patients progress towards those goals revisions to its previously issued month rule which limits the sale or transfer of the medicare provider agreement for any medicare certified home health agency that has been in existence for less than months or that has undergone a change of ownership in the last months 
this month rule limitation may reduce the number of home health agencies that otherwise would have been available for acquisition and may limit our ability to successfully pursue our acquisition strategy 
the final rules became effective january  
table of contents there has been a great deal of legislative and regulatory change enacted or proposed in the last several months and  as indicated above  not all implementing regulations have been published 
additionally  as also indicated above it is reasonable to expect more changes 
management is currently working to evaluate the implications of these changes and to develop appropriate courses of action for the company 
given the broad and far reaching implications of all these changes  the incomplete nature of these changes  the pace at which the changes are taking place and the prospects for future changes to be made  we cannot predict the ultimate impact  which may be material and adverse  that health care reform efforts and resulting medicare reimbursement rates will have on our liquidity  our results of operation  the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets including goodwill or our financial condition 
further  we are unable to predict what effect  if any  such material adverse effect  if it were to occur  might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility 
we may contemplate formulating and taking actions intended to mitigate or otherwise offset some of the negative effects of the reimbursement changes 
these actions may include any or all of the following attempting to increase our revenues by investing more resources in sales and marketing activities  development of diagnosis related specialty programs and increasing our educational programs regarding the value of home health to drive admission growth  establishing startup branch operations to expand our service territories  and acquisitions of underperforming providers with strong referral relationships  attempting to reduce our costs by developing a more efficient delivery model  increasing the productivity standards for our staff  optimizing the appropriate use of different levels of professional staff  limiting or eliminating the growth in wage rates  limiting or reducing the size of our work force  closing unprofitable branch operations and accelerating our efforts to evaluate the use of various technological approaches to the delivery of patient care to improve patient outcomes and or improve the productivity of our workforce  evaluating the potential implications of health care reform on our employee benefit plans  and possible changes we may need to make to our plans  and potentially other actions we deem appropriate including evaluation of potential additional service offerings in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission or changing the mix of the types of services we provide 
although we will attempt to mitigate or otherwise offset the negative effect of health care reform on our reimbursement revenue and our employee benefit plans  our actions may not ultimately be cost effective or prove successful 
governmental inquiries and shareholder litigation see note to the financial statements and part i item of this form k for a discussion of certain governmental inquiries and subsequent related litigation 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters 
however  the company may incur on going expenses  net of insurance recoveries  if any  related to responding to these inquiries and complaints 
seasonality our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida which generated approximately of that segment s revenues in normally experience higher admissions during the first quarter and lower admissions during the third quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectability of accounts receivable  insurance reserves  litigation  goodwill  intangibles and contingencies on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are appropr iate under the circumstances 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements 

table of contents receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
we report accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts and adjustments 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for uncollectible accounts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience  business and economic conditions and reimbursement trends 
medicare reimbursement on an episodic basis  is subject to change if the actual number of therapy visits differs from the number anticipated at the start of care or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for the employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we are aware of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we currently carry professional and general liability insurance coverage on a claims made basis for this exposure with no deductible 
we also carry d o coverage also on a claims made basis for potential claims against our directors and officers  including securities actions  with deductibles ranging from  to  per claim 
we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities and recoveries  if any  on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets are stated at fair value at the time of acquisition and goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 
on at least an annual basis 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of the related reporting units using a combined market approach guideline company and similar transaction method and inc ome approach discounted cash flow analysis 
these models are based on our projections of future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital as well as the weighted average cost of capital of other market participants of and a terminal growth rate of 
a basis point change in either assumption either individually or in the aggregate would not result in any impairment of our goodwill balances 
as of december   we completed our impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
future medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  admissions  volumes  our liquidity and other factors may have a significant impact on our business and could require the recognition of impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax liabilities of approximately  the net deferred tax liability is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation allowance was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at al l levels of government 
further  we have book goodwill of million which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the remaining deductible goodwill provides an annual tax deduction approximating million through we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions 
to estimate the fair value of options  we use the monte carlo option valuation model which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  projected suboptimal exercise behavior  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures  among others 
changes in any of our assumptions could materially affect stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

the million increase was primarily driven by growth in medicare admissions and episodes and a increase in revenue per episode 
revenue per episode increased approximately due to acuity with the remaining from a combination of medicare rate changes and in the geographic mix of the patients we served 
a medicare rate increase of approximately on january  and a rural rate add on of on april  effectively for the company were partially offset by the impact of the medicare reimbursement rate cut for which reduced revenue by million for episodes started in the fourth quarter which did not complete until the increase in the average number of visits per episode was caused by the increased acuity level care needs of our patients

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  cash on hand  and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility  described below  will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  cash on hand  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
in the second quarter of  the company sold  shares of common stock in a public offering for proceeds of million after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
in conjunction with the stock offering  the company retired all of its outstanding treasury stock 
in december  the company filed a shelf registration statement to provide for the issuance of up to million of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities 
on august   the company entered into a distribution agreement with jp morgan securities inc according to the distribution agreement  the company could offer and sell from time to time up to million shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through jp morgan  as distribution agent 
sales of stock were made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the nasdaq global select market at market prices 
the company issued  of our shares of common stock pursuant to this distribution agreement  which terminated june  with no additional shares issued 
revolving credit facility at december   the company had a million senior secured revolving credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  bank of america  as syndication agent and certain other lenders the facility 
the facility consists of a million credit line with a maturity date of december  and an accordion feature providing for potential future expansion of the facility to million 
borrowings other than letters of credit under the credit facility are at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  currently or libor plus a margin ranging from to  currently 
the margin for prime rate or libor borrowings is determined by the company s leverage 
borrowings under the facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the company  and all existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  as guarantors

borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
as of december   the formula permitted all million to b e used  of which no amounts were outstanding 
we had irrevocable letters of credit totaling million outstanding in connection with our self insurance programs  which resulted in a total of million being available for use at december  as of december   we were in compliance with the facility s various financial covenants 
under the most restrictive of its covenants  we were required to maintain minimum net worth of at least million at december  at such date  our net worth was approximately million 
we believe that this facility will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next year 
we will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in the company  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 

table of contents cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows were as follows for the years ended december in thousands net change in cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from current period income of million  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
days revenues in accounts receivable were and at december  and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities is primarily related to capital expenditures and additional amounts paid under earn out agreements entered into in conjunction with our historical acquisitions 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the payments of million on capital leases and notes payable which were offset by the impact of the tax benefit of stock option exercises 
the company s stock option plans permit optionees to have option shares withheld on exercises in lieu of submitting to the company the amount necessary for income tax withholdings 
such withholding of shares in lieu of taxes is shown in the cash flow as a repurchase of shares in the amount of the company receives a current tax deduction for compensation expense subject to irs limits 
such deductions related to stock option exercises in are shown in the cash flow statement as a financing cash inflow of approximately million 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from current period income of million  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenues outstanding were at december  and at december  the cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the final payment of purchase price of million from the mederi acquisition  million for a current period acquisition and capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities resulted from satisfaction of a million note payable from the mederi acquisition  net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million and net repayment of million on our credit facility 
medicaid reimbursement we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately       and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of connecticut  ohio  kentucky  florida  massachusetts  new jersey  indiana  and pennsylvania  respectively 
the state of ohio medicaid program implemented a rate reduction across the board beginning january  which will continue in connecticut s program is frozen and they are not admitting any new clients in acquisitions the company completed several acquisitions over the past three fiscal years and will continue to actively seek to acquire other quality providers of home health services like our current operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include  but are not limited to  the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  potential regulatory limitations and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
acquisition during  we acquired one visiting nurse branch which expanded our operations in ohio 
the acquisition was funded through operating cash flow and a promissory note 

table of contents acquisition during we acquired visiting nurse branch locations which expanded our operations in florida 
we funded this acquisition by issuing a million promissory note at interest and using existing cash and our senior credit facility to make cash payment of million 
acquisitions during we acquired visiting nurse branch locations 
these operations added to our market presence in florida  connecticut  ohio and kentucky and gave us market presence in new jersey and pennsylvania 
we funded these acquisitions by issuing million in almost family restricted stock  issuing million in promissory notes at interest  and using existing cash and our senior credit facility to make cash payments of million and provide a million letter of credit as collateral for patient care  inc s large deductible workers compensation exposure 
contractual obligations the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt and additional consideration on acquisitions in thousands total revolving credit facility capital lease obligations notes payable operating leases total commitments and contingencies letters of credit we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letters of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
we currently have no contingent obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage on a claims made basis for this exposure with no deductible 
pending litigation from time to time  we are subject to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business  including claims for damages for personal injuries
