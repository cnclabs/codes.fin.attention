item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with premierwest s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and  and for each of the three years in the periods ended december    and  that are included in this report 
premierwest conducts a general commercial banking business  gathering deposits and applying those funds to the origination of loans for commercial  real estate  and consumer purposes and investments 
premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits 
net interest income is affected by the difference the interest rate spread between interest rates earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and by the relative volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
premierwest s profitability is also affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses and the provision for loan loss expense 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and fees generated through premierwest s mortgage division and investment services subsidiary 
non interest expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and employee benefits  oreo and loan collection expenses  professional fees  equipment expenses  occupancy related expenses  communications  advertising and other operating expenses 
financial highlights net loss available to common shareholders for was million  a decrease from net loss available to common shareholders of million 
our diluted earnings loss per share were and for the years ended and  respectively 
the company booked loan loss provision expense of million for compared to million in net interest income declined million primarily due to interest reversed or lost on loans on non accrual status and a decline in loans outstanding 
return on average common shareholders equity was and return on average assets was for the year ended december  this compared with a return on average shareholders equity of and a return on average assets of for years ended december  dollars in thousands net income loss available to common shareholders average assets return on average assets net income loss available to common shareholders average common equity return on average equity available to common shareholders cash dividends declared net income loss payout ratio average stockholders equity average assets average equity to asset ratio 
table of contents gross loans outstanding declined million  or in and totaled million at december  compared to billion at december  this was the product of the company s strategy to reduce the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio by purposefully lowering outstanding balances in certain targeted portfolio segments 
in addition  the decline was due to limited demand for loans in the current economic downturn 
loan charge offs experienced by the bank also contributed to declines in outstanding balances 
over the past year  our allowance for loan loss decreased to million totaling of outstanding gross loans at december  the provision expense for loan losses was million for compared to million in management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate as of december   based on our assessment of loan portfolio quality and economic conditions 
total deposits were billion at december   a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease was primarily a result of management s decision to reduce the level of higher cost time deposits 
non interest bearing demand deposits totaled million and accounted for of total deposits at year end compared to million or of total deposits at december  the bank continues to aggressively pursue non interest bearing deposit relationships from consumers and businesses 
during the second quarter of  federal and state bank regulators initiated their annual regulatory examination and completed the examination during the third quarter of as a result of the examination and capital levels  in the bank became subject to a formal regulatory agreement with the fdic 
our board of directors initiated a rights offering  as discussed in note regulatory agreement  and the formal regulatory agreement required our leverage capital ratio to reach by october   a level above the published regulatory minimum for well capitalized 
our board of directors approved management s recommendations that the following steps be taken to conserve capital deferring further dividend payments on the preferred stock issued pursuant to the us treasury s capital purchase program  and deferring further interest payments on the company s trust preferred securities 
due to these and other steps taken to comply with the regulatory agreement  the bank s capital ratios as of december   are as follows actual actual minimum to be adequately capitalized minimum to be well capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio no action has been taken to date given the company s status of compliance with this requirement 
in addition  the regulatory agreement required the bank to reduce its levels of adversely classified assets as of the regulatory examination to of tier capital plus the allowance for loan and lease losses alll as of november  and of tier capital plus the alll as of april  as of october  the bank had reduced levels of adversely classified assets to tier capital plus alll to 
the company has kept regulatory authorities informed regarding its progress in complying with this requirement 
no action has been taken to date given the company s status of compliance with this requirement 
as of december  adversely classified assets to tier capital plus alll was 
the oregon department of consumer and business services  which supervises banks and bank holding companies through its division of finance and corporate securities  and the federal reserve have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings  and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by banks and bank holding companies  respectively 
we do not expect to be in a position to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or interest payments on trust preferred securities without regulatory approval or until we are well capitalized and have satisfied conditions in  and been released from  our regulatory agreements with the fdic  dcbs and frb 

table of contents the company and bank are currently subject to regulatory requirements to improve capital ratios  reduce non performing asset totals  restrict dividend payments  maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses  retain experienced management  limit deposit pricing and use of brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources 
our inability to comply with any aspect of the agreement could result in additional restrictions and penalties  impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval to effect branch transactions or other corporate activities  have an adverse impact on our ability to continue as a going concern and prolong the time we are under regulatory constraints on growing our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  impairment of intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans outstanding 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
as of december   approximately of premierwest s gross loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
accordingly  a significant decline in real estate values from current levels in oregon and california could cause management to increase the allowance for loan losses and or experience greater loan charge offs 
the company measures and recognizes as compensation expense  the grant date fair market value for all share based awards 
the company estimates the fair market value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield  the weighted average expected life of the options  and the historical volatility of its stock price 
the company establishes a deferred tax valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company continued to conclude it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized  and the valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to zero 
the determination of our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation of complex tax laws 
as such  we have written them down to the net realizable value 
prospectively  as the company continues to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on its operating results  it is possible that the company may deem some or all of its deferred income tax assets to be realizable 
in july  the company acquired two wachovia bank branches in northern california 
this acquisition included a core deposit intangible asset representing the value ascribed to the long term deposit relationships 
table of contents acquired and a negative cd premium as a result of the current all in cost of the cd portfolio being well above the cost of similar funding 
the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated weighted average useful life of years 
the negative cd premium was fully amortized at december  results of operations average balances  interest rates and yields the following tables set forth certain information relating to premierwest s consolidated average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
during the periods indicated  non accruing loans  if any  are included in the net loan category 
the yields and costs include fees  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to yield

table of contents non gaap financial mesures have inherent limitations  are not reuired to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
management believes that presentation of this non gaap measure provides useful information frequently used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company 
non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
non accrual loans of approximately million for  million for  million for are included in the average loan balances 
loan interest income includes loan fee income of  million  and million for   and  respectively 
tax exempt income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis at a effective rate for and  and effective rate for the amount of such adjustment was an addtion to recorded pre tax income of   and  for   and  respectively 
net interest income premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities the interest rate spread  as well as the relative volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  before provisions for loan losses  for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in  which was a decrease of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in the overall tax equivalent earning asset yield was in compared to in and in for the years  and  the cost of interest bearing liabilities was   and  respectively 
total interest earning assets averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the corresponding period in the decrease in earning assets was primarily the result of the decrease in gross loans offset by growth in our investment portfolio 
interest bearing liabilities averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the decrease in interest bearing liabilities was primarily the result of the reduction in higher cost time deposits 
interest expense  as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in average gross loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in  and in average investment securities comprised of average earning assets in  which was up from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities were for  for  and for during  the prime rate dropped basis points  including a basis point drop in the first four months of and a basis point drop during the last quarter of the year 
the rate has remained constant with no further reductions in or as a result  our net interest spread increased by basis points between and while declining basis points between and from a historical perspective  our balance sheet has been asset sensitive 
accordingly  a declining interest rate environment negatively impacts our net interest income absent increases in earning asset volumes or changes in the mix of earning assets or liabilities 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table provides an analysis of the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis indicating the impact of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and of changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the values in this table reflect the extent to which changes in interest income and changes in interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by the prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated to rate

the allowance is maintained at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio and has two components one of which represents estimated loss reserves based on assigned credit risk ratings for our entire loan portfolio  and the other represents specifically established reserves for individually classified loans 
premierwest applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review program and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
the allowance for loan losses correlates to management s judgment of the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  an assessment of pending legal action for collection of loans and related guarantees  and  a review of delinquent and classified loans 
although management believes the loan loss provision has been sufficient to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not require significant additional charges to operations in the future 
for the year ended december   the loan loss provision totaled million compared to million for  and million for this represents a decrease of between and and an 
table of contents increase of between and during  the bank continued to provide to the allowance for loan losses in response to credit issues experienced with a number of our borrowers 
during  there was a million increase in oreo due to the continued decline in economic conditions 
the decline in economic activity continued to be felt throughout the geographic regions in which we conduct our business 
management has continued to focus additional resources to proactively deal with credit relationships that showed indications of strain  and sought and obtained independent validation of our internal evaluations of real estate collateral dependent loans 
management has progressively enhanced the company s loan policies and procedures to adjust to the rapidly evolving economic and credit environment  conducted an ongoing and comprehensive analysis of loan portfolio quality  increased the number of credit administration personnel to oversee the consistent application and adherence to established loan policies and procedures and provided training to all lending personnel 
a more detailed review of the allowance for loan losses is presented in the table on page loan charge offs refer to the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheet and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
premierwest s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
management continues to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through detailed review and evaluation procedures and by integrating loan officers into such activities 
for the years ended december  and december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by million and million  respectively 
a more detailed review of charge offs and recoveries is presented in the table on page non interest income non interest income is primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  investment brokerage and annuity fees  other commissions and fees  and other non interest income including gains on sales of investment securities 
during  non interest income increased from million in to million  an increase of  or 
the increase from the previous year was primarily related to a  increase in gains on sales of securities  a  gain on death benefit from bank owned life insurance  other commissions and fees increased  offset by a decrease in deposit service charge income and mortgage fee income of million 
other non interest income categories increased  during  non interest income increased from million in to million  an increase of  or 
the increase from the previous year was primarily related to increases in other fee income 
in general  management prices the bank s deposit accounts at rates competitive with those offered by other commercial banks in its market area 
growth in deposits and deposit fees have been generated by offering competitive deposit products  cultivating strong customer relationships through competitively superior service and cross selling deposit products to loan customers 
non interest expense non interest expenses consist principally of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  communication expenses  professional fees  advertising  cost associated with other real estate owned and foreclosed assets  and other expenses 
during  non interest expense decreased by million or from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a one time non cash goodwill impairment expense of million and  merger related costs in the prior year 
this was offset by a million or increase in net cost of other real estate owned oreo and foreclosed assets  a million or increase in fdic and state assessments  a  or increase in third party loan costs  a  or increase in 
table of contents professional fees  a  or increase in bank insurance costs  a  or increase in losses on disposals of premises and equipment associated with the planned consolidation and closure of four branches  and a  or increase in salaries and employee benefits 
other non interest expense categories also decreased by during  non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in increased expenses were primarily driven by the one time non cash goodwill impairment expense of million 
other increases in non interest expense included million  or  in fdic and state assessments  million  or in salaries and employee benefits   or  in professional fees  and  or  in net oreo expense 
related party transactions certain officers and directors and the companies with which they are associated are customers of  and have had banking transactions with  the bank in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  the bank expects to continue to have such banking transactions in the future 
all loans  and commitments to lend  to such parties are made on the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
in the opinion of management  these transactions do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present any other unfavorable features 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and included a  tax provision in federal and state income taxes for this compares to effective tax rates of for and for the increase in the effective tax rate is the result of oregon minimum tax 
the determination of our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation of complex tax laws 
the company has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully recognize all of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we have written them down to the net realizable value 
prospectively  as the company continues to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on its operating results  it is possible that the company may deem some or all of its deferred income tax assets to be realizable 
efficiency ratio banks use the term efficiency ratio to describe the relationship of administrative and other costs associated with generating revenues to certain elements of income  a concept similar to a measurement of overhead 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income 
for the year ended december   our efficiency ratio was as compared to  and in and  respectively 
our efficiency ratio in without the goodwill impairment would have been 
generally  lower efficiency ratios reflect greater cost containment  however  the success of premierwest s community banking strategy necessitates a balance between expense control and the need to maintain high levels of customer service and effective risk management 
accordingly  premierwest staffs its branches in a manner to support its high standards for delivering exceptional customer service and maintains the necessary administrative personnel to support the desired customer service while maintaining effective risk management through internal control functions such as credit administration  internal audit and compliance

investments may be in interest bearing deposits  us government and agency obligations  state and local government obligations or government guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
premierwest generally does not invest in securities that are rated less than investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
all securities related investment activity is reported to the board of directors 
board review is required for significant changes in investment strategy 
certain senior executives have the authority to purchase and sell securities for our portfolio in accordance with premierwest s funds management policy 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase 
if management has the intent and premierwest has the ability at the time of purchase to hold a security until maturity or on a long term basis  the security is classified as held to maturity and is reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost 
securities to be held for indefinite periods and not intended to be held to maturity or on a long term basis are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reflected on the balance sheet at their estimated fair market value 
an outside broker service provides the fair market value for the available for sale securities using level inputs that are fair values for investment securities based on quoted market prices or the market values for comparable securities

table of contents during  we purchased million in additional securities 
this compares to purchases of million and million in and  respectively 
during  million in securities matured  were called  sold or were paid down 
this compares to sales  maturities and or calls of investment securities of million in  and million in during  we reported realized gains of  and  in no security sales were reported during at december  premierwest s investment portfolio had total net unrealized gains of approximately million 
this compares to net unrealized gains of approximately million at december   and  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect the impact on security values from changes in market interest rates and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses that may be recognized by the bank 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
because the decline in fair value is attributable to the changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because the bank does not intend to sell the securities in this class and it is not likely that the bank will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may include holding each security until maturity  the unrealized losses on these investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired 
securities may be pledged from time to time to secure public deposits  fhlb borrowings  repurchase agreement deposit accounts  or for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
at december   securities with a market value of million were pledged for such purposes 
as of december   premierwest also held  shares of par value federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb stock  which is a restricted equity security 
fhlb stock represents an equity interest in the fhlb  but it does not have a readily determinable market value 
the stock can be sold at its par value only  and only to the fhlb or to another member institution 
member institutions are required to maintain a minimum stock investment in the fhlb based on specific percentages of their outstanding mortgages  total assets or fhlb advances 
at december  and  the bank met its minimum required investment in fhlb 
in addition to fhlb stock  premierwest bank holds  shares of stock in the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
this stock was acquired pursuant to the acquisition of stockmans bank and reflects its required minimum stock investment in federal home loan bank of san francisco  which must be maintained for a four year period 
the company is required to hold fhlb s stock in order to receive advances and views this investment as long term

loan portfolio the most significant asset on our balance sheet in terms of risk and the effect on our earnings is our loan portfolio 
on our balance sheet  the term net loans refers to total loans outstanding  at their principal balance outstanding  net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan fees and deferred concessions 
premierwest s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that we seek  loan concentrations  our target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and limitations as to amounts 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to the bank  including the indebtedness of the borrower in a guarantor capacity 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of premierwest on a routine basis 

table of contents bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the credit administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an as needed but not less than annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the bank s loan officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board  the president and chief executive officer  or chief credit officer within their own delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to a million lending limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a million lending limit  may be approved jointly by the chief credit officer along with a credit committee member 
loans that exceed this limit are subject to the review and approval by the board s credit committee 
credit committee approval is required for credit extensions rated substandard or worse 
premierwest s unsecured legal lending limit was approximately million and our real estate secured lending limit was approximately million at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio  as of december  through december  years ended december  dollars in thousands amount percen tage amount percen tage amount percen tage amount percen tage amount percen tage commercial real estate construction real estate commercial residential consumer agriculture and other total gross loans gross loans totaled million at december   compared to billion as of december  representing a decrease 
the decline was primarily a result of loan pay downs  net of originations and recoveries  of million  transfers to oreo of million  and million in loan charge offs 
unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit were million as of december   representing a decrease of million from total unfunded loan commitments at december  for a more detailed discussion of off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the financial statements included in this report 
as indicated above  the company s loan portfolio has been concentrated in commercial real estate loans and commercial real estate loans for residential purposes during recent years  a common characteristic among community banks due to focused lending for business and consumer needs in communities within the bank s market area 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but funds are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan 
loans of this type are characterized as real estate loans because of the real estate collateral 
since  management has taken actions in an attempt to reduce higher risk commercial real estate loan volume by directing efforts away from new commercial real estate loan production 
however  the amount of commercial real estate loans remains above what management considers desirable levels  particularly in light of current conditions 
economic circumstances have produced significant reductions in real estate values  and the 
table of contents slowdown has resulted in business failures that have adversely affected commercial real estate activities 
consequently  management actively pursues additional credit support and appropriate exit strategies for commercial real estate loans that have suffered or are anticipated to encounter difficulties 
as a result of measures taken to reduce commercial real estate loan volumes  these loans decreased by million during the table below shows total loan commitments funded and unfunded by loan type and geographic region at december  dollars in thousands december  southern oregon mid central oregon northern california sacramento valley total agricultural farm c i cre residential re construction residential re consumer re consumer subtotal other total comprised of credit cards  overdrafts  leases and other adjustments such as loan premiums  etc

table of contents credit quality management is committed to a credit culture that emphasizes quality underwriting standards and provides for the effective monitoring of loan quality and aggressive resolution to problem loans 
total nonperforming assets as defined in the table below were million at december   up from million as of december  the nonperforming asset total includes million in other real estate owned as of december  as compared to million at the previous year end 
nonperforming assets amounted to of total assets outstanding at december   up from at december   and are primarily a result of the continued economic disruption that began during interest income that would have been recognized on non accrual loans if such loans had performed in accordance with their contractual terms totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  actual interest income recognized on such loans on a cash basis during was approximately  and  and  in and  respectively 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets by category december  dollars in thousands loans on nonaccrual status loans past due greater than days but not on nonaccrual status total non performing loans impaired loans in process of collection other real estate owned and foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets regulatory guidance and current accounting practice is to value all non performing assets at current appraised value less estimated costs to sell without regard to other factors or documentation 
management continues to work closely with borrowers who are motivated to resolve their financial issues through properly collateralized restructures and workouts 
management continually reviews the holding costs of certain other real estate owned in light of current market conditions 
nonperforming loans management considers a loan to be nonperforming when it is days or more past due  or sooner if the bank has determined that repayment of the loan in full is unlikely 
for commercial purpose loans  interest accrual ceases when days past due but no later than the date of acquisition by foreclosure  voluntary deed or other means and the loan is classified as nonperforming 
for consumer purpose loans  interest accrual ceases when days past due 
a loan placed on non accrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time the determination is made to place the loan on non accrual status  and it may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse interest previously accrued but uncollected 
in some instances where the loans are well secured and in the process of collection  such loans will not be placed on non accrual status 
in addition  loans that are impaired pursuant to accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  are classified as non accrual consistent with regulatory guidance 
loans placed on non accrual status typically remain so until all principal and interest payments are brought current  and the potential for future payments  in accordance with associated loan agreements  appears reasonably certain 
impaired loans are defined as loans where full recovery of contractual principal and interest is in doubt and include all non accrual and restructured commercial and real estate loans 
the dollar amount of loan impairment 
table of contents is determined using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan or an observable market price 
current accounting practice and regulatory guidance places primary emphasis on appraised value for collateral dependent loans 
loan impairment is typically recognized through a charge to the allowance for loan losses reflecting any shortfall between the principal balance owing and the net realizable value of the loan 
at december  and  nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and or on non accrual status totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the large dollar increase in nonperforming loans between and is concentrated in real estate collateralized loans  and is primarily comprised of construction and commercial real estate credits 
management has assessed the real estate collateral for impairment and charged off any impairment on real estate collateral dependent loans 
on all other real estate collateralized loans  management believes that  based on current appraisals or estimates based on the most recent available appraisals discounted for aging  adequate collateral coverage existed as of each year end

the company s principal source of non performing loans is real estate related loans 
borrowers either involved in real estate or having secured loans with real estate have been vulnerable to both the ongoing economic downturn and to declining real estate collateral values 
approximately or million of our non performing loan total of million is directly related to real estate in the form of commercial or residential real estate loans 
at december   million of our real estate related loans remain current as to contractual principal and interest payments  but were placed on non accrual status due to the absence of evidence supporting the borrowers ongoing ability to fully discharge their loan obligations

enhanced credit monitoring and early warnings are intended to provide additional time to seek viable alternatives with the borrower 
management and staff are actively involved in seeking loan restructuring and other loan modification options including obtaining additional collateral coverage for those borrowers who have experienced payment problems and wish to seek a workable arrangement with the company 
the company established an asset recovery group arg to interface both directly with borrowers and with line managers to expedite resolution of existing and potential troubled credits 
as of december   the arg had staff members 
we believe that these actions have and will continue to facilitate recovery strategies with cooperative borrowers 
in those instances where alternatives have been exhausted or determined to be impractical and default under the terms of the loans has occurred  foreclosure actions are pursued 

table of contents enhanced the quarterly watch loan review process to focus on higher dollar credits rated watch or worse not  managed by arg 
improved risk rating recertification to include relevant credit metrics in support of the risk rating provided quantitative risk rating tools and training to all lenders or loan officers to improve risk rating accuracy and consistency improved credit risk transparency and oversight through the development of a comprehensive portfolio review package including the monitoring of relevant credit metrics internal credit examinations are completed on a significant portion of our loan portfolio periodically during the year 
a continued decline in economic conditions in our market areas and nationally  as well as other factors  could adversely impact individual borrowers or our loan portfolio in general 
as a result  we can provide no assurance that additional loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or be placed on non accrual status  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future 
additional information regarding our loan portfolio is provided in note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets when the bank acquires real estate through foreclosure  voluntary deed  or similar means  it is classified as oreo until it is sold 
on december   and december  there was million and million in other real estate owned  respectively 
foreclosed properties included as oreo are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less the cost to sell  which becomes the property s new basis 
any write downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
after foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
fair value adjustments on oreo are recorded as a net loss or gain  as appropriate 
these losses represent impairments on oreo for fair value adjustments based on the fair value of the real estate 
the balance of oreo has fluctuated during the years ended december  and  as illustrated in the table below other real estate owned and foreclosed assets dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  other real estate owned  beginning of period transfers from outstanding loans improvements and other additions proceeds from sales gain on sales impairment charges total other real estate owned allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate as to the probable credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased through periodic charges to earnings through provision for loan losses and represents the aggregate amount  net of loans charged off and recoveries on previously charged off loans  that is needed to establish an appropriate reserve for credit losses 
the allowance is estimated based on a variety of factors and using a methodology as described below 
table of contents the company classifies loans into relatively homogeneous pools by loan type in accordance with regulatory guidelines for regulatory reporting purposes 
the company regularly reviews all loans within each loan category to establish risk ratings for them that include pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
pursuant to accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  the impaired portion of collateral dependent loans is charged off 
other risk related loans not considered impaired have loss factors applied to the various loan pool balances to establish loss potential for provisioning purposes 
analyses are performed to establish the loss factors based on historical experience  as well as  expected losses based on qualitative evaluations of such factors as the economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels and trends in charge offs and recoveries  among others 
the loss factors are applied to loan category pools segregated by risk classification to estimate the loss inherent in the company s loan portfolio pursuant to accounting for contingencies 
additionally  impaired loans are evaluated for loss potential on an individual basis in accordance with accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  and specific reserves are established based on thorough analysis of collateral values where loss potential exists 
when an impaired loan is collateral dependent and a deficiency exists in the fair value of real estate collateralizing the loan in comparison to the associated loan balance  the deficiency is charged off at that time 
impaired loans are reviewed no less frequently than quarterly 
generally  external appraisals are updated every six to twelve months 
we obtain appraisals from a pre approved list of independent  third party appraisal firms 
approval and addition to the list is based on experience  reputation  character  consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market 
at a minimum  it is ascertained that the appraiser is a currently licensed in the state in which the property is located  b is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised  c is actively engaged in the appraisal work  d has knowledge of the current real estate market conditions and financing trends  e is reputable  and f is not on the bank s exclusionary list of appraisers 
our appraisal review department will either conduct the review  or will outsource the review to a qualified approved third party appraiser 
upon receipt and review  an external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment 
our impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis  whether the preparer deems the appraisal to be current  and if not  allows for an internal valuation adjustments with justification 
adjustments may include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date  adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal  or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal 
an appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required 
any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis and reflected in the allowance for loan losses  as appropriate 
although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans  we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements  negotiated short sales  or the sales price of the note 
these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution 
impairment analyses are updated on a quarterly basis 
based on these processes  we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional loan loss provisions or charge offs from the date they become known 

table of contents in the event that a current appraisal to support the fair value of the real estate collateral underlying an impaired loan has not yet been received  but the company believes that the collateral value is insufficient to support the loan amount  an impairment reserve is recorded 
in these instances  the receipt of a current appraisal triggers an updated review of the collateral support for the loan and any deficiency is charged off or reserved at that time 
in those instances where a current appraisal is not available in a timely manner in relation to a financial reporting cut off date  the company discounts the most recent third party appraisal depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  property location  local price volatility  local economic conditions  and recent comparable sales 
in all cases  the costs to sell the subject property are deducted in arriving at the fair value of the collateral 
any unpaid property taxes or similar expenses are expensed at the time the property is acquired by the bank

through december   any such amendments have generally been consistent with the terms of newly booked loans reflecting current standards for amortization and interest rate and do not represent concessions to such borrowers 
in those instances where concessions have met the criteria for a troubled debt restructuring tdr  the related loans have been recorded as tdr s  placed on non accrual status and included in the impaired loan totals 
tdr s recorded by the company at december  totaled million and were comprised of loans 
premierwest s allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   and million at december   representing of gross loans at december  and of gross loans at december  the loan loss allowance represents and of nonperforming loans at december   and  respectively

table of contents the following table shows the allocation of premierwest s allowance for loan losses by category and the percent of loans in each category to gross loans at the dates indicated 
premierwest allocates its allowance for loan losses to each loan classification based on relative risk characteristics 
general  specific and qualitative allocations are made based on estimated losses that are due to current credit circumstances and other available information for each loan category 
general allocations are based on historical loss factors 
specific allocations are related to loans on non accrual status  estimated reserves based on individual credit risk ratings  loans for which management believes the borrower might be unable to comply with loan repayment terms  even though the loans are not in non accrual status  and  loans for which supporting collateral might not be adequate to recover loan amounts if foreclosure and subsequent sale of collateral become necessary 
qualitative allocations include adjustments for economic conditions  concentrations and other subjective factors  and are intended to compensate for the subjective nature of the determination of losses inherent in the overall loan portfolio 
because the total loan loss allowance is a valuation reserve applicable to the entire loan portfolio  the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category does not necessarily represent the actual losses that may occur within that loan category 
december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans type of loan commercial real estate construction real estate commercial residential consumer and other total as of december   management believes that the company s total allowance for credit losses and its reserve for off balance sheet commitments are sufficient to absorb the losses inherent in the loan portfolio  related both to funded loans and unfunded commitments 
the off balance sheet commitments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
this assessment  based on both historical levels of net charge offs and continuing detailed reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio and current business  economic and regulatory conditions  involves uncertainty and judgment 
as a result  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments cannot be determined with inherent accuracy and may change in future periods 
additionally  bank regulatory authorities may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses as a result of their periodic examinations of the company and their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient to absorb all future losses 
net earnings would be adversely affected if that were to occur 
total off balance sheet financial instruments  consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
despite diligent assessment by management  there can be no assurance regarding the actual amount of charge offs that will be incurred in the future 
a further slowing in the oregon and or california economies  further declines in real estate values or increased unemployment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income

table of contents on december   the company established two wholly owned statutory business trusts  premierwest statutory trust i and ii  which were formed to issue junior subordinated debentures and related common securities 
following the acquisition of stockmans financial group  the company became the successor in interest to stockmans financial trust i  which was established on august  common stock issued by the trusts and held as an investment by the company is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the indentures 
the trusts used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures the debentures of the company 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
the company s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the company of the obligations of the trusts 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures  or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures 
the company has the right to redeem the debentures in whole but not in part on or after specific dates  at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
in november  the company notified the investors holding its debentures that interest payments were being temporarily suspended in an effort to preserve equity capital pursuant to current regulatory guidance and policy related to dividends from the bank 
under the terms of each debenture indenture agreement  the company may defer payment of interest on the debentures for the lesser of consecutive quarters or to the maturity date of the debentures 
deferral of interest also results in interest being computed quarterly on any deferred interest payments 
at december   the company had deferred payment of interest for five consecutive quarters 
by issuing trust preferred securities the company was able to secure a long term source of borrowed funds in support of its growth needs with a debt instrument that is includable as capital for regulatory purposes in the calculation of its risk based capital ratios 
under current federal reserve bank policy  all of the outstanding debentures  subject to certain limitations  have been included in the determination of tier i capital for regulatory purposes

liquidity and capital resources  regulatory capital shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  the most significant factors contributing to the increase was a million capital raise  partially offset by million net loss  and by million for the accrued preferred stock dividend 
premierwest has adopted policies to maintain an adequately liquid position to enable it to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  premierwest s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  the use of borrowings from the fhlb and correspondent banks and net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   unused and available lines of credit totaled million of which million was available from fhlb s cash management advance program  million was available from the federal reserve discount window  and million from a correspondent bank 
scheduled loan repayments are a historically stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities available for sale 
at december   these liquid assets totaled million  or of total assets  as compared to million  or of total assets  at december  while our access to interbank credit availability remains somewhat limited due to counterparty credit concerns over the company s financial condition  the wachovia branch acquisition in july added million to our deposit base 
this action improved liquidity as evidenced by our year end liquid assets as noted above 
core deposits remain our primary source of funding 
our securities portfolio has expanded significantly since and has been used to satisfy pledging requirements for collateralizing public funds deposits 
the bank 
table of contents enhanced its contingency plans to address its liquidity needs including collateralized borrowing capacity through the federal home loan bank  other correspondent banks and the federal reserve bank of san francisco and to support its funding needs that are not covered by our core deposit base 
management has also raised additional equity see note regulatory agreement and continues to emphasize strategies for building relationship oriented core deposits over time rather than aggressively attracting higher cost transactional time deposits from within our local markets 
this strategy has enabled the bank to significantly reduce brokered deposits and borrowings  as previously noted 
an analysis of liquidity should encompass a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
cash flows provided by operating activities was million with the difference between cash provided by operating activities and a net loss of million consisting primarily of noncash items of million in the loan loss provision and million in depreciation and amortization 
these noncash items were offset by million of changes in other assets and liabilities and a million non cash write down of oreo due to impairment  and million in other categories 
cash flows provided by investing activities of million consisted primarily of million of proceeds from sales  calls  paydowns  and maturities of securities and proceeds from interest bearing certificates of deposit  million in net loan pay downs  million in proceeds from the sale of oreo  offset by million used for purchases of securities and interest bearing certificates of deposit and million used for purchases of premises and equipment 
cash flows used in financing activities of million consisted primarily of million net decrease in deposits  offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
at december   premierwest had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of credit lines available to businesses 
many of these credit lines are not expected to be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that premierwest s sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leveraged capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a financial institution is under special regulatory supervision 
at december  and  the bank was required to maintain capital ratios in excess of the published minimum requirements 
the following table reflects premierwest bank s various capital ratios at december  and  as compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes actual actual minimum to be adequately capitalized minimum to be well capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio the various capital ratios for premierwest bancorp at december  and  compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes are as follows actual actual minimum to be adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio

interest earning assets could mature or re price more rapidly than  or on a different basis from  interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits with short and medium term maturities and borrowings in a period of declining interest rates 
although having assets that mature or re price more frequently on average than liabilities will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net interest income during periods of declining interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity  or interest rate risk  relates to the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
interest earning assets with interest rates tied to the prime rate for example  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are considered interest rate sensitive 
also impacting interest rate sensitivity are loans that are subject to a rate floor 
interest bearing liabilities with interest rates that can be re priced in a discretionary manner  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are also considered interest rate sensitive 
the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities over various time horizons are commonly referred to as sensitivity gaps 
as interest rates change  the sensitivity gap will have either a favorable or adverse effect on net interest income 
a negative gap with liabilities re pricing more rapidly than assets generally should have a favorable effect when interest rates are falling  and an adverse effect when rates are rising 
a positive gap with assets re pricing more rapidly than liabilities generally should have an adverse effect when rates are falling  and a favorable effect when rates are rising 
the following table illustrates the maturities or re pricing of premierwest s assets and liabilities as of december   based upon the contractual maturity or contractual re pricing dates of loans excluding nonperforming loans and the contractual maturities of time deposits and borrowings 
prepayment assumptions have not been applied to fixed rate mortgage loans

table of contents this analysis of interest rate sensitivity has a number of limitations 
the gap analysis above is based upon assumptions concerning such matters as when assets and liabilities will re price in a changing interest rate environment 
because these assumptions are no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or re pricing within a stated period might actually mature or re price at different times and at different volumes from those estimated 
the actual prepayments and withdrawals after a change in interest rates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table 
certain assets  adjustable rate loans for example  commonly have provisions that limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and on a cumulative basis over the life of the loan 
also  the renewal or re pricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debt could diminish after an interest rate increase 
therefore  the gap table above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest movements on net interest income 
in addition to a static gap analysis of interest rate sensitivity  premierwest also attempts to monitor interest rate risk from the perspective of changes in the economic value of equity  also referred to as net portfolio value npv  and changes in net interest income 
changes to the npv and net interest income are simulated using instant and permanent rate shocks of plus and minus basis points  in increments of basis points 
these results are then compared to prior periods to determine the effect of previously implemented strategies 
if estimated changes to npv or net interest income are not within acceptable limits  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable limits 
the npv calculations are based on the net present value of discounted cash flows  using market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest for each asset and liability product type based on its characteristics 
the theoretical projected change in npv and net interest income over a month period under each of the instantaneous and permanent rate shocks have been calculated by premierwest using computer simulation 
premierwest s simulation analysis forecasts net interest income and earnings given unchanged interest rates stable rate scenario 
the model then estimates a percentage change from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over various time horizons 
the simulation model  based on december  data  estimates that if an immediate decline of basis points occurs  net interest income during the subsequent twelve months could be unfavorably affected by approximately million while a similar immediate increase in interest rates would result in a favorable change of approximately million  indicative of an asset sensitive position as of december  because of uncertainties about customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events affecting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of earnings under such conditions 
net increase decrease in net interest income in thousands net interest margin change in economic value of equity as of december   the prime rate was prime rate increase of basis points to basis points to basis points to prime rate decrease of basis points to basis points to basis points to premierwest s interest rate sensitivity gap is asset sensitive  which in conjunction with the general level of interest rates  yields abnormal changes in net interest income as further rate declines are modeled 
this occurs due to a practical floor of zero for deposit interest rates
