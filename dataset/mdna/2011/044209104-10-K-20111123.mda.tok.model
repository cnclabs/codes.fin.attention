results of operations business segment review results of ashland s business segments are presented based on its management structure and internal accounting practices 
the structure and practices are specific to ashland  therefore  the financial results of ashland s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies 
ashland allocates all costs to its business segments except for certain significant company wide restructuring activities  such as the current restructuring plans described in note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that ashland no longer operates 
ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved  more refined information becomes available and businesses change 
revisions to ashland s methodologies that are deemed insignificant are applied on a prospective basis 
as previously discussed  ashland s businesses are managed along four industry segments specialty ingredients  water technologies  performance materials and consumer markets

during  ashland elected to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland has elected to immediately recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense will be recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s historical policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is considered acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change will also improve transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  adjusting all prior periods presented 
in connection with this change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland has elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s historical policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs will include costs that are directly attributable to current employees within cost of sales 
applying this change retrospectively  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland has changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the actual business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation will more appropriately match the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment

auction rate securities at september  and  ashland held at par value million and million  respectively  in student loan auction rate securities for which there was not an active market with consistent observable inputs 
in february  the auction rate securities market became largely illiquid  as there was not enough demand to purchase all of the securities that holders desired to sell at par value during certain auctions 
since this time  the market for auction rate securities has failed to achieve equilibrium 
as of september   ashland had recorded  as a component of stockholders equity  a temporary million unrealized loss on the portfolio 
as of that date  all the student loan instruments held by ashland were aaa rated and collateralized by student loans which are substantially guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
ashland s estimate of fair value for auction rate securities as of september  was based on various internal discounted cash flow models and relevant observable market prices and quotes 
the assumptions within the models include credit quality  liquidity  estimates on the probability of each valuation model and the impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates 
during the first quarter of  ashland liquidated million par value auction rate securities for million in cash proceeds and recognized a loss of million  which was the recorded book value of this instrument 
as a result of this sale  as well as ashland s debt structure following the hercules acquisition and the ongoing impact from the global economic downturn at that time  ashland also determined during that it no longer had the intent to hold these instruments until their maturity date 
as a result  ashland recorded the remaining million unrealized loss as a permanent realized loss in the other expenses caption of the consolidated statement of income 
a full valuation allowance was established for this tax benefit at december  because for tax purposes ashland did not have capital gains to offset this capital loss 
for further information on income taxes  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following details the auction rate securities sold during  and in millions par value cash received gain or loss at september   and  auction rate securities were recorded at million  million and million  respectively  and were classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
due to the uncertainty as to when active trading will resume in the auction rate securities market  ashland continues to believe the recovery period for certain of these securities may extend beyond a twelve month period 
m capital resources debt the following summary reflects ashland s debt as of september   and september in millions short term debt long term debt including current portion total debt on august   in conjunction with the isp acquisition closing  ashland entered into a billion senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is comprised of i a billion term loan a facility  ii a billion term loan b facility and iii a billion revolving credit facility 
proceeds from borrowings under the term loan a facility and the term loan b facility were used  together with cash on hand  to finance the cash consideration paid for the isp acquisition  as well as to finance the repayment of existing indebtedness of isp in connection with the acquisition 
on march   ashland repaid its previous term loan a balance of million with proceeds from the distribution sale 
for further information see the key developments discussion within management s discussion and analysis 
the current portion of long term debt was million at september  and million at september  debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  and at september  at september  ashland s total debt had an outstanding principal balance of  million and discounts of million 
the scheduled aggregate maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and  million in based on ashland s current debt structure included in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements and the debt restructuring in conjunction with the closing of the isp transaction on august   future annual interest expense is expected to range from approximately million to million based on applicable fixed and floating interest rates  assuming interest rates remain stable 
covenant restrictions the current senior credit facility includes similar covenants to the previous senior credit facility 
the covenants contain certain usual and customary representations and warranties  and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants which include financial covenants for leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  further negative pledges  investments  payment of dividends  mergers  sale of assets and restricted payments  and other customary limitations 
as of september   ashland is in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratios permitted under the current senior credit facility are as follows from the closing date through march   as of june   as of september   from the period december  through september  and as of december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the current senior credit facility defines the consolidated leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents to consolidated ebitda for any measurement period 
in general  the current senior credit facility defines consolidated ebitda as net income plus consolidated interest charges  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  fees and expenses related to capital market transactions  restructuring and integration charges  noncash stock and equity compensation expense  and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period  less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income 
in general  consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness  banker s acceptances and bank guaranties  deferred purchase price of property or services  attributable indebtedness  and guaranties 
the permitted consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios under the current senior credit facility are from the closing date through june   as of september  and as of december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the current senior credit facility defines the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated ebitda less the aggregate amount of all cash capital expenditures to consolidated fixed charges for any measurement period 
in general consolidated fixed charges are defined as the sum of consolidated interest charges  the aggregate principal amount of all regularly scheduled principal payments and the aggregate amount of all restricted payments  which include any dividend or other distribution with respect to any capital stock or other equity interest 
m at september   ashland s calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio per the refinancing was compared to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under ashland s senior credit agreement of 
at september   ashland s calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was compared to the permitted consolidated ratio of 
any change in consolidated ebitda of million would have an approximate 
x effect on the consolidated leverage ratio and a 
x effect on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
any change in consolidated indebtedness of million would affect the consolidated leverage ratio by approximately 
x 
ashland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations 
these projections are based on various assumptions that include  but are not limited to operational results  working capital cash generation  capital expenditures  pension funding requirements and tax payment and receipts 
stockholders equity stockholders equity increased million since september  to  million at september  this increase was primarily due to net income during the year of million  million from common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans and pension and postretirement obligations of million partially offset by common shares repurchased of million  regular cash dividends of million  deferred translation losses of million and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of million 
in march  the board of directors of ashland approved a million stock repurchase program 
under the program that began on april   ashland purchased common shares through a million b automatic trading plan 
effective may   as a result of the announcement of the pending isp acquisition  ashland terminated the b automatic trading program 
purchases under the plan amounted to million  or million shares 
ashland still has the ability to make discretionary purchases of ashland common stock on the open market  pursuant to the board s original million share repurchase authorization 
in may  the board of directors of ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share  cents per share on an annual basis  to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was paid for quarterly dividends in june and september  and was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal during the prior year  a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share was paid for the first and second quarters  while cents per share was paid for the third and fourth quarters 
in conjunction with ashland s existing debt facilities  ashland is subject to various covenants that may restrict certain future payments  which could include quarterly dividend payments  although ashland does not anticipate that will occur 
capital expenditures ashland is currently forecasting approximately million of capital expenditures for fiscal funded primarily from operating cash flows 
capital expenditures  excluding distribution  were million for and averaged million during the last three years 
under the current senior credit facilities agreement entered into in august  ashland is no longer subject to a capital expenditure limit 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets contractual obligations and other commitments the following table aggregates ashland s obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement of quantities or prices are not fixed and determinable have been excluded 
m later in millions total years contractual obligations raw material and service contract purchase obligations a employee benefit obligations b operating lease obligations c debt d debt interest payments e unrecognized tax benefits f total contractual obligations other commitments letters of credit g a includes raw material and service contracts where minimal committed quantities and prices are fixed 
b includes estimated funding of ashland s qualified us and us pension plans for  as well as projected benefit payments through under ashland s unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
c includes leases for office buildings  retail outlets  transportation equipment  warehouses and storage facilities and other equipment 
for further information  see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
d capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included within this caption 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
e includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments 
variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of september  f due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities  ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties 
therefore  these amounts were principally included in the later years column 
g ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on ashland  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  other liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets tangible assets the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings are depreciated principally over to years and machinery and equipment principally over to years 
ashland reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events m on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
asset impairment charges are included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and were million in  million in and million in total depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation expense for  and included million  million and million  respectively  in accelerated depreciation related to the closure of plant facilities  included within the cost of sales caption of the statements of consolidated income 
capitalized interest for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill in accordance with us gaap  ashland reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment either annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
this annual assessment is performed as of july and consists of ashland determining each reporting unit s current fair value compared to its current carrying value 
ashland has determined that its reporting units for allocation of goodwill include the specialty ingredients  water technologies  consumer markets and performance materials segments 
within the performance materials reportable segment  because further discrete financial information is provided and management regularly reviews this information  this reportable segment is further broken down into the casting solutions and composite polymers specialty polymers and adhesives reporting units 
goodwill associated with each of these reporting units as of september  was  million for specialty ingredients  million for water technologies  million for consumer markets  and million for composites and adhesives 
due to the formation of the global joint venture with s d chemie in november  there is no goodwill associated with casting solutions as of september  when externally quoted market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units through the use of discounted cash flow models 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions 
significant assumptions ashland utilized in these models for the current year included projected business results and future industry direction  long term growth factors ranging from to and weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to 
ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be conservative estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to ashland s market capitalization  and implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of goodwill  ashland s valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment 
each reporting unit s fair value was significantly over its carrying values  except for the specialty ingredients reporting unit  whose calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by over 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the current year discounted cash flow model  a negative change in either the long term growth factor or weighted average cost of capital assumptions for this reporting unit would have resulted in a fair value modestly above its current carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of specialty ingredients within the model  ashland assumed a long term growth factor of and a weighted average cost of capital of  which are consistent with the prior year s model 
the current year s weighted average cost of capital of is considered by ashland to be conservative based on ashland s significantly lower overall weighted average borrowing rate at september  of as well as the general overall lower interest rate environment that currently exists in the credit markets 
ashland believes that the current fair value results of the specialty ingredients reporting unit are positive given that this business was recently purchased and recorded at fair value in early fiscal the current year discounted cash flow model result  which is an increase in fair value over the previous year s model  indicates the business is capitalizing on growth opportunities and cost synergies that existed at the outset of the purchase of the business 
assuming no changes in key assumptions identified  ashland currently anticipates the future fair value of the specialty ingredients reporting unit to continue to increase over time 
m ashland compared and assessed the total fair values of the reporting units to ashland s market capitalization at the annual assessment date  including the implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
while ashland s current market capitalization total approximates its current carrying value  the discounted cash flow models for each reporting unit summed together exceeded ashland s carrying value by a significant amount as of ashland s annual impairment testing date 
ashland believes its use of significant assumptions within its valuation models are reasonable estimates of likely future events 
because the fair value results for each reporting unit did not indicate a potential impairment existed  ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and subsequent to this annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
as of september   ashland recorded goodwill of approximately  million in conjunction with the purchase of isp in august specialty ingredients recorded  million and performance materials recorded million of goodwill associated with the isp transaction 
in connection with the goodwill associated with this acquisition  ashland determined that a certain amount of the goodwill should be allocated to all reporting units because each reporting unit will benefit from synergies related to the acquisition that will increase these businesses overall reported profitability 
ashland calculated the increased value each reporting unit is expected to receive from the estimated synergy savings in determining the appropriate amount of goodwill to allocate for this acquisition  which totaled the following million for water technologies and million for consumer markets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets other indefinite lived intangible assets include certain trademarks and trade names 
these assets had a carrying value of million as of september  ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
ashland tests these indefinite lived intangible assets  using a relief from royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value 
significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include  but are not limited to  such estimates as projected business results  growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to  and royalty ranging from to 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets  ashland s models did not indicate any impairment  as each indefinite lived intangible asset s fair value exceeded their carrying values 
ashland s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives  including goodwill  could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit a significant change in projected business results  a divestiture decision  negative change in ashland s weighted average cost of capital rates  growth rates or other assumptions  economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated  or another significant economic event 
for further information  see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ipr d ashland has identified approximately million of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects within the specialty ingredients business that  as of the date of the isp acquisition  had not established technological feasibility 
with the adoption of asc topic  business combinations  on october   identified ipr d acquired in a business combination is capitalized and tested for impairment quarterly 
ashland used various valuation models based on discounted probable future cash flows on a project by project basis in identifying separate projects as distinct assets  with the largest project value assessed at million 
these identified projects as of the acquisition date vary with respect to stage of completion 
as of september   the nature and timing of the remaining efforts of completion of these projects are not determinable  along with ashland s anticipated benefits from the ipr d 
the future feasibility of these assets will be evaluated on a quarterly basis by ashland or when a significant event has been deemed to have occurred

employee benefit obligations pension plans ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
in addition  ashland has non qualified unfunded pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits to those employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plans are limited by the employee retirement income security act of and the internal revenue code 
ashland funds the costs of the non qualified plans as the benefits are paid 
pension obligations for applicable employees of non us consolidated subsidiaries are provided for by depositing funds with trustees or by book reserves in accordance with local practices and regulations of the respective countries 
for further information  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
m other postretirement benefit plans ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor health care and life insurance plans for eligible employees in the us and canada who retire or are disabled 
ashland s retiree life insurance plans are noncontributory  while ashland shares the costs of providing health care coverage with its retired employees through premiums  deductibles and coinsurance provisions 
ashland funds its share of the costs of the postretirement benefit plans as the benefits are paid 
for further information  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
change in accounting policy regarding pension and other postretirement benefits during  ashland elected to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland has elected to immediately recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense will be recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s historical policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is considered acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change will also improve transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  adjusting all prior periods presented 
change in expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans as discussed in notes a and m of notes to consolidated financial statements  ashland elected during to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in connection with this change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland has elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s historical policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs will only include costs that are directly attributable to current employees 
applying this change retrospectively  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
the financial information disclosed in the following tables for each business segment reflects the retrospective application of this expense allocation change on each period 
in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland has changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the actual business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation will more appropriately match the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment 
the financial information disclosed in the following tables for each business segment reflects the retrospective application of this expense allocation change on each period 
actuarial assumptions ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the mercer pension discount yield curve spot rates 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
m ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  for and for the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be for  in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be for  in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to a gain of in and in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
ashland estimates total fiscal pension costs for us and us pension plans to be approximately million  which excludes the impact of actuarial gains or losses  and expects to contribute million to its non us pension plans and approximately million to its us pension plans in cash 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from ashland s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material affect on the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by ashland 
if actual results differ from the estimates made by ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset 
additionally  the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which includes such evidence as historical earnings  projected future earnings  tax planning strategies  and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences 
in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities other than those with an indefinite reversal period  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial operations 
ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative income or loss 
in addition  ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
m as a result of the hercules acquisition during  significant historical tax positions and structures related to hercules have been combined within ashland 
some of these previous tax positions and structures from hercules required a complete reassessment regarding certain of ashland s pre acquisition tax positions and structures 
as such  material changes in certain tax matters may occur in the future based on deviations from ashland s current estimates and assumptions in combining these tax positions and structures

asbestos litigation ashland and hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions  ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense 
the claim experience of ashland and hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ashland asbestos related litigation the claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
ashland asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent update  completed during  it was determined that the liability for ashland asbestos claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  ashland asbestos related receivables excluding the hercules asbestos claims further described below  ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
for the ashland asbestos related obligations  ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best  as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  whose insurance policy obligations have been transferred to a berkshire hathaway entity 
ashland discounts this portion of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers unless likely settlement amounts can be determined 
during fiscal  ashland entered into a new agreement with a number of london market insurance companies with respect to coverage for asbestos related insurance claims 
as a result  a million increase to the ashland asbestos receivable was recorded within the consolidated balance sheet  which had a million after tax effect on the statements of consolidated income within the discontinued operations caption 
in addition  ashland had agreed to arbitrate a dispute regarding whether there is a significant deductible in the london market companies policies in three policy periods that must be satisfied before the policies begin providing coverage for riley stoker asbestos claims 
the london market companies had contended that ashland must bear certain self insured retentions in respect of riley stoker asbestos liabilities before the london coverage attaches in these three years  and ashland disputed that such self insured retentions must be m satisfied 
the parties conducted an arbitration hearing on this dispute in june  and a decision was rendered by the arbitrator in october that essentially supported ashland s previously stated position on these claims 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million excluding the hercules receivable for asbestos claims  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers  was updated 
this model update along with potential settlement adjustments resulted in an additional million net increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
hercules asbestos related litigation hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
hercules asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent annual update of this estimate  completed during  it was determined that the liability for hercules asbestos related claims should be decreased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  during december  ashland essentially completed the final valuation assessment of the hercules asbestos claims liability existing as of the acquisition date and underlying claim files as part of transitioning to a standardized claims management approach 
this assessment resulted in a million and million reduction to the asbestos liability and receivable  respectively  which was accounted for as an adjustment to hercules opening balance sheet since the adjustment related to claims that had been incurred as of the acquisition date 
during the prior year annual update  completed during  it was determined that the liability for asbestos claims should be reduced by million 
based upon review of the assumptions underlying the prior year asbestos valuation model and the most recent claim filing and settlement trend rates for both pre and post acquisition periods at that time  ashland determined that million of the million adjustment should be recorded to goodwill  which was partially offset by million for an increase in probable insurance recoveries  totalling to a net million adjustment to goodwill 
hercules asbestos related receivables for the hercules asbestos related obligations  certain coverage in place agreements with insurance carriers exist 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve are partially offset by probable insurance recoveries 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
as of september   this estimated receivable consists exclusively of domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best 
as of september  and september   the receivables from insurers amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was updated 
this model update along with likely settlement adjustments caused a million reduction in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
asbestos litigation cost projection projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for ashland and hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models was developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables m mentioned previously 
ashland has currently estimated in various approximate year models that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately million for the ashland asbestos related litigation and approximately million for the hercules asbestos related litigation or approximately billion in the aggregate  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the isp acquisition on august   ashland assumed certain environmental and asset retirement obligation contingencies 
the total obligations assumed by ashland were million  which includes an increase of million for different remediation approaches than prior isp assumptions 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and  ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation expense is included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and on an aggregate basis amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation expense  net of insurance receivables  was million in  million in and million in environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material  as the largest reserve for any site is less than of the remediation reserve 
outlook over the last several years ashland has been focused on analyzing the businesses it operates to position the company for sustained long term growth 
several significant transactions during have transitioned ashland toward its goal of becoming a company with more predictable earnings and cash flow 
the isp acquisition strengthens ashland s specialty chemical position in higher margin and less cyclical growth markets 
in addition  the sale of distribution generated nearly billion in cash while the contribution of the casting solutions business into the global joint venture with s d chemie allows the newly combined company to better capitalize on its significant size and scale within the foundries industry 
ashland expects to focus on five primary objectives  all of which will emphasize core strategies for each of its businesses 
the first objective is to restore gross profit margins within the consumer markets and water technologies businesses to recent historical levels 
the second objective is to implement a million cost reduction program that consists of million in savings from stranded and corporate costs related to the distribution sale and the casting solutions joint venture contribution and million in synergies from the isp acquisition 
the next objective is to generate cash flow from operations in order to strengthen liquidity and position ashland to be able to retire higher interest bearing debt 
the fourth objective is to concentrate global investment and resources within high growth emerging regions 
the last objective is m to focus each business on growth in key markets  with the personal care and pharmaceutical markets having the strongest opportunities 
effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
as of september   ashland s monetary assets currently exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the united states in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change m in foreign currency rates on ashland s open foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would be a million impact on ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
ashland did not transact or have open any hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements for the year ended september  during  ashland entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with term loans a and b that were borrowed in conjunction with the isp acquisition 
as of september   the total notional value of interest rate swaps related to term loans a and b equaled billion and million  respectively 
ashland records these hedges at fair value  with the effective portion of the gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the fair value of ashland s interest rate swap assets and liabilities are calculated using standard pricing models 
these models utilize inputs derived from observable market data such as interest rate spot rates and forward rates  and are deemed to be level measurements within the fair value hierarchy 
counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements are highly rated financial institutions which ashland believes carry only a minimal risk of nonperformance
