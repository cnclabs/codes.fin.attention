store technology 
our store based information systems  which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service  are comprised of a proprietary pos system and electronic parts catalog  or epc  system 
information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system and enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated  accurate parts information 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete an automotive repair project 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our pdq system 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  pdq or master pdq with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
we also support our store operations with additional proprietary systems and customer driven labor scheduling capabilities

store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations store support center in roanoke  virginia  regional office in minneapolis  minnesota  and global sourcing office in taipei  taiwan 
our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories  oil and chemicals 
our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 
in fiscal  we purchased merchandise from approximately vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process 
the merchandising team continues to refine its category management process  including the ongoing multi phase implementation of a best in class category management system 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory turns 
our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers 
some of these brands include bosch  castrol  dayco  federal mogul moog  or moog  monroe  prestone  purolator  trico and wagner 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include chemicals  interior automotive accessories  batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft  driveworks  tough one and wearever 
supply chain 
our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses  hub s and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse  hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs 
our replenishment system utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand 
our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 
our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our stores 
benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs  ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain  iii a reduction in distribution center inventory  or safety stock  due to consistent transit times  iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs  v 
table of contents decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store in stock position 
we utilize two reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores 
we currently operate eight distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment  significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
we have ongoing supply chain initiatives in our distribution centers to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
we believe our current supply chain network  including a new distribution center projected to open in indiana in late  provides ample capacity for our projected growth in the foreseeable future 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
we currently offer approximately  skus to support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have system visibility to inventory in their respective pdq warehouses and distribution centers and can place orders to these facilities  or as an alternative  through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities

table of contents ai segment ai s business primarily serves the commercial market  with an emphasis on parts for imported cars  from its store locations located throughout the northeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states and florida 
in addition  its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under its own proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer approximately  skus with access to an additional  skus through its supply chain and local sourcing networks 
ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september at january   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states number of number of number of location stores location stores location stores connecticut massachusetts pennsylvania delaware new hampshire rhode island florida new jersey vermont maine new york virginia maryland the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed approximately  full time team members and approximately  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 

table of contents intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international and pdq for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 
competition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc 
and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service  product offerings  availability  quality  price and store location 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of automotive lead acid batteries and used automotive oil  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring automotive lead acid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead acid batteries and used oil at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
persons who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks  both known and unknown 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors 
these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons  including the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions  as mentioned above  both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  conversely  during periods of favorable economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  changing weather patterns along with increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions  as elective vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of unfavorable weather  our vendors  because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected  our reputation and our brands  because our reputation is critical to our continued success 
if we fail to maintain high standards for  or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to  product safety  quality or integrity  it could reduce demand for our products 
the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands 
if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines  in the eyes of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven  because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturer s dealer network using dealer parts  and lower vehicle mileage decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  the quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic  repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have all diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers  our revenues may decline  and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including name recognition  location  price  quality  product availability and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  store locations  store layouts  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases  lower prices  and better product warranties 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending  which would lower our 
table of contents revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines  require us to discontinue current product offerings  or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise  or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we may lose customers  our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively  or if these initiatives are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition to the aforementioned risk factors  adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending  our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share  and our ability to continue our commercial sales growth 
for that portion of our inventory manufactured outside the united states  geopolitical changes  changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  shipping related issues  natural disasters  pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings  the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new store openings we have increased our store count significantly from  stores at the end of fiscal to  stores at january  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions 
we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things the availability of potential store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources  including access to capital at cost effective interest rates  and our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates 
we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis  or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

table of contents supply chain our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and hub stores 
as we service our growing store base  we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations 
we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us  of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members  whom we may not be able to attract and retain 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members 
at february   we employed approximately  team members 
we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions  including unemployment  inflation or deflation  consumer debt levels  high fuel and energy costs  uncertain credit markets or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 
impact of credit market uncertainty significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in and resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms 
our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets 
the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings 
accordingly  any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on borrowed funds and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements 
additionally  we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations 
it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 
an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact on our suppliers our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms 
one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions 
these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short term or long term and meet our product requirements 
financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them 
we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers  and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices 
we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies  work stoppages  labor strikes or other 
table of contents interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 
impact on our customers deterioration in macro economic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth  financial resources and disposable income 
this impact could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories  maintenance or repair of their vehicles  which results in lower sales in our stores 
higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 
impact on operating expenses rising energy prices could directly impact our operating costs  including our merchandise distribution  commercial delivery  utility and product costs 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment law matters  payment of wages  asbestos exposure  real estate  and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim  this could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection  product quality standards  building and zoning requirements  as well as employment law matters 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions  while incurring substantial legal fees and costs 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours  operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december st of each year  which results in an extra week every several years fiscal contained weeks 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal which contained weeks due to our week fiscal introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  accessories  batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states 
our stores carry an extensive product line for cars  vans  sport utility vehicles and light trucks

the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts and western auto

these stores offer automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items 
in addition  we operated stores under the advance auto parts and western auto trade names  located in puerto rico and the virgin islands  or offshore

management overview during fiscal  we produced favorable financial results primarily due to strong comparable store sales growth  an increase in our gross profit rate and the repurchase of shares of our common stock resulting in earnings per diluted share  or diluted eps  of compared to in fiscal our strong earnings and favorable management of working capital during fiscal have generated significant operating cash flow that allowed us to invest in business initiatives related to our key strategies and repurchase shares of our common stock 
although we have presented our financial results in this form k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  our financial results for fiscal and fiscal include the impact of the following significant items 
our fiscal results were reduced by an eps impact of resulting from the closure of stores in connection with our store divestiture plan 
our fiscal financial results included an extra week of operations rd week as well as a non cash obsolete inventory write down of million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory  or non cash inventory adjustment 
the impact of the fiscal items was a net reduction in eps of 
fiscal highlights highlights from our fiscal include financial total sales during fiscal increased to  million as compared to fiscal  primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales 
our gross profit rate increased basis points as compared to fiscal our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense rate decreased basis points as compared to fiscal  and increased basis points when excluding the impact of store divestiture expenses in fiscal we generated operating cash flow of million during fiscal  and used available cash to repurchase million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase plans at a cost of million  or an average price of per share 
other we issued million of senior unsecured notes in april with an interest of due in subsequent to the end of fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock  which completed the availability under our million stock repurchase program 
on february  our board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program 
business update our positive financial results in fiscal are a result of the investments we have made in each of our four key strategies over the past three years  the successful execution of the initiatives supporting each of our strategies and favorable conditions in the automotive aftermarket 
our initial focus on our commercial acceleration and availability excellence strategies has resulted in consistent double digit increases in our commercial comparable store sales and strong overall gross profit improvement over this timeframe 
through our diy transformation and 
table of contents superior experience strategies  our diy sales have also improved throughout fiscal as a result of a renewed focus on customer service 
in fiscal  we narrowed our focus on fewer customer facing initiatives to ensure we consistently execute these initiatives in an effort to provide better customer service while decelerating our pace of incremental spending 
in fiscal  we have begun to focus on differentiating advance from our competition through our commitment to exceptional service which is reflected in our new promise  service is our best partsm and the convergence of our four key strategies into two strategies service leadership and superior availability 
through these two strategies  we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results 
our comparable store sales results for fiscal were comprised of favorable commercial and diy sales results 
our commercial sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal over the past three years we have completed incremental investments in additional parts professionals  delivery trucks and drivers in approximately half of our aap stores with commercial programs 
we decelerated our pace of completing these investments during the second half of fiscal and will continue to roll out these investments to the entire store chain at a more moderate rate over the next two years 
our growth in commercial is dependent on the previous investments we have made and plan on making in the future and maintaining successful relationships with our existing customers and attracting new customers 
if we succeed in these strategies  we anticipate the pace of our growth in commercial to continue to exceed the pace of diy growth 
our e commerce website is also expected to contribute to our commercial sales due to the completion of the roll out of our business to business platform during the fourth quarter of fiscal the continued growth in our commercial sales emphasizes our focus on an integrated service model and our goal of achieving a mix of commercial and diy sales 
our diy initiatives include the ongoing improvement of our customer driven staffing model  rollout of more effective training programs and a number of marketing strategies 
we are utilizing a more focused marketing approach to better target our highest potential customers and our underserved customers  which has resulted in a more effective use of our advertising spending 
our re launched e commerce website has been operational for five complete fiscal quarters and is beginning to contribute favorably to our diy sales results 
on an ongoing basis  we closely monitor independent customer satisfaction scores for both commercial and diy customers  as a measure of customer service and product availability  and have experienced improvement since the program s inception 
both our commercial and diy sales have benefitted from our added parts availability and merchandising initiatives 
we added many new brands to our parts offering in fiscal and we continued to rollout custom assortments of product in our stores in fiscal we continue to complete additions to our supply chain network to increase our ability to get the right product to our customers 
as of january   we were supporting multiple daily deliveries to a majority of our stores from our hub stores and parts delivered quickly  or pdq  facilities 
our hub stores are larger stores that stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory 
in addition to driving sales  we believe these initiatives are responsible for the continued improvement in our gross profit rate 
our gross profit rate for fiscal increased basis points compared to fiscal we experienced gross profit rate improvements in both parts and non parts categories resulting from the custom mix availability  price optimization and other merchandising capabilities and the impact of our growing global sourcing operation 
we plan to continue increasing the amount of product we source globally which is expected to provide us significant gross profit improvement and allow us to more quickly source the products our customers need 
automotive aftermarket industry the automotive aftermarket industry benefitted in from the economic environment as people kept their vehicles longer 
other favorable industry dynamics which existed throughout most of included modest increase in miles driven  increase in number and average age of vehicles  and relatively stable gas prices 
many of these favorable industry dynamics are continuing into we anticipate miles driven will continue to increase over the long term future based on historical trends and the increasing number of vehicles on the road  however  there is the potential of market pressure from the recent increase in gas prices and the rebound of new car 
table of contents sales 
we believe that our focus on differentiating through our strategies of service leadership and superior availability will allow us to continue to increase our share of the total automotive aftermarket with a higher growth potential driven by the more fragmented commercial market

components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers 
our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods approximately one year 
we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
beginning in fiscal  we began including in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores 
the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly 
fiscal comparable store sales exclude the effect of the rd week 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective merchandise and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix  ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  iii vendor programs  iv inventory shrinkage  v defective merchandise and warranty costs and v warehouse and distribution costs 
we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume requirements  when we believe it is advantageous 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our 
table of contents competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs

excluding store divestitures  this increase in sg a expenses is primarily linked to the targeted investments we are making to support each of our four key strategies which have already begun to yield benefits in our sales and gross profit results

in addition  we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at january   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  a decrease of million compared to january  the end of fiscal

dividend our board of directors has approved the payment of quarterly dividends of per share to stockholders of record since fiscal subsequent to january   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on april  to all common stockholders of record as of march  other liquidity during the last two years  we have transitioned certain of our merchandise vendors from a vendor financing program to a customer managed services arrangement  or vendor program 
under this vendor program  a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates the participating suppliers ability to finance our payment obligations with designated third party financial institutions 
participating suppliers may  at their sole discretion  make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior 
table of contents to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price 
our obligations to suppliers  including amounts due and scheduled payment dates  are not impacted by suppliers decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement 
our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing  payment terms or vendor funding  created by facilitating our suppliers ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates  while providing them with greater working capital flexibility 
any deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs  which would reduce our anticipated savings  including but not limited to  causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
analysis of cash flows a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal  and is reflected in the table and following discussion 
fiscal year in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
this net decrease in operating cash flow was driven primarily by a million decrease in cash flows from inventory  net of accounts payable  primarily due to the fiscal addition of certain vendors to our vendor program partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable ratio in fiscal  a million decrease in deferred income taxes  and a million decrease in cash flows resulting from routine fluctuations in other working capital

off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item of the sec regulations 
we include other off balance sheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments  interest payments on our credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 
contractual obligations in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility  we utilize operating leases as another source of financing 
the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations

any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
primarily includes deferred income taxes  self insurance liabilities  unrecognized income tax benefits  closed store liabilities and obligations for employee benefit plans for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond months from january  accordingly  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional considerations 
many of these incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less short term 
both cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold since these payments do not represent reimbursements for specific  incremental and identifiable costs 
total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
similarly  we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
however  these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any short term agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables  net except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets  net 
inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales 
our inventory reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise  among other things 
we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories  results from other targeted inventory counts and historical and current loss trends 
we perform cycle counts in the distribution facilities throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements 
if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels  ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions 
we also provide reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 
at the end of fiscal  we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
as a result  we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by 
table of contents million  and a related lifo and warehousing cost impact of million 
this non cash expense was presented as an increase to cost of goods sold in our fiscal consolidated statement of operations 
following this change in inventory management approach  we have been more effectively managing slow moving inventory  and we intend to continue to utilize vendor return privileges when necessary 
our total inventory reserves decreased by million in fiscal primarily due to the continued development of our physical inventory program combined with the increased emphasis on counting specific product categories to drive improved on hand accuracy 
the decrease in our inventory reserves in fiscal was primarily related to the entire utilization of our reserve for slow moving inventory established in fiscal in connection with the change in approach for slow moving inventory 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory  changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the lifecycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  warranty reserves we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties  the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer s warranty is borne by our vendors 
however  we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer 
merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks 
we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense  the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
a change in the warranty reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  self insurance reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance program started in our self insurance reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
generally  claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle 
the increase in our total self insurance reserves has remained consistent over the last two years and is reflective of our continued growth  including an increase in total stores  team members and commercial delivery vehicles 
our self insurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed  claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
specific factors include  but are not limited to  assumptions about health care costs  the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims 
effective january   we classified million of our self insurance liability as long term because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding sg a could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually during our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units 
these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units 
the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units  including but not limited to size and projected growth 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law  codes  regulations  pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  the evolution of tax law  codes  regulations and court cases  along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  new accounting pronouncements for a description of recently announced accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements  see new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form k
