item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations we do not manufacture our own silicon products 
we maintain strategic relationships with large semiconductor foundries to source our finished silicon wafers 
this strategy allows us to focus our internal resources on product and market development  and eliminates the fixed cost of owning and operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
we are also able to take advantage of the ongoing advanced process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries 
the company and fujitsu limited fujitsu have entered into agreements pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer  nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
in addition  all of our assembly operations and most of our test operations are performed by outside suppliers 
we rely on a third party vendor to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
during december  we adopted a restructuring plan under which we established an operations center and transferred a portion of our supply chain support activities from our headquarters in oregon to the new operations center in singapore in we perform certain test operations and reliability and quality assurance processes internally 
we have achieved and maintained iso quality management systems certification and iso quality systems certification  and released a full line of pld products qualified to the aec q reliability standard 
wafer fabrication we source silicon wafers from our foundry partners  fujitsu semiconductor limited in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan and globalfoundries in singapore  pursuant to agreements with each company and their respective affiliates 
we negotiate wafer volumes  prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
assembly after wafer fabrication and initial testing  we ship wafers to independent subcontractors for assembly 
during assembly  wafers are separated into individual die and encapsulated in plastic or ceramic packages 
presently  we have qualified assembly partners in indonesia  japan  malaysia  taiwan  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
we negotiate assembly prices  volumes and other terms with our assembly partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
we currently offer an extensive list of standard products in lead pb free packaging 
our lead free products meet the european parliament directive entitled restrictions on the use of hazardous substances 
a select and growing subset of our rohs compliant products are also offered with a halogen free material set 
testing we electrically test the die on each wafer prior to shipment for assembly 
following assembly  prior to customer shipment  each product undergoes final testing and quality assurance procedures 
wafer sort testing is performed by independent contractors in malaysia  japan  singapore and at our oregon facility 
final testing is performed by independent contractors in indonesia  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  south korea  and at our oregon facility 
marketing  sales and customers we sell our products directly to end customers through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
we also employ a direct sales management and field applications engineering organization to support our end customers and indirect sales resources 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and military end markets 
we have agreements with manufacturers representatives and three primary distributors  arrow electronics  inc  including nu horizon electronics corp  wholly owned subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  avnet inc  distributors of the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong 
we have also established export sales channels in over foreign countries through a network of over sales representatives and distributors 
the majority of our sales are made through distributors 
orders from our sell through distributors are initially recorded at published list prices  however  for a majority of our sales  the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
in addition  we allow returns from sell through distributors of unsold products under certain conditions 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by sell through distributors to an end customer 
at times  we protect our sell through distributors against reductions in published list prices 
we provide technical and marketing support to our end customers with engineering staff based at our headquarters  product development centers and selected field sales offices 
we maintain numerous domestic and international field sales offices in major metropolitan areas 
export sales as a percentage of our total revenue were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
export sales to china accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  to europe accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  to japan accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  and to taiwan accounted for  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
both export and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales to japan  where sales to certain customers are denominated in yen 
our largest customers are distributors and have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by arrow electronics  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiary nu horizons electronics corp 
accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by avnet  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to promaster technology corporation accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to asti holdings ltd 
accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  and during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure its distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result the majority of our revenue in fiscal was from resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  lattice terminated our distribution agreement between lattice and promaster technology corporation on july   between lattice and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between lattice and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
resale of product by sell through distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
seasonality in most years  we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products 
sales of our products are often stronger in the first half of the year and often weaker in the summer months 
in addition  december is often a weak month for sales 
however  on balance  general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry have a greater impact on our business and financial results than seasonal trends 
backlog our backlog of scheduled and released orders at january  was million  as compared to million at january  this backlog consisted of direct customer and distributor orders which includes orders to sell through distributors valued at published list prices scheduled for delivery within the next days 
the increase in backlog is primarily related to improved business conditions 
direct customer orders and sell in distributor orders may be changed  rescheduled or canceled under certain circumstances without penalty prior to shipment 
revenue associated with direct customers and sell in distributors is recognized upon shipment 
sell through distributor orders accounted for the majority of the backlog at fiscal year end and these orders are valued at list price and are subject to price adjustments 
therefore  the majority of our backlog is substantially higher than the price ultimately recognized as revenue 
revenue associated with sell through distributor shipments is not recognized until the product is resold to an end customer 
typically  a significant amount of our revenue results from orders placed and filled within the same period 
such orders are referred to as turns orders 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement made at the beginning of a period 
for these reasons  backlog as of any particular date should not be used as a predictor of revenue for any future period 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid rates of technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
our current and potential competitors include a broad range of semiconductor companies from emerging companies to large  established companies  many of which have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors in the programmable logic market include silicon and software product features  price  technical support  sales  marketing and distribution strength 
the availability of competitive intellectual property cores is also critical 
in addition to product features such as density  performance  power consumption  re programmability  and reliability  competition occurs on the basis of price and market acceptance of specific products and technology 
we intend to continue to address these competitive factors by working to continually introduce product enhancements and new products and by reducing the manufacturing cost of our products 
we compete directly with actel corporation acquired by microsemi corporation in november  altera corporation and xilinx  inc we also indirectly compete with other semiconductor companies that provide logic solutions that are not user programmable that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  analog and dsp technologies 
although to date we have not experienced direct competition from companies located outside the united states  such companies may become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
competition may also increase if other larger semiconductor companies seek to expand into our market 
any such increases in competition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
intellectual property we seek to protect our products and technologies primarily through patents  trade secrecy measures  copyrights  mask work protection  trademark registrations  licensing restrictions  confidentiality agreements and other approaches designed to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop competitive technology not covered by our intellectual property rights or that measures we take to protect our technology will be effective 
patents we hold numerous domestic  european and asian patents and have patent applications pending in the united states  europe and asia 
our current patents will expire at various times between and there can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents  or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  there can be no assurance that our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
we believe that our success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  experience  creativity and the sales and marketing abilities of our personnel 
patent and other proprietary rights infringement claims are common in our industry 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to any claim made against us  that we would be able to successfully defend against the claim or that we could obtain a license that would allow us to use the proprietary rights on terms or under conditions that would not harm our business 
licenses and agreements advanced micro devices in  as part of our acquisition of vantis corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced micro devices  inc amd  we entered into an agreement with amd pursuant to which we have cross licensed vantis patents with amd patents  having an effective filing date on or before june   related to programmable logic products 
this cross license was made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we acquired certain third party license rights held by vantis prior to the acquisition 
agere systems in  as part of our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with agere and agere systems guardian corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  these agere companies assigned or licensed to us certain fpga and field programmable system chip patents  trademarks  software and other intellectual property rights and technology  and we licensed back rights in these same assets 
these cross licenses were made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
altera in  we entered into a comprehensive  royalty free  non exclusive patent cross license agreement and a multi year patent peace agreement with altera 
fujitsu on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we advanced million in support of the development and construction of a mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
as of march   we had completed the unsecured advance payments 
during the third quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal  we entered into amendments amendments to the agreement  prior to which our million advance was to be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from fujitsu 
the amendments permitted us to also credit the advance against the purchase price of mm wafers and other services collectively  wafer credits and other services are referred to as advance credits  including engineering mask set charges 
under the terms of a letter agreement between the company and fujitsu  fujitsu agreed to repay in cash to the company million  plus interest  which was received in fiscal on the outstanding portion of the advance payment made by us to fujitsu under the terms of the agreement 
in addition  we received the remaining advance of approximately million in the form of advance credits  including engineering mask set charges  as of the end of the third quarter of the company fiscal all other terms and conditions of the agreement remained in full force and effect until repayment of the advance payment was received in full 
employees at january   we had full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
no employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
global economic conditions and uncertainty  as well as the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  could adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and expenses  collectability of accounts receivable and supplier relationships  and ability to access capital markets 
our revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the general economy or the semiconductor industry 
these downturns are often severe and prolonged and can result in significant reductions in the demand for pld and fpga products in markets in which we compete 
global economic weakness or cyclical downturns have previously resulted from periods of economic recession  reduced access to credit markets  weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies  weak end user demand  excess industry capacity  political instability  terrorist activity  military actions  or general reductions in inventory levels by customers  and may cause a decrease in revenue  gross margin  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables 
such economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during much of although business conditions improved in  that trend may not continue 
in addition  our relationships with our employees and suppliers and ability to access capital markets could be adversely affected 
in addition  customer financial difficulties have previously resulted  and could result in the future  in increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our accounts receivable 
global economic and cyclical downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
the majority of our revenue approximately of fiscal revenue is derived from customers participating in the communications equipment end market 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company participated in the china g telecommunications network build out by selling products used by two large telecommunication equipment providers one of which was supported through distribution  which accounted for a combined of our aggregate revenue 
this is primarily due to strength in the wireless segment of the communications end market 
for the fiscal year  the same two large telecommunication equipment providers accounted for a combined of revenue 
in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
in addition  telecommunication equipment providers are building networks for g networks in which we compete 
any deterioration in the communication end market  our ability to compete for new solutions in future telecommunications solutions eg g networks or reduction in capital spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our customer design in activity  and thus  future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
future revenue is inherently uncertain and could impact our ability to manage production or our ability to forecast sales 
we face uncertainties relating to the potential impact of customer design in activity because it is unknown whether any particular customer design in will ultimately result in sales of significant volume 
after a specific customer design in is obtained  many factors can impact the timing and amount of sales that are ultimately realized 
changes in the competitive position of our technology  the customer product competitiveness or product strategy  the financial position of the customer  and other factors can impact the timing and amount of sales ultimately realized from any specific customer design in 
we are presently shipping our latest generation fpga  pld and programmable mixed signal product families that are critical to our ability to grow our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
our future revenue growth is dependent on customer design in activity  market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  the quality and reliability of the product  and ease of use 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  or our current products do not maintain market acceptance  our ability to manage production levels or accurately forecast the future revenue  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products  including actel corporation acquired by microsemi corporation in november  altera corporation  and xilinx  inc we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  analog  and digital signal processing dsp technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established  multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
our revenue and gross margin  including quarter over quarter  are subject to fluctuations due to many factors which makes our future financial results less predictable 
our operating results  including quarter over quarter  have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our revenue and gross margin may fluctuate due to product mix  inventory fluctuations at our distributor end customers  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographical and market segment pricing strategies  wafer  package and assembly prices and yields  overhead absorption  as well as provisions for warranty and excess and obsolete inventory 
we have limited ability to foresee changes or the pace of changes in sales by product classification 
in the past we have also experienced periods of decline in sales of our mainstream and mature products 
if  in any period  sales of our mature and mainstream products decline and sales of new products do not increase at a rate that is sufficient to counteract this decline  then our total revenue would decline 
in addition  as mature products typically generate a higher gross margin than mainstream or new products  a faster than normal decline in sales of mature products could adversely impact our gross margins 
we also have experienced  and may experience in the future  gross margin declines in certain products  reflecting the effect of competitive pricing pressures  inventory write downs  charges associated with the cancellation of planned production lines  costs associated with our customers unplanned demand to build inventory  and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that  as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors  we are unable to pass on to our customers 
further  our ability to predict end customer demand  our customers end customer demand  and resale of our products by our sell through distributors is limited 
typically  a significant amount of our revenue comes from turns orders  which are orders placed and filled within the same period 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement at the beginning of a quarter 
accordingly  we cannot use backlog as a reliable measure of predicting revenue 
currently fujitsu semiconductor limited fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing and identifying manufacturing processes for the new programmable logic products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to introduce new fpga  pld and associated software design tool products that meet evolving customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
we are presently shipping our latest generation product families that are critical to our ability to grow our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner  or if these products or future new products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results could be adversely affected 
the company and fujitsu have entered into agreements pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on  and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
the success of certain of our next generation products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu or new foundry partners 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in establishing new foundry relationships for our next generation products  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundry partners 
because we depend upon foundry partners to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at fabrication facilities may not be achieved 
this could adversely affect our operating results 
the introduction of new silicon and software design tool products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market acceptance of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
in order to secure new or additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
export sales  primarily to the asia pacific region  account for the majority of our revenue and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
we derive the majority of our revenue from export sales 
accordingly  if we experience a decline in export sales  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our export sales are subject to numerous risks  including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental stimulus packages  controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  war  terrorism or pandemic disease  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivable collection periods  natural or man made disasters in the countries where we sell our products  interruptions in transportation  different labor regulations  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
we depend on distributors  primarily those that use the sell through distribution model  to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment 
the failure of our distributors to sell our products and otherwise perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
we rely heavily on our distribution partners to sell our products to end customers  generate a majority of our sales  complete order fulfillment and stock our products 
our distributors also help us to provide technical support and other value added services to end customers 
during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure its distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
the sell in distribution model allows the company to recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor 
in the sell through distribution model  distributors have price protection and rights of return on unsold merchandise 
consequently  revenue is recognized upon resale to an end customer 
we expect that the majority of our revenue in fiscal will be reported resale by our sell through distributors 
we depend on the timeliness and accuracy of these resale reports from our distributors  late or inaccurate resale reports could have a detrimental effect on our ability to recognize revenue and our ability to predict future sales 
in addition  our distribution channels recently have experienced consolidation due to merger and acquisition activity in that business sector 
consolidation may result in our distributors allocating fewer resources to the distribution and sale of our products  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our primary sell through distributors  arrow electronics  inc  including nu horizons electronics corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc usa  avnet  inc  and weikeng international and industrial co 
ltd made up  and of total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
at times  our sales are concentrated in a small number of distributors  which are in various international locations and of various financial strength 
financial difficulties  inability to access capital markets  or other reasons  may affect our distributors performance  which could materially harm our business and our operating results 
additionally  any reduction in sales efforts  failure to provide good customer service or any other failure to perform by our distributors as expected  could materially reduce our future sales and adversely affect our operating results 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and net income 
we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non conformance to our specifications and certain other defects 
because our products  including hardware  software and intellectual property cores  are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology  our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects  whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments 
inability to detect a defect could result in increased engineering expenses necessary to remediate the defect and also result in increased costs due to inventory impairment charges 
on occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components or made software fixes or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects 
if there are material increases in product defects  the costs to remediate such defects  net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors  if any  or to resolve warranty claims compared with our historical experience  may adversely affect our revenue  gross margins and net income 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale and our revenue or gross margin could be adversely affected 
we depend on our foundry partners to deliver high quality silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner consistent with our safety stock inventory level and production plan 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
the reliable manufacture of high performance programmable logic devices is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers and ultra pure metals  the absence of defects in production wafers  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and us 
as a result  our foundry partners may periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our foundry partners are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications with acceptable yields  or we do not have adequate safety stock in times of delivery delays  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if our assembly and test supply contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly contractor and us 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future and we do not have adequate levels of safety stock inventory on hand  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop competing technologies 
if any of these events occur  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue and defend their intellectual property rights 
we may be forced to pursue legal action to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse affect on our operating results 
we face a number of patent infringement claims and may be subject to other intellectual property disputes  which could require us to spend a significant sum to defend and could cause losses 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
for instance  we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims  including the pending patent litigation brought against us by lizy k 
john  stragent and seesaw  intellitech and intellectual ventures i llc and intellectual ventures ii llc  as described in item legal proceedings  above 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend against the claims 
any such litigation could result in a substantial diversion of our efforts and the use of substantial management and financial resources  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing  however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our wafer supply  which is sourced entirely from the asia pacific region  could be interrupted  could experience increased costs or could be reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale or increased costs 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers and most of our products  including all of our newest products  are manufactured by a sole source 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by fujitsu in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan and globalfoundries in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  increases wafer costs  or if any of our relationships with our partner suppliers are terminated  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundry partners 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be adversely affected 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity and that of fujitsu for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide or our own increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply  or periods of increased wafer prices 
during periods of economic uncertainty  our foundry partners may reduce or restructure their operations which may also affect the availability and price of wafers  and adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could adversely affect our operating results 
our supply of assembled and tested products  all from the asia pacific region  could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not assemble our finished products or perform all testing of our products 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  the effects of currency fluctuation  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war  natural disaster  disease or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could adversely affect our operating results 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers 
at present  we anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate  however  these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our assembly and test capacity commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining deliveries of finished products consistent with the capacity commitments 
we negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis 
if any of our assembly or test contractors were to reduce its capacity commitment or increase its prices  and we cannot find alternative sources  our operating results could be adversely affected 
many other factors that could disrupt our supply of finished products are beyond our control 
because worldwide capacity for assembly and testing of semiconductor products is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall demand or interruptions in supply 
the assembly of complex packages requires a consistent supply of a variety of raw materials such as substrates  lead frames and mold compound 
the worldwide manufacturing capacity for these materials is also limited and inelastic 
a significant industry wide increase in demand  or interruptions in the supply of these materials to our assembly or test contractors  could adversely effect our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our assembly or test contractors operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our supply of assembled and tested devices and could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenue levels may be affected to a significant extent by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders 
the large number of individual parts we sell and the large number of customers for our products  combined with limitations on our and our customers ability to forecast orders accurately and our relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles  may make it difficult to achieve a match of inventory on hand  production units  and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue projections 
we may experience a disruption of our business activities due to the transition to a new chief executive officer 
on october   the company board of directors announced the appointment of darin g 
billerbeck as the company president and chief executive officer  effective november  we may experience disruption in our business activities as we transition to a new chief executive officer  and our relationships with employees  customers and suppliers could be adversely affected by these disruptions 
in addition  our competitors may seek to use this transition and the related potential disruptions to gain a competitive advantage over us 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel and in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we recently implemented a new enterprise wide financial reporting system which may cause operating or reporting disruptions 
in fiscal  the company initiated the implementation of an enterprise wide financial reporting erp system to improve processes  enhance the access and timeliness of critical business information and strengthen controls throughout the company 
we converted to this new system in october many companies have experienced operating or reporting disruptions when converting to a new erp system  including limitations on a company s ability to deliver and bill for customer shipments  maintain current and complete books and records  maintain an effective internal control environment and meet external reporting deadlines 
while we have not yet experienced any significant disruptions to our business  we may encounter some unexpected aspects of the conversion that cause difficulty in the new reporting system which could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend upon a third party to provide inventory management  order fulfillment  and direct sales logistics 
we rely on a third party vendor located in singapore to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
if our third party supply chain partner were to discontinue services for us or its operations are disrupted as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event  our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely  cost effectively  or at all  would be hindered  which could adversely affect our business 
if our independent software and hardware developers and suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our contractual requirements  we may face a delay or shortage of the introduction of new products  or the support of existing products 
we rely on independent software and hardware developers for the design  development  supply and support of ip cores  design and development software  and certain elements of evaluation boards 
as a result  failure or significant delay to complete software or hardware under contract to deliver could disrupt the release of or introduction of new products  which might be detrimental to the capability of our new products to win designs 
any of these delays or inability to complete the design or development could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or operating results 
our entire long term marketable securities portfolio is invested in auction rate securities  which at the time of purchase were investment grade and acquired within the guidelines of our then current investment policy 
subsequent to purchase  these auction rate securities were the subject of multiple failed auctions  which adversely affected their liquidity 
if auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security or auction rate security issuer deteriorates  we may in the future be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through impairment charges  and any of these events could have a materially detrimental effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
at january  and january   the company held auction rate securities with a par value of million and million  respectively 
the company intends to sell its auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or reasonable offers become available 
at january   due to continued multiple failed auctions and a determination of illiquidity  the million par value of auction rate securities held by the company had an estimated fair value of million and are classified as long term marketable securities 
these auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  the amount realized could be materially different than the estimated fair value amounts at which we are carrying these securities and there could be a materially detrimental effect on our financial results 
an acquisition may harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
we have made acquisitions in the past to execute on our business strategy which create uncertainty to our future operating results and cash flows 
we may acquire products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
an acquisition will require considerable management time  may divert time away from operations  require substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt  and involve the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the success of any acquisition requires the integration of products  technologies  personnel and administrative resources  and could result in departures of key personnel  equity dilution or acquisition of unknown liabilities 
as a result  an acquisition could disrupt our operations and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks  and  as a result  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
we carry insurance customary for companies in our industry  including  but not limited to  liability  property and casualty  worker compensation and business interruption insurance 
we also insure our employees for basic medical expenses 
in addition  we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  we are self insured with respect to most other risks and exposures  and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies 
based on management assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is more cost effective to self insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures for which we self insure include  but are not limited to  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  theft  patent infringement and some employment practice matters 
should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected

therefore  the company performed an impairment test on goodwill in accordance with asc we calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the fair value of the company equity to the fair value of the company assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
fair value was based on two primary valuation methodologies the income approach  which used the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach  which used the market capitalization method 
in the allocation  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value  and  as a result  goodwill related to the acquisition of vantis corporation on june   the acquisition of integrated intellectual properties  inc on march   and the acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc on january  totaling million was written off and recorded as an impairment loss on goodwill

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview lattice semiconductor corporation lattice or the company designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices pld and field programmable gate arrays fpga each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military end markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities including restructuring charges  income taxes and deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
revenue from sales to customers is recognized upon shipment  or in the case of sales by our sell through distributors  at the time of reported resale  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer remaining acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
we sell our products directly to end customers or through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgment to reconcile sell through distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  cost of products sold  deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  and net income loss 
at the time of shipment to a sell through distributor amounts are invoiced at published list price 
the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
amounts invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable  net and inventory is transferred from inventories to deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors 
revenue and cost of products sold to sell through distributors are deferred until either the product is resold by the distributor or  in certain cases  return privileges terminate  at which time revenue and cost of products sold are reflected in net income loss 
our estimate of inventory valued at published list price and held by sell through distributors with right of return totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
distributor advances totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively and are recorded in deferred income and allowances to sell through distributors 
deferred costs of sales related to inventory held by sell through distributors totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result  the majority of our revenue in fiscal was from reported resale from our sell through distributors 
resale of product by sell through distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 
fair value of financial instruments 
we invest in various financial instruments including corporate and government bonds  notes  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
the company values these instruments at their fair value and monitors its portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge and establishes a new carrying value 
we assess other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the framework under the provisions of asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including market and economic conditions  product lifecycles and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flow for the difference between carrying value and fair value 
restructuring charges 
expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when incurred under asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  for everything but severance 
because the company has a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
for leased facilities that are vacated  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  is recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we have not recognized a valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize estimated interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the estimated settlement value of uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of substantially all share based awards consistent with the provisions of asc option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
restricted stock unit grants are part of the company equity compensation practices for employees who receive equity grants 
the restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest quarterly over a four year period beginning on the grant date 
results of operations key elements of our consolidated statements of operations were as follows dollars in thousands year ended january  january  january  revenue gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges income loss from operations revenue revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal revenue increased across all product lines  end markets  and product classifications 
revenue in fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in revenue from mature and mainstream products  partially offset by an increase in revenue from new products 
the communications end market accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
accordingly  a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on the health of this end market 
forecasting future revenue is particularly challenging as revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new products 
revenue by product line the revenue increase for fpga and pld in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily related to units sold for both product line categories driven by demand for our new products 
there was a increase for fiscal compared to fiscal in fpga units sold primarily driven by an increase in demand for our fpga new products 
pld revenue decreased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal due to a decline in units sold  primarily related to mature and mainstream products  partially offset by an increase in average selling prices 
the composition of our revenue by product line for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended january  january  january  fpga pld total revenue revenue by end market the global communications end market accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our revenue for this end market is largely dependent on five large telecommunications equipment providers  however  singularly none exceeded in fiscal and  and one of which accounted for approximately of fiscal revenue although it resulted from sell through resale by one of our distributors 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be dependent on the health of the communications end market 
the composition of our revenue by end market for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended january  january  january  communications industrial and other computing consumer total revenue revenue by product classification revenue for new products increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased unit sales 
revenue from mainstream products increased for but decreased for fiscal primarily related to an increase and decrease in unit sales  respectively

new products consist of our latest generation of products  while mainstream and mature are older or based on unique late stage customer based production needs 
generally  product categories are adjusted every two to three years  at which time prior periods are reclassified to conform to the new categorization 
in fiscal we reclassified our new  mainstream and mature product categories to better reflect our current product portfolio 
revenue by geography the composition of our revenue by geographical location of our direct and indirect customers was as follows dollars in thousands year ended january  january  january  total total total united states export revenue china europe japan taiwan other asia other americas total export revenue total revenue we assign revenue to geographies based on customer ship to address at the point where revenue is recognized 
in the case of sell in distributors and oem customers  revenue is typically recognized  and geography is assigned  when products are shipped to our distributor or customer 
in the case of sell through distributors  revenue is recognized when resale occurs and geography is assigned based on the customer location on the resale reports provided by the distributor 
revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal export revenue as a percentage of overall revenue increased in fiscal compared to and due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards outsourcing of manufacturing by north american and european customers to asia 
our largest customers are distributors and have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by arrow electronics  inc  which includes its wholly owned subsidiary  nu horizons electronics corp  accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by avnet  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to promaster technology corporation accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to asti holdings ltd 
accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  and during fiscal  we embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result the majority of our revenue in fiscal was from resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  we terminated our distribution agreement between the company and promaster technology corporation on july   between the company and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between the company and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
additionally  we converted in place distributors in the asia pacific region and europe from a sell in to a sell through model 
as a result  we estimate that revenue was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal by approximately million compared to revenue had we not embarked on this program 
revenue related to resale of our products by sell through distributors makes up   and of total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin and operating expenses our gross margin percentage was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to the significantly higher production volume in fiscal when compared to fixed overhead costs charged to cost of products sold 
additionally  due to the broad based nature of our revenue increase  revenue from our mature and mainstream products  which typically carry a higher gross margin than our new product categories  increased during fiscal we benefited from the cost reduction actions undertaken in fiscal  primarily lower freight in costs 
we also realized a benefit related to some sales of older  fully reserved products in fiscal research and development expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was related to personnel related costs  primarily accrued bonus costs recorded in connection with the cash incentive compensation plan  as well as an increase in outside service costs for engineering development 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in labor costs as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in the third and fourth quarters of and the full year effect of the restructuring plan implemented in the third quarter of  offset by an increase in mask and wafer costs 
the and restructuring plans are further described below 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm  mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in sales commission costs  marketing related costs and accrued bonus costs recorded in connection with the cash incentive compensation plan 
selling  general and administrative expense was lower in fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily related to a decrease in labor and facility costs as a result of the and restructuring plans 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc and of cerdelinx technologies  inc amortization expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization expense in fiscal and decreased as a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the agere and cerdelinx acquisitions became completely amortized during each fiscal year 
the company implemented restructuring plans during the fiscal years   and included in our consolidated statements of operations and reported as restructuring charges for fiscal  and are charges of less than million  million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from severance and related costs and costs to vacate leased properties under these restructuring plans 
on january   stephen a 
skaggs  then president and chief executive officer and the company entered into an agreement pursuant to which mr 
skaggs resigned as president and chief executive officer effective may  the company recorded and paid approximately million in severance and related costs in fiscal in addition  the terms of mr 
skaggs severance agreement allowed for a partial acceleration of vesting of previously awarded stock options

financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the use of million to extinguish convertible notes in fiscal  while no extinguishments occurred in fiscal liquidity as of january   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which was approximately million more than the balance of million at january  working capital increased to million at january   from million at january  we believe that our existing liquid resources and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we have no long term debt 
at january  and january   the company held auction rate securities with a par value of million and million  respectively 
the company intends to sell its auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or reasonable offers become available 
at january   due to continued multiple failed auctions and a determination of illiquidity  the million par value of auction rate securities held by the company had an estimated fair value of million and are classified as long term marketable securities 
these auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  the amount realized could be materially different than the estimated fair value amounts at which we are carrying these securities and there could be a materially detrimental effect on our financial results 
in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities  the company recorded an unrealized loss of million during the year ended january  on certain short term marketable securities  which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
future fluctuations in fair value related to these instruments that the company deems to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the year ended january   approximately million in unrealized gains related to the increase in fair value of auction rate securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the company were to determine in the future that any further decline in fair value is other than temporary  we would record an impairment charge  which could have a materially detrimental impact on our operating results 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  it is likely that the amount of any future realized gain or loss would be different from the unrealized gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income

in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution

new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  asu 
asu provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
additionally  asu requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price  eliminates the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
this update is effective for the company beginning january  and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
adoption is not expected to materially impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows directly when it becomes effective  as the company will not elect retrospective adoption 
however  this update may impact how we reflect multiple element arrangements entered into subsequent to january   in the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  asu 
asu clarifies which revenue allocation and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and software  in cases where the software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole 
more specifically  if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product  then this software as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption on its financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurements disclosures  which amends subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification to require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this update clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures

our investments in auction rate securities are subject to interest rate and market risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
in addition  a portion of our silicon wafer and other purchases are denominated in japanese yen and we bill certain japanese customers in yen 
we are  therefore  subject to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
these exposures are actively monitored by management  which may employ various strategies  including derivative financial instruments  to mitigate the impact on the company 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
