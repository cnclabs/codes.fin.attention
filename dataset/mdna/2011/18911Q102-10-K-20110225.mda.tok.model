item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this item is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item  the section entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
overview we are the third largest producer of coal in the us and in the prb based on coal production 
we operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry 
for  msha data for employee injuries showed our mines had the lowest employee all injury incident rate among the five largest us coal producing companies 
we operate solely in the prb  the lowest cost of the major coal producing regions in the us  and operate two of the four largest coal mines in the region and in the us our operations include three wholly owned surface coal mines  two of which  the antelope coal mine and the cordero rojo mine  are in wyoming and one of which  the spring creek coal mine  is in montana 
we also own a non operating interest in a fourth surface coal mine in montana  the decker mine 
we produce sub bituminous steam coal with low sulfur content and sell our coal primarily to domestic electric utilities 
initial public offering  related ipo structuring transactions  and secondary offering prior to our ipo and the related structuring transactions  cpe resources was a wholly owned subsidiary of rtea  which is our predecessor for financial reporting purposes 
see initial public offering  related ipo structuring transactions  and secondary offering in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item on november   cloud peak energy inc acquired from rtea of the common membership units in cpe resources in exchange for a promissory note  which was repaid on november  using the proceeds from our ipo  and became the managing member of cpe resources 
as a result of these transactions  cloud peak energy inc became a publicly owned holding company with a controlling interest in cpe resources and its subsidiaries 

table of contents on december   cloud peak energy inc priced the secondary offering of  shares of its common stock 
in connection with the secondary offering  we exchanged  shares of common stock for the common membership units of cpe resources held by rio tinto and completed the secondary offering  resulting in a divestiture of of rio tinto holdings in cpe resources 
as a result of this transaction  cpe resources is now a wholly owned subsidiary of cloud peak energy inc in addition  the elimination of rio tinto as a member results in the elimination of noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet during the period 
the statement of operations for the year ended december  will present the portion of income attributable to the noncontrolling interest through the date of the secondary offering and no income will be attributable to the noncontrolling interest in future periods 
this transaction also resulted in an increase to the undiscounted future liability under the tax receivable agreement of million and an increase to our deferred income taxes of million net of valuation allowances 
for all periods presented  our historical consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cpe resources and its subsidiaries 
for periods ending after july  the date cloud peak energy inc was incorporated  our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cloud peak energy inc  however  cloud peak energy inc did not have any business operations or material transactions prior to november  for periods prior to november   our consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of rtea  which was the parent company of cpe resources prior to our ipo structuring transactions 
as a result of our ipo structuring transactions  our consolidated financial statements reflect cloud peak energy inc as the parent company and no longer include the accounts of rtea  our former parent company 
for periods between november  the date of the ipo and december  the date of the secondary offering  rio tinto ownership interest in cpe resources is reported as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
the ipo structuring transactions and related agreements were entered into by cloud peak energy inc  cpe resources  rtea and other rio tinto affiliates while they were under common control by rio tinto 
in accordance with us gaap we did not adjust the historical financial reporting carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in connection with the ipo structuring transactions or the secondary offering 
our ipo and the related structuring transactions had significant effects on the comparability of our and consolidated financial statements with our consolidated financial statements for prior annual periods 
these effects include the following related party transactions prior to our ipo  our consolidated balance sheets included substantial amounts due from or to related parties  reflecting balances arising from services that we received from rio tinto and cash transfers pursuant to a cash management arrangement with rio tinto 
in connection with our ipo  substantially all amounts due from or to rio tinto were cancelled and converted to equity 
at december  and  amounts due from or to related parties primarily reflect certain transitional arrangements with rio tinto that were concluded in financing and cash management as a consequence of our participation in the rio tinto cash management arrangement prior to our ipo  we did not enter into any significant financing arrangements directly with third parties and we did not maintain any significant cash balances  except for cash balances held by our decker joint venture which we consolidate on a pro rata basis 
in connection with our ipo  we received cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and entered into a revolving credit facility with third party lenders 
we no longer participate in rio tinto cash management arrangement and we retained a substantial portion of the senior notes proceeds in order to fund a portion of our anticipated future operating  financing and capital expenditure requirements 
as a result of these transactions  our december  and 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets reflect significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term debt  which were not reflected in our balance sheets at prior reporting dates 
in addition  our operating results for the period following our ipo reflect interest expense related to our new debt financing arrangements 
cost structure prior to our ipo  we prepared our financial statements on a carve out basis 
accordingly  our pre ipo operating results included allocations of general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf by rio tinto affiliates 
in and  our pre ipo operating results also reflected significant expenses that were incurred in connection with rio tinto divestiture of our business 
following our ipo  our operating results are no longer affected by rio tinto expense allocations and divestiture expenses 
however  during the second half of and through  we incurred recurring and nonrecurring expenses that are necessary to operate effectively as a stand alone public company 
income taxes prior to our ipo  our taxable income was included in rio tinto america consolidated federal income tax return and we recognized income tax expense in our carve out consolidated financial statements on a stand alone  separate return basis 
as a result of our ipo and related structuring transactions  we recognize income taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on pre tax income that we expect to report in cloud peak energy inc federal income tax return  which consists primarily of our interest to the date of the secondary offering  as of december  in cpe resources pre tax income 
we did not recognize any income taxes that rio tinto america may be subject to in connection with its noncontrolling interest to the date of the secondary offering  as of december  in cpe resources  which is generally not a tax paying entity 
during the periods that we did not recognize income taxes on the noncontrolling interest share of cpe resources pre tax income ie between our ipo and the secondary offering  our effective income tax rate ie  total income tax expense as a percentage of total pre tax income was lower 
deferred taxes in connection with our ipo and structuring transactions  we eliminated rtea deferred income tax accounts from our consolidated balance sheet and we recorded deferred income taxes related to the difference between the financial reporting carrying amount and the tax basis of cloud peak energy inc investment in cpe resources 
the deferred taxes that we recorded reflect an increase in tax basis that resulted from our ipo structuring transactions and apply only to the interest in cpe resources that was acquired by cloud peak energy inc on november  the deferred taxes that we eliminated did not reflect the increase in tax basis  but applied to of the assets and liabilities of cpe resources  based on rtea prior ownership of cpe resources 
in connection with the secondary offering  we recorded additional deferred income taxes related to the difference between the financial reporting carrying amount and the tax basis of cloud peak energy inc additional investment in cpe resources 
tax receivable agreement in connection with our ipo  cloud peak energy inc entered into a tax receivable agreement with rtea and recognized a liability for the undiscounted amounts that we estimate will be paid to rtea under this agreement 
the amounts to be paid will be determined based on a calculation of future income tax savings that we actually realize as a result of the tax basis increase that resulted from our ipo structuring transactions 
periodically  we will adjust the estimated liability to reflect an updated forecast of our future taxable income and these adjustments will be reflected in our operating results 
the assumptions reflected in our estimates involve significant judgment and are subject to substantial uncertainty about future events 
changes in these estimates may have material and unpredictable effects on our future operating results 
in connection with the secondary offering  we have an additional tax basis increase  resulting in an increased tax agreement liability 

table of contents noncontrolling interest prior to our ipo and related structuring transactions  our consolidated subsidiaries  including cpe resources  were wholly owned by rtea  except for decker  which is proportionately consolidated as discussed below 
as a result of our ipo  the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the portion of our net income that is attributable to the noncontrolling interest was not equal to of consolidated equity or of our consolidated net income due to the effects of income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to cloud peak energy inc the portion of our net income that is attributable to the noncontrolling interest will reflect rio tinto ownership in cpe resources through the secondary offering 
the following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the secondary offering had occurred as of january  the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have occurred had the secondary offering been in effect for the period presented  nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be obtained in the future 
historical adjustments pro forma net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to controlling interest earnings per common share attributable to controlling interest basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic diluted pro forma adjustments primarily include the impact of the elimination of rtea noncontrolling interest and the additional income tax expense that results from the attribution of additional cpe resources income to cloud peak energy inc controlling interest in cpe resources 
additionally  the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding reflect the additional  shares offered in the secondary offering 
discontinued operations our historical consolidated financial statements include discontinued operations related to assets that were transferred or sold prior to our ipo and related structuring transactions rtea transferred its interests in the colowyo mine  a coal mine in colorado and the uranium mining venture to rio tinto america on october   and those interests were not contributed to cpe resources 
in march  cpe resources entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in the jacobs ranch mine  a coal mine in wyoming  to arch coal  inc this transaction closed on october  and the proceeds from this sale were distributed to rio tinto america 
the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the jacobs ranch mine  the colowyo mine  and the uranium mining venture are presented as discontinued operations in our historical consolidated financial statements 
consequently  the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on continuing operations as reported in our historical consolidated financial statements 
any forward looking statements exclude the discontinued operations 

table of contents decker mine we hold a non operating interest in the decker mine in montana through a joint venture agreement 
under the terms of our joint venture agreement  a third party mine operator manages the day to day operations of the decker mine 
we account for our pro rata share of assets and liabilities in our undivided interest in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method  whereby our share of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are included in the appropriate classification in our consolidated financial statements 
core business operations as of december   we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
for the year ended december   we produced million tons of coal and sold million tons of coal 
our key business drivers include the following the volume of coal produced and shipped domestically and internationally  the price for which we sell our coal  the costs of mining  including labor  repairs and maintenance  fuel  explosives  depreciation of capital equipment  depletion of coal leases and regulatory compliance  and capital expenditures to acquire property  plant and equipment 
the volume of coal that we sell and deliver in any given year is driven by the amount of global and domestic demand for electric power 
demand for electric power may be affected by many factors including weather patterns  environmental and legal challenges  political influences  international and domestic economic conditions  and other factors discussed in this item and in item a of this form k 
the price at which we sell our coal is a function of the demand relative to the supply for coal  domestically and internationally 
as a region demand increases  prices are also subject to increase  which improves the viability of transporting our coal to a more diverse customer base 
we typically enter into longer term contracts with our customers which helps mitigate the risks associated with any imbalance in supply and demand 
in addition  international demand has increased  enabling us to increase exports of coal 
we typically seek to enter into the year with expected production fully sold  however  as a result of our remaining unsold and index priced position for through  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from continued near term demand and pricing 
if  however  the us and international coal markets return to the depressed levels experienced in  our results could be adversely affected 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  we have experienced increased operating costs for mining equipment  diesel fuel and supplies  and employee wages and salaries 
changes in the cost of commodities related to our production process  such as diesel fuel  will result in changes in the cost of coal production 
we have not entered into any hedging or other arrangements to reduce the volatility in the price of commodities used for our operations  although we may do so in the future 
as is common in the prb  coal seams at our existing mines naturally deepen at a gradient of approximately to 
strip ratios have a direct correlation with our costs 
should the costs of acquiring future federal coal leases and associated surface rights increase  our depletion costs will also increase 

table of contents global climate change enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the us or some of its states or by other countries  or other actions to limit such emissions  could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
additionally  the creation and issuance of subsidies designed to encourage use of alternative energy sources could decrease the demand of coal as an energy source 
the potential financial impact on us of future laws  regulations or subsidies will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source as a result of the laws  regulations or subsidies 
that  in turn  will depend on a number of factors  including the appeal and design of the subsidies being offered  the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations  the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies 
in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors  it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
see item  business environmental and other regulatory matters climate change and item a  risk factors for additional discussion regarding how climate change and other environmental regulatory matters impact our business 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  domestic shipments from our owned and operated mines increased from million tons in to million tons in while shipments to asian export customers supplied by our spring creek mine increased from million tons to million tons resulting in total shipments increasing from million tons to million tons 
deliveries to domestic customers increased due to improved economic conditions and weather patterns leading to higher demand for coal fired electricity 
export deliveries increased due to strengthening international demand for thermal coal 
total shipments including our share of the decker mine and broker sales decreased from million tons in to million tons in this decrease is primarily due to the expiration of our significant broker sales contract in early during and the beginning of  we had one significant broker sales contract under which our subsidiary  spring creek coal llc  sold coal to a wholesale power generation company 
the contract expired following final deliveries made under the contract in the first quarter of  and the related contract rights intangible asset has been fully amortized 
this broker sales contract contributed million and million of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income before tax related to this contract was million and million for those same periods  respectively  which is net of related expenses  including amortization of an intangible asset for the related contract rights of million and million  respectively 
additionally in  we continued to focus on our cost management efforts  which resulted in reducing employee overtime  and optimizing repairs and maintenance expense 
for our owned and operated mines  the weighted average cost of diesel fuel was per gallon for the year ended december   compared to per gallon for the year ended december  diesel fuel and lubricant expenses represented and of cost of coal production at our owned and operated mines for the year ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents revenues the following table presents revenues for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent owned and operated mines other operations total revenue the increase in revenue from our owned and operated mines reflects a increase in the average price per ton of coal sold  from in to in  and a increase in shipments  from million tons in to million in the increase in average price per ton sold reflects the strong demand for prb coal due to prevailing economic and industry conditions at the time we entered into the related coal supply contracts 
other revenues consist primarily of our share of revenues from coal produced at the decker mine  broker coal sales and billings for transportation and delivery services 
our share of revenues from coal produced at the decker mine decreased reflecting a decline in shipments partially offset by higher average price per ton 
broker coal sales reduced following the expiration of our significant contract that expired in the first quarter of revenues from transportation and delivery services increased  as a result of a higher volume of coal sold on a delivered basis  including export sales with delivered pricing terms that include rail and port charges  where we arranged and paid for the freight costs and charged our customers on a cost plus basis for providing this service 
cost of product sold the following table presents cost of product sold for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent owned and operated mines other operations total cost of product sold the increase in costs for our owned and operated mines reflects a increase in tons shipped from our mines  and a increase in the cost per ton of coal produced  from in to in the increase in the cost per ton of coal produced is primarily the result of a per ton increase in royalties and production taxes  which reflects the higher average sales prices realized on our coal shipments as well as updates to estimates for non income based taxes 
excluding royalties and production taxes  the cost per ton of coal produced increased from to 
the increase in the cost per ton of coal produced is primarily the result of increases in costs related to the price of diesel fuel and lubricants  and a higher strip ratio in compared to as our mines move into deeper mining areas 
the cost of coal produced by the decker mine decreased million in  reflecting lower production volumes partially offset by higher unit production costs 
in addition  the cost of purchased 
table of contents coal decreased million  primarily as a result of decreases of million related to our significant broker sales contract that expired in and million for other broker sales of purchased coal 
the decreases in coal purchased related to our significant broker sales contract and other broker transactions are consistent with the related decreases in broker sales revenues in these decreases are partially offset by an increase in international exports in  which resulted in an increase in freight and handling costs 
operating income the following table presents operating income for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent operating income operating income was affected by the following factors in addition to those discussed above a decrease in amortization expense of million  which is attributable to the expiration of the significant broker contract in the first quarter of a decrease in selling  general  and administrative costs primarily due to costs incurred in associated with our ipo that were not incurred in  offset by the increased costs to operate as a stand alone public entity and execute the secondary offering 
total other expense the following table presents total other expense for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent total other expense change from prior period is not a relevant percentage total other expense increased due to an increase in interest expense on our million of senior notes  which were outstanding for the full year in compared to approximately one month in additionally  during the third quarter  we completed our annual update of our most recent operating plans and the resulting projected estimated future taxable income 
this resulted in an increase in the estimated liability due to rio tinto under the tax receivable agreement  resulting in a million charge to non operating income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item income tax provision the following table presents our income tax provision for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent income tax provision effective tax rate 
table of contents the effective income tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to rtea former non controlling interest for which we did not accrue taxes  offset by the effect of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets as a result of the update to the tax receivable agreement liability 
the adjustment to the effective tax rate for the post secondary offering period in to account for pretax income attributable to the controlling interest increased our effective tax rate by approximately 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item discontinued operations the following table presents discontinued operations for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent discontinued operations the change in discontinued operations was primarily attributable to the related transactions being completed in the prior year  with no impact to income attributable to noncontrolling interest the following table presents income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the years ended december  and in millions noncontrolling interest january  through november  noncontrolling interest november  through december  december  income attributable to noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest january  through december  noncontrolling interest december  through december  december  income attributable to noncontrolling interest income attributable to noncontrolling interest of million for the year ended december  represents rio tinto interest in cpe resources net income for the period from january  through december  the portion of net income that is attributable to the noncontrolling interest is not equal to of consolidated equity or of consolidated net income due to the effects of income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to cloud peak energy inc as well as the timing of the secondary offering 
specifically  the million expense related to the change in the tax agreement liability and related adjustments of million to the net value of deferred tax assets are not attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
there was no noncontrolling interest prior to our ipo on november  or after the secondary offering on december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the first half of  due to a favorable supply and demand balance for prb coal  increasing prices for our coal enabled us to enter into long term contracts at higher prices 
since mid  however  the economic downturn  particularly with respect to the us economy  coupled with the global financial and credit market disruptions  had an adverse impact on the coal industry 
as a result of our long term contracting strategy  in which we enter into forward contracts for a significant portion of our coal  we experience a lag in revenue trends compared to spot price fluctuations 

table of contents consequently  despite a decrease in tons sold from to  we experienced an increase in total revenues from sales of coal 
the weak market conditions during resulted in decreased demand for our coal and lower spot prices  and the fixed price contracts we entered into for future sales were at lower prices than the contractual prices we were able to achieve in for future sales 
these lower prices will negatively impact our future revenues for the contractual periods  which historically have been one to five years  however  we are currently experiencing a period where we  and our customers  are seeking to enter into contracts with shorter terms  which may mitigate the impact 
to further mitigate the potentially negative impact on our operating results  we have focused our cost management efforts  which resulted in reducing utilization of contractors  lowering employee overtime  and optimizing repairs and maintenance expense 
revenues the following table presents revenues for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent owned and operated mines other operations total revenue the increase in revenues from our owned an operated mines reflects a increase in the average price per ton of coal sold  from in to in  and a decrease in shipments  from tons in to million tons in the increase in average price per ton sold reflects the strong demand for prb coal due to prevailing economic and industry conditions at the time we entered into the related coal supply contracts 
the decrease in volume reflects the downturn in the overall economic conditions in the us markets near the end of and continuing into  which resulted in certain customers not taking all of their contracted purchases of coal 
our share of revenues from coal produced at the decker mine decreased  reflecting a decline in shipments partially offset by higher average price per ton 
the balance of our revenues consist primarily of broker coal sales including revenues from our significant broker sales contract that expired in of million and million for the years and  respectively  and billings for transportation and delivery services 
other broker coal sales increased by million in compared to  reflecting increases in shipments and average selling prices 
revenues from transportation and delivery services increased by million  as a result of a higher volume of coal sold on a delivered basis  including export sales with delivered pricing terms that include rail and port charges  where we arranged and paid for the freight costs and charged our customers on a cost plus basis for providing this service 
other revenues  which in included million from a decker contract settlement  decreased million in 
table of contents cost of product sold the following table presents cost of product sold for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent owned and operated mines other operations total cost of product sold the largest component of cost of product sold is the cost of coal produced at the three mines that we own and operate 
the moderate decrease reflects the decrease in tons shipped from our mines  partially offset by increase in the cost per ton of coal produced  from in to in the increase in the cost per ton of coal produced is primarily the result of an per ton increase in royalties and production taxes which reflects the higher average sales prices realized on our coal shipments 
excluding royalties and production taxes  the cost per ton of coal produced declined from to  primarily reflecting decreases in unit costs for fuel  lubricants and explosives  as a result of lower prevailing commodity prices in  partially offset by moderate increases in unit costs for labor  repairs and supplies 
the cost of coal produced by the decker mine decreased million in  reflecting lower production volumes partially offset by higher unit production costs 
cost of product sold also increased in due to the greater volume of sales on a delivered basis  where we arranged transportation  resulting in a million increase in freight and handling costs 
in addition  the cost of purchased coal increased million  including increases of million for our significant broker sales contract that expired in and million for other broker sales  consistent with the related increase in broker sales revenues in operating income the following table presents operating income for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent operating income operating income was affected by the following other factors not discussed above an increase of million in depletion of reclamation costs as a result of an increase in estimated reclamation costs for a mined out portion of the decker mine while the amount reflected a favorable adjustment upon the addition of new coal reserves at the cordero rojo mine 
in addition  depreciation increased million as a result of a higher capital base  following increased investment and capital expenditures in recent years 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depletion of million resulting from fewer tons produced in as compared to  as depreciation and depletion are calculated predominantly on a units of production basis 
a decrease in amortization attributable to the buy out of a long term contract at the decker mine in the first quarter of  which resulted in accelerated amortization of the intangible asset associated with the contract in in addition  this intangible asset was fully impaired 
table of contents later in as a result of a change in the decker mine plan during the fourth quarter  resulting in no amortization of the intangible asset being recognized during further contributing to the decrease was a reduction in amortization related to a coal supply contract that expired in total other expense the following table presents total other expense for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent total other expense total other expense declined primarily due to a decrease in interest expense  which declined due to the termination on september  of the rta facility  under which we incurred interest of million in interest expense will increase going forward as a result of the debt financing transactions entered into in connection with the ipo 
see liquidity and capital resources senior unsecured notes and senior secured revolving credit facility below 
income tax provision the following table presents our income tax provision for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent income tax provision effective tax rate income tax expense increased primarily due to higher income before taxes 
the increase in effective tax rate in was primarily due to a reduction in tax benefits received for percentage depletion deductions 
the adjustment to the effective tax rate for the post ipo period in to account for pretax income attributable to the noncontrolling interest reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item discontinued operations the following table presents income loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent discontinued operations change from prior period is not a relevant percentage the favorable change in income from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to income from the jacobs ranch mine  which was sold on october   resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
jacobs ranch mine operating income prior to disposal improved by million due to higher coal prices and the cessation of depreciation  depletion and amortization as a result of the assets 
table of contents being classified as held for sale as of march  these favorable changes were partially offset by a million increase in related income taxes 
the overall increase in income from discontinued operations also reflects the absence in of net losses incurred at the colowyo mine and the uranium mining venture after rtea transferred its interests in the property to rio tinto america in october liquidity and capital resources total cash comprises cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
as of december  and  total cash was million and million  respectively 
these amounts included cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  and restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
restricted cash collateralizes certain of our surety bond obligations at collateral levels that were established by our surety bond providers in following our ipo 
as of december   our surety bonds were generally collateralized using rio tinto balance sheet and letters of credit 
during  we posted million in restricted cash collateral as we replaced rio tinto surety bonds 
we used restricted cash to avoid the fees associated with letters of credit  which can also be used as collateral 
in the fourth quarter of we were successful in releasing million of collateral from our surety program and this balance is reflected in our cash and cash equivalents 
prior to our ipo  substantially all of our cash balances  except cash held by decker  were transferred to rio tinto in accordance with the rio tinto cash management arrangement 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  our primary sources of liquidity are cash from our operations and borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility 
cash from operations depends on a number of factors beyond our control  such as the market price for our coal  the quantity of coal required by our customers  coal fired electricity demand  regulatory changes impacting our business  reclamation costs  the market price we pay for diesel fuel  variables affecting other costs of our business and other risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of letters of credit issued 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was million 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to the terms and conditions of the facility  including our compliance with financial and non financial covenants 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our primary uses of cash for the next twelve months  which include our costs of coal production  federal coal lease installment payments for existing and new lbas  capital expenditures  interest on our debt and payments to rtea under our tax receivable agreement 
we intend to seek increases in our reserve position by acquiring federal coal and surface rights adjoining our current operations in wyoming and montana 
through the lba process  we have nominated large coal tracts adjacent to our existing operations 
if we are awarded new coal leases  which may occur as early as  our cash flows could be significantly impacted as we would be required to make the initial lease payment and annual payments thereafter 
we will continue to explore additional opportunities to increase our reserve base 

table of contents in addition  our anticipated capital expenditures  which we expect will be between million and million excluding federal coal lease payments in  include our estimates of expenditures necessary to keep our current fleets updated to maintain our mining productivity and competitive position and the addition of new equipment as necessary 
we are required to make semi annual interest payments on our senior notes  which commenced on june  we also expect to make on going payments to rtea under the tax receivable agreement  which will impact our liquidity 
if we do not have sufficient resources to satisfy our obligations  we may need to borrow money or take other actions 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants  which may prohibit us from adopting certain alternatives to obtain additional funding 
overview of cash transactions in we started with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
after making interest and private and federal coal lease payments of million and million  respectively  capital expenditures of million and generating million of adjusted ebitda  we ended the year with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
we started with million of restricted cash 
during the first half of  we contributed an additional million of cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash to collateralize our surety and performance bond obligations 
we released million of collateral in the fourth quarter of following a negotiated reduction of the collateral required 
we ended the year with million of restricted cash 
continuing operations the following table summarizes operating cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent net income from continuing operations non cash reconciling items increase in working capital net cash provided by operating activities the increase from adjustments before changes in working capital was largely due to a change in deferred taxes 
the decrease in working capital was largely driven by a reduction in related party receivables as a result of changes in our relationship with rio tinto through the ipo structuring transactions 
the following table summarizes investing cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent purchases of property  plant  and equipment other investing activities  net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations 
table of contents the decrease in cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was primarily the result of a million decrease in cash advances to affiliates as a result of the cessation of the cash management program we were under with rio tinto prior to the ipo structuring transactions and a million decrease in the cash paid for property  plant and equipment  including capitalized interest 
year to date property  plant  and equipment purchases include the acquisition of the lease by modification at the spring creek mine and the purchase of approximately million tons of privately held coal 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in restricted cash to collateralize surety bonds obligations 
the following table summarizes financing cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent cash used in financing activities from continuing operations non ipo related cash used in financing activities from continuing operations ipo only cash used in financing activities from continuing operations total change from prior period is not a relevant percentage during  we made distributions to rio tinto totaling million and principal payments for coal lease obligations of million 
distributions to rio tinto were required by the cpe resources limited liability company agreement and correspond to distributions made to cloud peak energy inc cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during was comprised of approximately billion in distributions to rio tinto offset by approximately billion in net proceeds from the senior notes offering and the ipo  all of which occurred in the following table summarizes operating cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent net income from continuing operations non cash reconciling items increase in working capital net cash provided by operating activities this increase reflects a million change in the effects of transactions with related parties 
in the year ended december   we made payments to affiliates that resulted in a million net reduction in amounts due to related parties  while in no similar payments were made and the amounts due to related parties increased by million  reflecting expenses incurred by related parties on our behalf 
the increase in operating cash flow also reflects a million increase in income from continuing operations and a million increase in deferred income taxes  partially offset by a million decrease in non cash expenses

table of contents the following table summarizes investing cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent purchases of property  plant  and equipment other investing activities  net cash used in investing actives from continuing operations the increase in cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was primarily the result of a million increase in amounts invested in the rio tinto america cash management program  an million increase in restricted cash and a million decrease in net receipts of refundable deposits related to coal reserve acquisition bids partially offset by a million decrease in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the following table summarizes financing cash flows for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  change percent cash used in financing actives from continuing operations change from prior period is not a relevant percentage the increase in cash used in financing activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to approximately billion in distributions to rio tinto  million of which represented the proceeds from the sale of the jacobs ranch mine  million of which was funded by the proceeds of our senior notes offering  and million represented the net proceeds from our ipo 
also contributing to the use of cash was a million increase in payments on long term debt  including federal coal leases  and net borrowings and repayments on the rta facility during the year ended december  that did not occur in partially offsetting these increases was in net proceeds from our senior notes offering 
discontinued operations net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations for the year ended december  compared to was due primarily to an increase in royalty and production tax payments 
net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  our cash flows reflect proceeds of million from the sale of the jacobs ranch mine  which was completed on october  
table of contents there was no cash used or provided from financing activities for discontinued operations during due to the absence of colowyo financing activities as a result of the october disposal of colowyo 
senior unsecured notes we refer to the million senior notes due december  the notes and the million senior notes due december  the notes collectively as the senior notes 
the notes and notes bear interest at fixed annual rates of and  respectively 
there is no mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments for the senior notes and interest payments are due semi annually on june and december  beginning on june  subject to certain limitations  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter 
similarly  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter 
in connection with our ipo structuring transactions  we distributed million of the net proceeds to rtea during the fourth quarter of the remaining net proceeds from the senior notes offering were designated for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our debt under our credit facility 
see senior secured revolving credit facility below 
substantially all of our consolidated subsidiaries  excluding decker coal company  are considered to be restricted subsidiaries and guarantee the senior notes 
the indenture governing the senior notes  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase equity or repay subordinated indebtedness  make investments or certain other restricted payments  create liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends  distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and the assets of their restricted subsidiaries on a combined basis 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change in control as defined in the indenture  holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
senior secured revolving credit facility concurrent with the offering of the senior notes  we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility  or credit facility  with a syndicate of lenders  the full amount of which is available for use in connection with loans or the issuance of letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit facility are supported by a guarantee by our domestic restricted subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures on december  as of december   there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility and million was committed in connection with the issuance of letters of credit 
the letters of credit are used as collateral to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining 
see off balance sheet arrangements below 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at the greater of the libor or  plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating of between and depending on our credit rating at december  
we are required to pay the lenders a commitment fee of per year on the unused amount of the credit facility 
letters of credit issued under the credit facility  unless drawn upon  will bear interest at the applicable margin for libor loans from the date at which they are issued 
in addition  in connection with the issuance of a letter of credit we will be required to 
table of contents pay the issuing bank a fronting fee of plus additional customary administrative fees and expenses 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all of the assets of certain of our subsidiaries  subject to certain permitted liens and to customary exceptions for similar coal financings 
we are subject to financial maintenance covenants based on ebitda which is defined in the credit agreement and is not the same as ebitda or adjusted ebitda presented elsewhere in this report requiring us to maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and providing for a limitation on our total and first lien senior secured debt leverage ratios 
specifically  the credit agreement requires us to maintain a ratio of ebitda to consolidated net cash interest expense equal to or greater than to  a ratio of funded debt to ebitda equal to or less than to  and a ratio of first lien senior secured debt to ebitda equal to or less than to as long as the credit facility is in effect 
our credit facility also requires us to comply with non financial covenants that restrict certain corporate activities and certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary events of default with customary grace periods and thresholds 
these covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and pay dividends  among other restrictive covenants 
our ability to access the available funds under our credit facility may be impaired in the event that we do not comply with the covenant requirements or if we default on our obligations under the agreement 
in addition  under the terms of our credit facility  a change in control of cloud peak energy inc or cpe resources will result in an automatic event of default and  unless waived by the required lenders  will result in all obligations under the agreement becoming immediately due and payable 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facility 
federal coal leases our federal coal lease obligations consist of amounts payable to the blm under leases  each of which require five equal annual payments 
the remaining aggregate annual payments under our existing federal coal leases total million  with million due in  million due in and million due in we recognize imputed interest on federal coal leases based on an estimate of the credit adjusted  risk free rate reflecting our estimated credit rating at the inception of the lease 
the outstanding principal balance of our federal coal lease obligations was million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are party to a number of arrangements that secure our performance under certain legal obligations 
these arrangements include letters of credit and surety bonds 
we use these arrangements primarily to comply with federal and state laws that require us to secure the performance of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure or reclamation costs  coal lease obligations  state workers compensation and federal black lung liabilities 
these arrangements are typically renewable annually 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
while we were a subsidiary of rio tinto  rio tinto maintained our surety bonds and facilitated the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf 
pursuant to our ipo structuring agreements  we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to obtain new surety bonds  letters of credit or other credit arrangements and to obtain the full release of rio tinto with respect to any existing arrangements 
as of december   with the exception of our obligations with respect to decker  rio tinto remained the guarantor and we maintained million in restricted cash as collateral for the benefit of rio tinto 
we completed the replacement of surety bonds and letters of credit provided by rio 
table of contents tinto on our behalf during these surety bonds are collateralized by a restricted cash balance of million 
as of december   we used surety bonds and letters of credit to secure outstanding obligations as follows in millions surety bonds letters of credit total reclamation obligations lease obligations other obligations total off balance sheet obligations collateralized by restricted cash reclamation obligations include amounts to secure performance related to our outstanding obligations to reclaim areas disturbed by our mining activities and are a requirement under our state mining permits 
includes million representing our share of surety bonds securing decker reclamation obligations and million in letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility to secure our share of additional decker reclamation obligations 
lease obligations include amounts generally required as a condition to state or federal coal leases  the amounts vary and are mandated by the governing agency 
other obligations include amounts required for exploration permits  water well construction and monitoring and other miscellaneous items as mandated by the applicable governing agencies 
we are required to collateralize our surety bonds with cash or letters of credit 
we can substitute collateral  at our discretion 
our outstanding surety bonds in respect of our reclamation and lease obligations were million at december  including our obligations with respect to the decker mine and are required by law 
state statutes regulate and determine the calculation of the amounts of the bonds that we are required to hold 
we do not believe that these state mandated estimates are a true reflection of what our actual reclamation costs will be 
reclamation bond amounts represent an estimate of the near term reclamation liability that assumes reclamation activities will be performed by a third party during the next one to five years 
because this evaluation is near term  it is recalculated on a frequent basis  often annually 
the basis for calculating bond requirements is substantially different than the requirements that apply to the determination of our asset retirement obligation  or aro  liability on our consolidated balance sheet  which is determined in accordance with us gaap 
the state calculates our specific bond requirements considering assumed costs that the state would incur if they were required to complete the reclamation on our behalf 
additionally  where a multi year bond  such as a three to five year bond  is put into place  the state regulatory authority requires that the reclamation liability must be calculated for the highest cost scenario over that period 

table of contents the carrying amount of our reclamation obligations  as determined in accordance with us gaap  which are reported in our consolidated financial statements  as aro liabilities  was million at december   million of which is payable in we estimate our aro liabilities based on disturbed acreage to date and third party cost estimates 
the estimated aro liabilities are also based on engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to the reclamation requirements 
we also assume that reclamation will be completed after the end of the mine life based on our current reclamation area profiles  which may be a different land disturbance assumption than the state requires  as we perform reclamation concurrently with our mining activities 
we have estimated that we will perform concurrent reclamation of approximately million during concurrent reclamation is performed on an annual basis as a part of our normal mining operations 
finally  the carrying amount of our aro liabilities reflects discounting of estimated reclamation costs using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
for a discussion of the risks relating to our reclamation obligations  see item a risk factors risks related to our business and industry if the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate  our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated 
because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds or letters of credit in place before mining can commence  or continue  our failure to maintain surety bonds  letters of credit or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms  the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety and restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit facility then in place

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this table does not include our estimated aros 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates asset retirement obligations below  the current and noncurrent carrying amount of our aros involves a number of estimates  including the amount and timing of the payments to satisfy these obligations 
the timing of payments is based on numerous factors  including projected mine closing dates 
based on our assumptions  the carrying amount of our aros excluding concurrent reclamation as determined in accordance with us gaap is million as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this table does not include our contractual obligations related to an agreement we entered into in april to purchase land adjacent to our antelope mine  whereby the seller may require us to pay a purchase price of up to million  which will close between april and april this table does not include payments that we expect to make under the tax receivable agreement 
we have recognized a million liability for our estimated payments to rtea under the tax receivable agreement  of which million and million is classified as current and noncurrent  respectively  as of december  the estimated liability is based on forecasts of future taxable income over the anticipated life of our mining operations and reclamation activities  assuming no additional coal reserves are acquired 
the assumptions used in our forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty about our future business operations and the actual payments that we are required to make under the tax receivable agreement could differ materially from our estimates 
based on our estimates as of december   we expect to make payments of million in and payments averaging approximately million during to see item a risk factors risks related to our corporate structure we are required to pay rtea for most of the tax benefits we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we received in connection with our ipo  related ipo structuring transactions and the secondary offering 
in certain cases  payments to rtea may be accelerated or exceed our actual cash tax savings 
these provisions may deter a change in control of our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our judgments  estimates and assumptions on historical information and other known factors that we deem relevant 
estimates are inherently subjective  as significant management judgment is required regarding the assumptions utilized to calculate accounting estimates in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this section describes those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from coal sales are recognized when a customer takes delivery of our coal  which usually occurs at the time of shipment from our mine 
some coal supply agreements provide for price adjustments based on variations in quality characteristics of the coal shipped 
in certain cases  a customer analysis of the coal quality is binding and the results of the analysis are received on a delayed basis 
in these cases  we estimate the amount of the quality adjustment and adjust the estimate 
table of contents to actual when the information is provided by the customer 
historically such adjustments have not been material 
asset retirement obligations our aros arise from the smcra and similar state statutes 
these regulations require that we  upon closure of a mine  restore the mine property in accordance with an approved reclamation plan issued in conjunction with our mining permit 
our aros are recorded initially at fair value  or the amount at which we estimate we could transfer our future reclamation obligations to informed and willing third parties 
we use estimates of future third party costs to arrive at the aros because the fair value of such costs generally reflects a profit component 
it has been our practice  and we anticipate it will continue to be our practice  to perform a substantial portion of the reclamation work using internal resources 
hence  the estimated costs used in determining the carrying amount of our aros may exceed the amounts that are eventually paid for reclamation costs if the reclamation work is performed using internal resources 
to determine our aros  we calculate on a mine by mine basis the present value of estimated future reclamation cash flows based upon each mine permit requirements  estimates of the current disturbed acreage subject to reclamation  which is based upon approved mining plans  estimates of future reclamation costs and assumptions regarding the mine productivity  which are based on engineering estimates that include estimates of volumes of earth and topsoil to be moved  the use of particular pieces of large mining equipment to move the earth and the operating costs for those pieces of equipment 
these cash flow estimates are discounted at an adjusted  risk free interest rate based on us treasury bonds with a maturity similar to the expected life of the mine 
the amount initially recorded as an aro for a mine may change as a result of mining permit changes granted by mining regulators  changes in the timing of mining activities and the mine productivity from original estimates and changes in the estimated costs or the timing of reclamation activities 
we periodically update estimates of cash expenditures to meet each mine reclamation requirements and we adjust the aro in accordance with us gaap  which generally requires a measurement of the present value of any increase in estimated reclamation costs using an adjusted  risk free interest rate based on us treasury bonds with a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the mine 
adjustments to the aro for decreases in the estimated amount of reclamation costs are measured using an adjusted  risk free interest rate as of the date of the initial recognition of the aro 
annually  we analyze aros on a mine by mine basis and  if necessary  adjust the balance to take into account any changes in estimates 
federal coal leases upon the award date of federal coal leases  pursuant to which payments are required to be paid in equal annual installments  we recognize an asset for the related mineral rights in property  plant and equipment and a corresponding liability for our future payment obligations in long term debt 
the amount recognized as an asset is the sum of the initial installment due at the effective date of the lease and the amount recognized in long term debt  which reflects the present value of the remaining installments 
we determine the present value of the remaining installments using an estimate of the credit adjusted  risk free rate that reflects our credit rating 
interest is recognized over the term of the lease based on the imputed interest rate that was used to determine the initial long term debt amount on the effective date 
such interest may be capitalized while activities are in progress to prepare the acquired coal reserves for mining 
the mineral rights asset recorded at the effective date is eventually recognized in depreciation and depletion expense using the units of production method over the period the related coal reserves are mined 

table of contents income taxes and tax agreement liability our consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  were million  net of a million valuation allowance 
if future taxable income differs from our estimates or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  adjustments to the valuation allowance may be needed 
periodically  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance to reflect our updated estimate of the tax benefits that are more likely than not to be realized 
our evaluation is based on our consideration of cpe resources historical operations  the effects of the structuring and financing transactions completed in connection with our ipo and secondary offering  updated forecasts of taxable income over the remaining lives of our mines  the availability of tax planning strategies and other factors 
we have recognized a tax agreement liability reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay to rtea under this agreement 
periodically  we adjust the liability based on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay  using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
these periodic adjustments to the tax agreement liability are reflected in our consolidated pre tax income  and may also result in corresponding adjustments to our income tax expense and deferred income tax accounts 
acquisitions of additional coal leases are likely to increase our tax agreement liability and related deferred tax asset in the future 
although our periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and tax agreement liability are based on consistent assumptions  the calculations required to determine these estimates differ in certain respects and the related adjustments will not have offsetting or proportionate effects on our earnings 
in addition  our estimates reflect assumptions about future events that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  our periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the tax agreement liability may have material and unpredictable effects on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business has historically experienced only limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasons 
demand for coal fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather  as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating 
conversely  mild weather can result in softer demand for our coal 
adverse weather conditions  such as blizzards or floods  can impact our ability to mine and ship our coal  and our customers ability to take delivery of coal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices 
we believe our principal market risks are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risks market risk includes the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio 
due to the lack of quoted market prices and the long term nature of our forward sales position  we have not quantified the market risk related to our coal supply agreements 
historically  we have principally managed the commodity price risk for our coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements of varying terms and durations  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we also face price risk involving other commodities used in our production process such as diesel fuel 
based on our projections of our usage of diesel fuel for the next months  and assuming that the average cost of diesel fuel increases by  we would incur additional fuel costs of approximately 
table of contents million over the next twelve months 
historically  we have not hedged commodities such as diesel fuel 
we may enter into hedging arrangements in the future 
interest rate risk our credit facility is subject to an adjustable interest rate 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior secured revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of december  if we borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  we may be subject to increased sensitivity to interest rate movements 
any future debt arrangements that we enter into may also have adjustable interest rates that may increase our sensitivity to interest rate movements
