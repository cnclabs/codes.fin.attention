item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying financial statements and notes related thereto that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
it includes forward looking statements that may reflect our estimates  beliefs  plans and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore oil and natural gas reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on our waterflood oil recovery programs and horizontal drilling in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california and on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  approximately of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contributed drilling locations  paid tangible drilling costs and provided turnkey drilling services  natural gas marketing services and well services to the drilling programs and the company retained an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
after our initial public offering in  the company has transitioned from being the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs to becoming a more traditional exploration and production company 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its accounting method for oil and gas properties from the successful efforts method to the full cost method 
as a result of this accounting change  turnkey profit  well services profit and marketing profit are not recognized on the statement of operations but are recorded as reductions to the full cost pool 
all historical information included in this form k has been retroactively restated to give effect to the change in accounting method 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during to million at december  this resulted from cash provided by operating activities of million offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by oil and gas operations 
cash used in investing activities was primarily spent on oil and gas properties and equipment 
cash used in financing activities primarily represented the company reducing its debt under the credit facility 
the company recorded no impairment expense at december  and the company recorded impairment expense of million at december  relating to its ceiling test on the carrying costs of its oil and gas properties 
this resulted primarily from realized oil prices decreasing from at december  to at december  additionally  the company wrote off approximately million of goodwill during this goodwill resulted from the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary warren e p  inc in the methodology for testing the carrying value of goodwill was by comparing the market value of the company to the net assets of the company 
as a result of a significant decline in the market value of warren e p  inc in the fourth quarter of  it was determined that an impairment of this goodwill had occurred 
on november   warren entered into a five year  million credit agreement with merrill lynch capital on behalf of itself and a syndicate of five participating banks the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving loan up to the lesser of i the borrowing base ii million or iii the draw limit requested by the company 
the credit facility matures on november  it is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the borrowing base will be determined by the lenders at least semi annually on or about april and october of each year  and is based in part on the proved reserves of the company 
interest payments are made quarterly in arrears 
the current borrowing base is million 
the company is subject to certain covenants required by the credit facility which include  but are not limited to the maintenance of the following financial ratios a minimum current ratio including the unused borrowing base and current assets of not less than to and a minimum annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined by the credit facility to net interest expense of not less than to of to as of december   the company had borrowed million under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
if oil and gas commodity prices were to decline to lower levels  the company may become in violation of credit facility covenants in the future 
if the company fails to satisfy its credit facility covenants  it would be an event of default 
under such event of default and upon notice  all borrowings would become immediately due and payable to the lending banks 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a a base rate loan  or any other obligation other than a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin  calculated to be the higher of i the agent prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent  plus per annum  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or b a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the applicable libor period plus the applicable libor margin  that ranges from to 
during  the company incurred million of interest expense under the credit facility of which approximately million was accrued for as of december  the weighted average interest rate as of december   was 
our operations are affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions 
we have relied on the capital markets  particularly for equity securities  as well as the banking and debt markets  to meet financial commitments and liquidity needs if internally generated cash flow from operations is not adequate to fund our capital requirements 
capital markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme adverse volatility and disruption for more years  due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system  the real estate mortgage industry and the financial markets generally 
during the past months  this volatility and disruption has been reduced 
as a result  our access to capital has improved as evidenced by our million equity offering during october 
table of contents if oil commodity prices were to drop precipitously and gas commodity prices go lower  the company may not have enough liquidity to cover capital expenditures 
the availability of funds under our credit facility is critical to our company 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined on or about april  if the credit facility borrowing base is reduced to a level below current borrowings  the company would be obligated to begin reducing the deficiency by within days after the deficiency occurs and the remaining within days after the deficiency occurs 
low commodity prices may restrict our ability to meet our current obligations 
as a result  management has taken several actions to ensure that the company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through december   including a capital expenditure budget which is expected to be funded primarily by discretionary cash flow  entered into price swap agreements  collars and differential swap agreements for a portion of its production to reduce price volatility and reductions in discretionary expenditures 
as of february   approximately of the company natural gas production and of the company oil production are covered by price swaps 
if the liquidity of the company should worsen  the company would evaluate other measures to further improve its liquidity  including  the sale of equity or debt securities  entering into joint ventures with third parties  additional commodity price hedging and other monetization of assets strategies 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in these capital raising efforts if they became necessary to fund operations during during  the company had net income of million of which million represented an unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments 
this compares to when the company incurred a net loss of million of which million represented an unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments and a net loss of million in which resulted primarily from impairment charges of million relating to its oil and gas properties and goodwill 
at december   current assets were approximately million less than current liabilities 
currently  the company has a borrowing base of million and million outstanding under the credit facility 
in the future  if natural gas inventories rise to levels such that no natural gas storage capacity exists  certain us natural gas production will need to be reduced or shut in 
additionally  if commodity prices decline to levels that make it uneconomic to produce oil and natural gas  the company or its partners may elect to shut in or reduce production 
as a result  some or all of the company oil and natural gas production may be shut in or curtailed during the next months  which would have a material adverse effect on operations 
the company proved reserves increased as of december  compared to prior years 
the increase was primarily due to drilling activities and higher commodity prices 
at year end  we had revised our proved oil reserves downward by a total of  mbbls as follows due to a significant decrease in realized oil prices from per barrel at december  to per barrel at december    mbbls of proved undeveloped oil reserves in the wtu property and  mbbls of proved undeveloped oil reserves in the nwu property were deemed non economic and revised downward at year end also  due to lower realized oil prices  mbbls of proved developed producing oil reserves in the nwu were revised downward at year end as a result of these revisions  all of the proved oil reserves in the nwu were eliminated at year end in addition   mbbls of proved developed producing oil reserves in the wtu were revised downward primarily due to the decrease in realized oil prices  and  to a lesser extent  due to downward revisions to estimated oil recoveries in the wtu upper terminal and ranger waterflood projects 
lower prices decrease the economic lives of the underlying oil and natural gas properties and thereby decrease the estimated future reserves 
the company projects have material lease operating expenses 
our oil operations include a secondary recovery waterflood with significant fixed costs 
during  our oil lease operating expenses were per barrel of oil produced 
our natural gas operations include reinjecting the produced water into deep formations and compressing and transporting the gas with significant fixed costs 
during  our natural gas lease operating expenses 
table of contents were per mcf of gas produced 
the company proved reserves are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
the company proved reserves as of december  through december  are listed below 
years ended december  estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves net natural gas reserves mmcf net oil reserves mbbls total net proved natural gas oil reserves mboe estimated present value of net proved reserves pv value in thousands proved developed proved undeveloped total less future income taxes  discounted at standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in thousands prices used in calculating reserves natural gas per mcf oil per bbl proved developed reserves mboe capital expenditure program at the present time  we are concentrating our activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit 
additionally  we have a drilling project in wyoming referred to as the atlantic rim project 
during  our capital expenditure program approximated million 
the company drilled wells in california producers and injector 
the costs associated with the new oil wells in california wells were approximately million and the facility costs were approximately million 
the company purchased a sound proofed drilling rig for our wtu and nwu units in california for million and incurred million of assembly costs in the company estimates that an additional million will be spent on improvements and assembly costs in additionally  the company stimulated wells in the doty mountain unit and wells in the sun dog unit in the atlantic rim project 
these stimulations cost approximately million in total 
additionally  infrastructure costs for the gas wells in wyoming approximated million 
lastly  the company had property acquisitions of approximately million 
if the company elects not to participate in drilling activities with its partners  it may lose all or a portion of its mineral leases and rights in certain acreage 
as a result  our proved reserves may decline 
also  unless we continue to develop our properties  production may decline and  as a result  reserves would decline 
lastly  complex federal  state and local laws and regulations may adversely affect the cost and feasibility of drilling and completion activities 
in our california operations  regulations involving the disposition of water and produced natural gas associated with oil production will result in the company voluntarily curtailing oil production and could result in more material reductions of oil production in the future 

table of contents our capital expenditure budget is forecasted to be approximately million  million for our california projects and million for our wyoming projects 
however  our budget may change depending upon economic conditions  oil and gas prices and liquidity issues 
in california  we are budgeting approximately million for drilling new wtu sinusoidal wells and reworking existing wtu wells  million for infrastructure and geological costs in the wtu and nwu 
in wyoming  we are budgeting million for drilling new natural gas wells and one oil well in niobrara formation and for pipelines  compressors and infrastructure costs in our atlantic rim project 
the final determination regarding whether to drill and complete the budgeted wells and incur the capital expenditures referred to above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated crude oil and natural gas prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility and maintaining a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors 
see item a risk factors for additional risks and factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock based equity compensation plan information at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options  million had exercise prices below the closing market price of our common stock on december  of 
for additional detail about our stock based equity compensation plans  see executive compensation employee benefit plans under item and as incorporated by reference from our proxy statement on schedule a 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 

table of contents oil and gas producing activities we account for our oil and gas activities using the full cost method 
as prescribed by full cost accounting rules  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties as well as other internal costs that can be specifically identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs are depleted on the equivalent unit of production method  based on proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  warren is subject to a limitation on capitalized costs 
the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from amortization  as adjusted for related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
warren recorded a million ceiling test adjustment to earnings at december  there was no impairment charge in and the costs of certain unevaluated oil and gas properties and exploratory wells being drilled are not included in the costs subject to amortization 
warren assesses costs not being amortized for possible impairments or reductions in value and if impairments or a reduction in value has occurred  the portion of the carrying cost in excess of the current value is transferred to costs subject to amortization 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser 
warren accrues for revenue based on estimated pricing and production 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the financial statements 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales increased million during to million  a increase compared to this increase primarily resulted from an increase in oil production and an increase in realized oil prices 
net oil production for and was mbbls and mbbls  respectively 
net gas production for and was bcf and bcf  respectively 
additionally  the average realized price per barrel of oil for and was and  respectively 
the average realized price per mcf of gas for and was and  respectively 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense for increased to million per boe compared to million per boe in oil lease operating expense increased on a per barrel basis from in to per barrel in this resulted from higher costs associated with oil wells that were plugged and abandoned during gas lease operating expense decreased on a per mcf basis from in to per mcf in this resulted from a reduction in the number of gas wells that required workover procedures during depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million for to million  a increase compared to last year 
this increase resulted from increased production in compared to the depletion rate decreased to per boe compared to per boe in the decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization on a per barrel basis resulted from an increase in proved reserves at december  compared to december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in to million  a increase compared to this reflects an increase in the year end incentive compensation plan of million 
additionally  the employer portion of taxes relating to vesting stock increased million and stock option expense increased million during these increases were offset by a decrease in litigation expense of million during primarily relating to the gotham litigation discussed in more detail in note f to the financial statements commitment and contingencies 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in to million compared to the decrease results from a lower average balance outstanding under our credit facility during compared to interest and other income 
interest and other income increased million in to million  a increase compared to the same period in this increase represents an increase in the sale of scrap inventory during gain loss on derivative financial instruments 
derivative gains of million were recorded in this amount reflects million of realized gains and million of unrealized losses resulting from mark to market accounting of our oil and gas derivative positions 
derivative losses of million were recorded in this amount reflects million of realized losses and million of unrealized losses resulting from mark to market accounting of our oil and gas swaps positions 
income taxes 
we recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for temporary differences  operating loss carryforwards  statutory depletion carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards net of a valuation allowance 
the temporary differences consist primarily of depreciation  depletion and amortization of intangible and tangible drilling costs and unrealized gains on investments 

table of contents as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
also as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and subsequent years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales decreased million during to million  a decrease compared to this decrease resulted from a decrease in realized oil and gas prices

additionally  the average realized price per mcf of gas for and was and  respectively 
net oil production for and was mbbls and  mbbls  respectively 
net gas production for and was bcf and bcf  respectively 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense for decreased to million per mcfe compared to million per mcfe in primarily  this decrease reflects reduced lease operating expenses in our atlantic rim project resulting from shutting in uneconomic wells and reduced workovers on wells 
additionally  this decrease resulted from reduced field expenses in our california oil properties 
impairment 
the company recorded impairment expense of million at december  relating to its ceiling test write down of oil and gas properties 
this resulted from realized oil prices decreasing from at december  to at december  as a result  many of our proved undeveloped oil reserves became uneconomic at this oil price 
in addition  the company recorded million of goodwill impairment expense 
this goodwill related to the acquisition of the company wholly owned subsidiary warren e p  inc depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased million for to million  a decrease compared to last year 
this decrease reflects a net increase in replaced proved reserves in after factoring in production 
the depletion rate decreased to per mcfe compared to per mcfe in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was impacted by the change in the sec pricing rules from the use of year end prices to month average prices  which resulted in negative reserve revisions at december  this resulted in an increase in fourth quarter depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in to million  a decrease compared to this reflects a decrease in personnel as a result of cost cutting activities 
these decreases were offset by a million additional accrual related to gotham litigation discussed in more detail in note f to the financial statements commitment and contingencies 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million in to million compared to the increase results from a higher average balance outstanding under our credit facility during compared to interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million in to million  an decrease compared to the same period in this represents a decrease in interest earned due to lower cash and cash equivalents balances and lower interest rates as compared to the corresponding period last year 

table of contents loss on derivative financial instruments 
derivative losses of million were recorded in this amount reflects million of realized losses and million of unrealized losses resulting from mark to market accounting of our oil and gas swaps positions 
income taxes 
we recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for temporary differences  operating loss carryforwards  statutory depletion carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards net of a valuation allowance 
the temporary differences consist primarily of depreciation  depletion and amortization of intangible and tangible drilling costs and unrealized gains on investments and our investment basis in oil and gas partnerships 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
also as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our net operating loss carryforwards expire in and subsequent years 
debentures as of december   we had million of convertible secured debentures that are convertible into our common shares 
further  all convertible secured debentures are callable by us if the average bid price of our public traded common shares traded at or greater of the respective conversion price of the debentures for at least consecutive trading days 
in such an event  debentures not converted may be called by us upon days notice at a price of of par value plus accrued interest 
the principal of the convertible secured debentures is secured at maturity by zero coupon us treasury bonds previously deposited into an escrow account equaling the par value of the debentures maturing on or before the due date of the debentures 
the fair market value of these securities at december  was approximately million 
the table below reflects the outstanding convertible secured debentures by issue  the fair market value of the zero coupon us treasury bonds held in escrow on behalf of the debentures holders and the estimated cash outlay for the payment of debenture interest for the conversion prices listed below will increase in the future 
debentures outstanding at december  conversion price as of december  fair market value of us treasuries estimated debenture interest for in thousands  except conversion price data convertible secured debentures due december  convertible secured debentures due december  preferred stock as of december   we had  shares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding 
during  no shares of our convertible preferred stock converted into common shares on a to basis 
dividends and accretion on preferred shares totaled approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of our outstanding preferred stock has a dividend equal to per annum  payable to the extent legally available quarterly in arrears  and has a liquidation preference of per share 
any accrued but unpaid dividends shall be cumulative and paid upon liquidation  optional redemption or conditional repurchase 
no dividends may be paid on the common stock as long as there are any 
table of contents accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
commencing july  and thereafter  at the election of the holder of our convertible preferred stock  each share of preferred stock is convertible into share of common stock 
the conversion rate for our convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock  the combination  subdivision or reclassification of the common stock  or the distribution to all holders of common stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets  including securities issued by third parties  but excluding cash dividends or distributions paid out of surplus 
commencing seven years after their respective date of issuance  the preferred stock may be redeemed by the holders at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value of per share  plus accrued but unpaid dividends  if any 
at december   there were  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to redeem 
upon receipt of a redemption election  we  at our option  shall either pay the holder cash in an amount equal to per convertible preferred share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends or stock exchanges  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent that we have funds legally available for redemption  or issue to the holder shares of common stock in an amount equal to of the cash redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends  based on the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date of the receipt of the written redemption election by the holder  as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or by any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded 
in the event that we elect to pay the redemption price in kind with our common stock  for the  shares of preferred stock representing million of redemption price value  notwithstanding the market price of our common stock  we shall not issue to the redeeming preferred stockholders less than their proportionate share of  shares of our shares of common stock  nor be obligated to issue more than  shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of the redemption  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends and stock exchanges 
if we are not listed on an exchange or our common stock has no trading volume  upon redemption the board shall determine the fair market value of the common stock 
if the closing sale price of our publicly traded common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded  exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for the preferred stock for at least trading days during any day period  we  at our option  may either redeem the preferred stock in whole or in part  at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  or convert the preferred stock  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate  based on the average closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption 
in addition  the preferred stock  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  shall be converted into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate upon the vote or written consent of the holders of of the then outstanding preferred stock  voting together as a class 

table of contents accordingly  if the holders of any of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock request redemption and thereafter and we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock in cash  we would need capital of per share  plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends  which funds may not be available and the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial liquidity and results of operation 
alternatively  if we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock and thereafter with shares of our common stock  such issuance could materially increase the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding and be dilutive to our earnings per share  if any

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity risk our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the 
table of contents future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
in we entered into several commodity derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production 
we are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the fixed price is below the settlement price 
we believe we will have more predictability of our crude oil and gas revenues as a result of these derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of march  related to oil and gas production 
the company will receive prices as noted in the table below and will pay a counterparty market price based on the nymex for natural gas production or wti for oil production index price  settled monthly 
product type contract period volume price per mcf or bbl natural gas swap  mcf d natural gas swap  mcf d natural gas swap  mcf d crude oil costless collar bbl d crude oil costless collar bbl d natural gas costless collar  mcf d natural gas costless collar  mcf d natural gas costless collar  mcf d crude oil swap bbl d crude oil short call bbl d crude oil long call bbl d crude oil short call bbl d crude oil long call bbl d crude oil short call bbl d crude oil long call bbl d crude oil short call bbl d crude oil long call bbl d differential swap  mcf d differential swap  mcf d differential swap  mcf d the company paid  in net premiums for these calls 
this represents a differential spread between nymex and cig pricing 
interest rate risk we hold investments in us treasury bonds available for sale  which represents securities held in escrow accounts on behalf of the drilling programs and purchasers of certain debentures 
occasionally  we hold us treasury bonds trading securities  which predominantly represent us treasury bonds released from escrow accounts 
the fair market value of these securities will generally increase if the federal discount rate decreases and decrease if the federal discount rate increases 
all of our convertible debt has fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes on this debt 
at december   we had debt outstanding under our credit facility of million 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a the higher of i the agent prime 
table of contents rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent  plus per annum  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or b a eurodollar loan rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
during  the company incurred million of interest under the credit facility of which approximately million of interest was accrued for at december  at december   the weighted average interest rate on our credit line was 
a increase in this rate would result in annual additional interest of million 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bonds  collateral security accounts  derivatives and other long term liabilities 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury bonds approximate fair market value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments or they are reported at fair value 
debentures  derivatives  other long term liabilities and the credit line are recorded at the approximate fair value of such items 
inflation and changes in prices the general level of inflation affects our costs 
salaries and other general and administrative expenses are impacted by inflationary trends and the supply and demand of qualified professionals and professional services 
inflation and price fluctuations affect the costs associated with exploring for and producing natural gas and oil  which have a material impact on our financial performance
