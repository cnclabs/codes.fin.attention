item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on commercializing krystexxa pegloticase in the united states and completing the development and seeking regulatory approval outside of the united states for krystexxa  particularly in the european union 
krystexxa was approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration  or fda  on september  and became commercially available in the united states by prescription on december   when we commenced sales and shipments to our network of specialty distributors and wholesale distributors 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  in krystexxa is a pegylated enzyme that converts uric acid to allantoin 
krystexxa is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy 
chronic gout that is refractory to conventional therapy occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these drugs are contraindicated 
krystexxa is not recommended for the treatment of an elevation of blood concentration of uric acid that is not accompanied by signs or symptoms of gout  a condition referred to as asymptomatic hyperuricemia 
gout develops when urate accumulates in the tissues and joints as a result of elevated blood concentration of uric acid 
gout is usually associated with bouts of severe joint pain and disability  or gout flares  and tissue deposits of urate  or gout tophi  which may occur in concentrated forms 
patients with severe gout have an associated increased risk of kidney failure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
uricase  an enzyme not naturally expressed in humans but present in other mammals  eliminates uric acid from the body by converting uric acid to allantoin  which is easily excreted by the kidney 
we believe that treatment with krystexxa controls hyperuricemia and provides clinical benefits by eliminating uric acid in the blood and tissue deposits of urate 
based on data from the national health and nutrition examination survey  a biennial survey conducted by the us centers for disease control and prevention  we believe that there are approximately five million to eight million adults in the united states who suffer from gout 
krystexxa is indicated only for those adult patients who suffer from chronic gout and who are refractory to conventional therapy 
we currently estimate the total available market for krystexxa to be approximately  patients in the united states  although the size of the market is difficult to predict with accuracy 
in addition  the total available market opportunity for krystexxa will ultimately depend on  among other things  our marketing and sales efforts  reimbursement and market acceptance by physicians  infusion site personnel  healthcare payers and others in the medical community 
the fda granted krystexxa an orphan drug designation in  which we expect will provide the drug with orphan drug marketing exclusivity in the united states until september  seven years from the date of its approval 
the composition  manufacture and methods of use and administration of krystexxa are also the subject of a broad portfolio of patents and patent applications  which we expect  assuming issuance of currently pending patent applications  will provide patent protection through we have substantially completed our preparations for the full promotional launch of krystexxa in the united states with our sales force commencing field promotion to physicians on february  during the first quarter of  we have hired our initially planned person sales force  all with biologic drug experience  six regional business directors  six regional medical scientists and six managed care executives 
we are also planning to hire an additional field reimbursement specialists and may increase the number of sales force professionals in the future  if deemed necessary 
this sales force will allow us to target the rheumatologists and nephrologists with access to infusion centers that treat adult patients suffering from chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy 
we have built an inventory of finished krystexxa product as of december  that is packaged and labeled for distribution and additional supplies of bulk product that are scheduled to be 
table of contents packaged and labeled as part of our ongoing fda approved commercial manufacturing process 
we believe this inventory will be sufficient for us to meet internal estimates of market demand through the first quarter of to date  several large private managed care organizations have added krystexxa as a covered medical benefit and other managed care organizations are actively evaluating medical benefits coverage 
in december  we filed for a temporary c code and a permanent j code application with the us centers for medicare medicaid services for reimbursement of the cost of treatment with krystexxa 
we are also currently in contract negotiations with the us department of veterans affairs  or the va  for krystexxa to be covered for reimbursement for va member patients 
we expect to have a contract in place with the va to cover and reimburse krystexxa by the end of the first quarter of or shortly thereafter 
in support of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for krystexxa outside of the united states  we are preparing to submit a marketing authorization application  or maa  for centralized review in the european union 
in december  the pediatric committee of the european medicines agency approved our pediatric investigation plan for the treatment and prevention of hyperuricemia  which is a condition to filing for marketing approval in the european union 
we currently expect to submit our maa for krystexxa by the end of the first quarter of or soon thereafter 
we also sell and distribute branded and generic versions of oxandrolone  a drug used to promote weight gain following involuntary weight loss 
we launched our authorized generic version of oxandrolone in december in response to the approval and launch of generic competition to oxandrin  our branded version of oxandrolone 
the introduction of oxandrolone generics has led to significant decreases in demand for oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
we believe that revenues from oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone will remain flat or continue to decrease in future periods 
we currently operate within one specialty pharmaceutical segment  which includes sales of krystexxa  oxandrin and oxandrolone and the research and development activities of krystexxa 
total revenues from continuing operations were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in our board of directors appointed john h 
johnson as our chief executive officer and elected mr 
johnson to serve as a member of our board of directors  both effective january  prior to joining us  mr 
johnson served as a senior vice president of eli lilly and company and president of lilly oncology  eli lilly s oncology business unit 
from august to november  mr 
johnson was chief executive officer of imclone systems  or imclone  and served on imclone s board of directors until imclone was acquired by eli lilly and company in november prior to joining imclone  mr 
johnson served as company group chairman of johnson johnson s worldwide biopharmaceuticals unit  responsible for commercial businesses including centocor  inc  ortho biotech products  lp and the worldwide strategic marketing group 
mr 
johnson also served as president of ortho biotech products  lp we expect that paul hamelin  our president since november and previously our most senior executive officer  will continue in his current role with us through a transition period and then leave to pursue other interests 
during february  louis ferrari was appointed as our senior vice president  north america commercial 
mr 
ferrari previously served as vice president of oncology and nephrology  sales and marketing at centocor ortho biotech 
prior to that he served as vice president of clinical affairs and executive director of clinical affairs at centocor ortho biotech 
mr 
ferrari has also held positions at johnson and johnson  oxford glycosciences  ortho mcneil pharmaceutical and lilly 
mr 
ferrari earned his bachelor of science in pharmacy from the brooklyn college of pharmacy and a masters of business administration from adelphi university 
discontinued operations in july  we sold bio technology general israel ltd  or btg  a biologics manufacturing business which primarily operates in israel  to ferring pharmaceuticals  or ferring 
under the terms of the sale  ferring paid us an aggregate purchase price of million in cash and assumed specified liabilities related to the btg business 
we recorded a loss of  on the disposition of the btg business in 
table of contents revenue  operating income and income from discontinued operations  which consisted of the btg business  for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december   we incurred a million tax assessment as a result of a tax audit for the through tax years that related to corporate income tax returns filed in israel by btg 
we did not have any revenues or operating income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and these results of discontinued operations are not included in the discussion below under results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
applying these principles requires our judgment in determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic activities 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies include management estimates that are most critical to our reported financial results research and development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  stock based compensation  and costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials 
manufacturing costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors for validation and commercial batch production  process technology transfer  quality control and stability testing  raw material purchases  overhead expenses and facilities costs 
we previously recorded these manufacturing related expenses as research and development as incurred because these costs did not meet the definition of an inventory asset  as future use could not be determined based upon the uncertainty of whether krystexxa would be approved for marketing in the united states by the fda 
inventories include owned items that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business  that are in process of production for sale  or that will be consumed in the production of goods or services that will be held for sale 
on september   the fda approved krystexxa for marketing in the united states and  as a result  current and future periods can now benefit from certain manufacturing related activities relating to krystexxa 
therefore  we are now capitalizing certain manufacturing costs as an inventory asset that would previously have been expensed as research and development costs in cases where the manufacturing costs meet the definition of an inventory asset 
manufacturing costs incurred at third parties  such as merck  who we are 
table of contents trying to qualify as our secondary source supplier of pegloticase drug substance  or in jurisdictions that have not received regulatory approval for the commercialization of krystexxa  will continue to be recorded as research and development expenses 
we recorded million in research and development expenses in and that related to commercially viable krystexxa inventory on hand as of december  clinical trial costs are another significant component of research and development expenses and most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros that are milestone or event driven in nature and based on reports and invoices submitted by the cro 
these expenses are based on patient enrollment as well as costs consisting primarily of payments made to the cro  clinical sites  investigators  testing facilities and patients for participating in our clinical trials 
non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we had no deferred research and development costs as of december  and december  and had no amortization expense for the year ended december  and december  based on services performed 
all other research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred  including million and million of fees incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  to reserve manufacturing capacity at our third party suppliers manufacturing facilities  for future potential orders of krystexxa 
as a result of the fda s approval of krystexxa for marketing in the united states  we now defer and capitalize all future fees incurred to reserve manufacturing capacity at our third party suppliers 
share based compensation 
we have share based compensation plans in place and record the associated stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period 
the share based compensation plans are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compensation cost for stock options that contain service conditions is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards that contain service conditions as of the grant date by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
in addition  as future grants are made  we expect to incur additional compensation costs 
restricted stock awards that contain service conditions are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense  on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from one to four years in duration 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards that contain service conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation cost for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance or market conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
compensation expense is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest 
for purposes of recording compensation expense  we consider performance conditions that depend on a change in control event or an fda approval  once the transaction is consummated or the event occurs 
previously recognized compensation expense is fully reversed if performance targets are not satisfied 
we assess the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis and record compensation expense from that date  over the remainder of the requisite service period 
we grant stock options that contain service conditions to employees and directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock on the date that the options are 
table of contents granted 
options granted have a term of years from the grant date 
options granted to employees vest over a four year period and options granted to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period  from the date of grant 
options to directors are granted on an annual basis and represent compensation for service performance on the board of directors 
compensation cost for stock options is charged against income on a straight line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date 
we estimate the fair value of all stock option awards at the closing price on the grant date by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective  judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost 
during the years ended december   and  we issued  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and received proceeds of million  million  and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized no tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of stock option compensation cost has been charged against income 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unamortized stock option compensation which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of million related to stock option awards to senior management personnel that contain performance or market conditions  the vesting of which was contingent upon the achievement of certain specific strategic objectives by december   including fda marketing approval of krystexxa and other business development objectives 
at december   approximately  potential option shares with performance or market conditions remained unvested 
stock option awards with performance or market conditions encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through the end of and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be achieved 
we grant restricted stock awards that contain service conditions to our employees and to our directors 
restricted stock awards are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which ranges from one to four years in duration 
restricted stock awards to directors are granted on a yearly basis and represent compensation for services performed on the board of directors 
restricted stock awards to directors vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period from the grant date 
compensation cost for restricted stock awards that contain service conditions is based on the award s grant date fair value  which is the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of restricted stock at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share amounting to million in total aggregate fair market value 
during the years ended december   and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of deferred restricted stock compensation cost has been charged against income 
at december   approximately  shares remained unvested and there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that contain service conditions 
during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of million related to restricted stock awards granted in to senior management personnel that contain performance or market conditions  the vesting of which was contingent upon the achievement of certain specific strategic objectives by december   including fda marketing approval of krystexxa and other business development objectives 
we did not grant any restricted stock awards that contain performance or market conditions in at december   no potential shares of restricted stock awards with performance or market conditions issued in remained unvested 
during the year ended december   we reversed approximately million of compensation expense that was previously charged against income 
at december   approximately  potential shares of these restricted stock awards issued in previous years with performance or market conditions remained 
table of contents unvested 
restricted stock awards with performance conditions issued in previous years encompass performance targets set for senior management personnel through and could result in approximately million of additional compensation expense if the performance targets are met or expected to be achieved 
during the year ended december   we issued a restricted stock award to our former president and chief executive officer  the vesting of which was contingent upon the price of our common stock achieving a certain pre established stock price target 
we used a monte carlo simulation model to calculate both the grant date fair value and the derived requisite service period of the award 
based on the simulation  the grant date fair value of the award was calculated to be per share and compensation cost was being charged against income ratably over a two year derived requisite service period 
for restricted stock awards that contain market conditions  compensation cost is charged against income regardless of whether the market condition is ever achieved and is reversed only if the derived requisite service period is not met by the recipient of the award 
as a result of the resignation of employment of our former president and chief executive officer in november  the derived requisite service period for this award was not met  and therefore  we reversed in million of compensation expense that was previously charged against income during and income taxes 
in  we generated a net operating loss of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
we did not record an income tax provision or benefit in due to the fact that we maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
we can no longer benefit from our net operating losses at this time  as we no longer have the ability to carry back losses to previous years to recover taxes paid and future utilization of these net operating losses is uncertain 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carry forwards  we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified 
we attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature 
weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles 
less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature 
in  based on the net operating loss generated in and historical losses and the uncertainty of profitability in the near future  we concluded that we would maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets except those assets that are reserved by a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we maintained a valuation allowance as of december  of million 
the increase in valuation allowance from compared to of million is primarily due to certain return to provision adjustments  an increase in net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits and the uncertainty that these additional deferred tax assets will be realized 
we use judgment in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax positions 
additional provisions for income taxes are established when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
we are examined by federal and state tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

table of contents the total amount of federal  state  local and foreign liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december   including accrued penalties and interest 
the net increase of million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits from compared to was primarily due to additional accruals of interest and penalty expense 
the net increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a corresponding increase to the interest and penalty expense within our consolidated statements of operations as well as an increase to the deferred tax asset for which no tax benefit will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
disclosures about fair values of financial instruments 
we adopted a new accounting standard that defines fair value and establishes a framework for fair value measurements effective january  for financial assets and liabilities and effective january  for non financial assets and liabilities that are not re measured on a recurring basis 
under this standard  fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we categorize our financial instruments into a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
if the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument 
financial assets recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset 
level inputs include the following quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non active markets  inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
they reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset 
during the three months ended june   we adopted two new accounting standards that require disclosures at each interim balance sheet date of the fair value of financial instruments and valuation techniques used to determine fair value 
previously  these disclosures were only required annually 
one of these accounting standards also provides additional guidance in estimating fair value when the market volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction may not be orderly 
the adoption of these two accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value of financial instruments 
product revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from product sales 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria 
table of contents are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product is recognized at the time of sale only if i the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  ii the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  iii the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  iv the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  v the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
given our limited sales history for krystexxa coupled with the product being a new entry into its market  we believe that we are currently unable to reasonably estimate future product returns 
therefore  we have determined that the shipments of krystexxa made to specialty distributors do not meet the criteria for revenue recognition at the time of shipment  and  accordingly  such shipments are accounted for using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of krystexxa to specialty distributors 
for these product sales  we invoice the specialty distributor and record deferred revenue equal to the gross invoice price 
we then recognize revenue when krystexxa is sold through  or upon shipment of the product from the specialty distributors to their customers  including doctors and infusion suites 
because of the price of krystexxa  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and limited product return rights  krystexxa distributors and their customers generally carry limited inventory 
we also expect to sell krystexxa to wholesalers whereby we will drop ship the product directly to hospitals 
as there is limited risk of returns from hospitals as infusions will be taking place in their facilities  we plan on recording revenue when krystexxa has been received at the hospital and title has transferred in accordance with the terms of sale 
oxandrin product sales are generally recognized when title to the product has transferred to our customers in accordance with the terms of the sale 
we ship our authorized generic oxandrolone to our distributor and account for these shipments on a consignment basis until product is sold into the retail market 
we defer the recognition of revenue related to these shipments until we confirm that the product has been sold into the retail market and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our net product revenues represent total product revenues less allowances for returns  medicaid rebates  other government rebates  discounts  and distribution fees 
allowances for returns 
in general  we provide credit for product returns for krystexxa that are returned six months after the product expiration date and for oxandrin and generic oxandrolone that are returned six months prior to the product expiration date and twelve months after the product expiration date 
our product sales in the united states primarily relate to the following products product expiration in years krystexxa mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg oxandrin and oxandrolone mg upon sale  we estimate an allowance for future returns 
we provide additional reserves for contemporaneous events that were not known or knowable at the time of shipment 
in order to reasonably estimate future returns  we analyze both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates by lot productions  the level of product manufactured by us  the level of product in the distribution channel  expected shelf life of the product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of new or generic products that may erode current demand  and general economic and industry wide indicators 

table of contents the aggregate net product return allowance reserve was million as of december   and million as of december  since there were minimal sales of krystexxa in  this table primarily relates to oxandrin and oxandrolone 
a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowance for product returns is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for sales returns allowances for medicaid and other government rebates 
our contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply system commit us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the aggregate net rebate accrual balances were million as of december  and million as of december  since there were minimal sales of krystexxa in  this table primarily relates to oxandrin and oxandrolone 
a tabular roll forward of the activity related to the allowances for medicaid and other government rebates is as follows description balance at beginning of period expense provisions actual deductions other deductions balance at end of period related to current year sales related to prior period sales related to current year sales related to prior period sales in thousands allowance for rebates inventory valuation 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on actual cost 
if inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand  we record reserves for the difference between the cost and market value 
we determine these reserves based on estimates 
we continually analyze the impact of generic competition on our inventory reserves considering the oxandrin inventory currently on hand  inclusive of raw materials and finished goods  and the current demand forecasts 
the aggregate net inventory valuation reserves were million as of december  and  respectively 
results of operations during  and  we incurred substantial expenses relating to the clinical development of krystexxa 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses in  as we anticipate continued substantial expenses relating to the commercialization and further development of krystexxa 
our expenses relating to the commercialization and future development of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa in countries other than the united states  
table of contents the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  and the cost of our post approval commitments to the fda  including an observation study and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  program 
during  and  the expenses associated with our regulatory  clinical  manufacturing and commercial development of krystexxa were the most significant factors affecting our results of operations 
the following table summarizes our cost of expenses and indicates the significance of research and development costs related to our development of krystexxa as well as percentage of total cost of expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands cost of goods sold research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses our revenues for  and were derived primarily from oxandrin and our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
as a result of the increased competition to oxandrin and oxandrolone from other generic oxandrolone products  we expect our oxandrin and authorized generic oxandrolone products to remain flat or continue to decrease in future periods  and we expect oxandrin revenues to be of diminished significance to our results of operations in future periods 
our future revenues depend on our success in the commercialization of krystexxa 
the commercial success of krystexxa will depend on many factors  including when we begin a full commercial marketing campaign for krystexxa  whether we are successful in marketing and selling krystexxa once a full commercial marketing campaign begins  market acceptance of krystexxa by physicians and patients in this largely previously untreated patient population  market acceptance of the price we charge for krystexxa and under what conditions private and public payors will reimburse patients for krystexxa  whether and when we face generic or other competition with respect to krystexxa  our ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of krystexxa to meet commercial demand  and  the timing and costs of regulatory approval of krystexxa in any countries other than the united states 
the following table summarizes net product sales of our commercialized products and their percentage of total net product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands oxandrin oxandrolone krystexxa 
table of contents our financial results have been dependent on sales of oxandrin since its launch in december generic competition for oxandrin began in december and the introduction of generic products has caused a significant decrease in our oxandrin revenues  which has adversely affected us financially and has required us to scale back some of our business activities related to the product 
as a result  we anticipate that oxandrin will be a much less significant product for our future operating results 
in september  we completed a plan of termination pursuant to which we reduced our workforce by employees 
this termination was in addition to a previous termination of nine employees in august in connection with the plan of termination  we incurred charges of million 
we recorded million in severance related expenses during the quarter ended september  and an additional million of stock based compensation expense during the quarter ended december   as a result of modifications to stock option awards previously granted to the terminated employees 
the modifications included extending the term of exercisability of the vested portion of the stock options from three months following cessation of employment to six months following cessation of employment  coupled with accelerating the vesting to immediately vest any unvested stock options 
the severance related expenses resulted in cash expenditures of million during the quarter ended december  and million during the first half of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  gross sales of oxandrin decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower overall demand for the product as a result of increased generic competition 
net sales of oxandrin increased by million for the year ended december  versus the same period in  due primarily to higher prior year actual experience adjustments relating to reserves for product returns and government and customer rebates 
oxandrolone generated lower net sales for the year ended december   decreasing million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the lower sales of oxandrolone resulted from increased generic competition 
we expect that sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone will remain flat or continue to decline in future periods due to the continued impact of generic competition coupled with the expiration of our agreement with our third party supplier of these products 
krystexxa generated minimal sales during primarily because it was only made available to the marketplace during the month of december 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   mainly due to failed batches of krystexxa produced at btg during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of large research and development costs incurred in the year ended december  that did not recur in 
table of contents the year ended december   including million related to an amendment to our services agreement with merck  million of expenses related to our preparation for our june fda advisory committee meeting for krystexxa  and million in capital expenditures associated with improvements made by btg to its manufacturing facility 
in addition  research and development expenses in the year ended december  included million in higher investigator grants and outside laboratory services costs associated with the wind down of our open label extension  or ole  clinical study 
severance expense also decreased by million as a result of costs incurred in the period in connection with our september reduction in force initiative 
also contributing to the decreased costs were million in lower expenses related to a higher amount of commercial and validation batches manufactured at btg during partially offsetting the decreased expenses was an increase of million in costs associated with the validation manufacturing campaign at merck to potentially become our secondary source supplier of pegloticase drug substance 
on september   the fda approved krystexxa for marketing in the united states and  as a result  current and future periods can now benefit from certain manufacturing related activities relating to krystexxa 
therefore  we are now capitalizing certain manufacturing costs as an inventory asset that would previously have been expensed as research and development costs in cases where the manufacturing costs meet the definition of an inventory asset 
manufacturing costs incurred at third parties or in jurisdictions that have not received regulatory approval for the commercialization of krystexxa will continue to be recorded as research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was partially due to lower marketing costs incurred during the year ended december  that did not recur in the year ended december   including million associated with the preparation for a possible commercial launch of krystexxa in additionally  the lower costs reflected a decrease of million in compensation related and severance expenses as a result of the reduction in force implemented in september additionally  our outside legal costs in support of the shareholder class action litigation decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  investment income expense  net investment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a realized gain of million recorded during the year ended december  resulting from redemptions of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  or the portfolio 
other income expense  net other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability in the current year which resulted in a million loss due to the appreciation in fair market value of our warrants 
the appreciation in fair market value of the warrants during the year ended december  resulted from a higher price per share of our common stock 
additionally  we recorded a million loss on the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability during the year ended december  resulting from appreciation in the fair market value of our warrants during the prior year 
all of the warrants have been exercised and none remain outstanding as of december  income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million to for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  the decrease of benefit in is a direct result of our 
table of contents inability to carry back losses to previous years to recover previously paid taxes 
it is uncertain whether we will be able to utilize the net operating losses generated in against future income 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from lower net product sales of oxandrin and oxandrolone 
gross sales of oxandrin decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower overall demand for the product as a result of increase generic competition 
net sales of oxandrin were flat as compared to the prior year due to higher prior year experience adjustments relating to reserves for product returns and government and customer rebates 
oxandrolone net sales were lower by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to an increase in gross sales of our authorized generic version of oxandrolone 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to million in lower manufacturing related expenses including million of decreased technology transfer expenses at diosynth as the majority of the work was completed in the prior year 
partially offsetting the lower technology transfer expenses were higher costs of million for commercial batch production at btg 
the decrease in research and development expenses was also due to million in lower clinical studies and research as a result of the wind down of the ole study in coupled with a toxicology study performed in the prior year 
additionally  we incurred million in lower compensation expenses due to decreased headcount resulting from the plan of termination implemented in september and million of lower consulting  medical writing and data management services associated with the preparation of our biologic license application  or bla  filing for krystexxa 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in severance costs related to the plan of termination in september and other terminated employees during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses as a result of our patent infringement litigation with upsher smith laboratories  and the settlement of a lawsuit with a former executive relating to his entitlement to severance payments and benefits upon termination of his employment  both occurring in additionally  marketing expenses for the preparation of the commercial launch of krystexxa decreased by approximately million as these expenses wound down as a result of the previous expectation and preparation for a commercial launch in september 
table of contents investment income investment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in dividend and interest income driven by lower average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances and as a result of lower yields earned on these investments due to a change in the investment strategy focused on capital retention 
other expense  net other expense  net increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the mark to market valuation adjustment to our warrant liability of million for the year ended december   to record a loss due to the appreciation in fair market value of our warrants as a result of a higher underlying common stock price since the date of issuance of the warrants 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million  to a benefit of million for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit reflects the expected tax effect of carrying back an increased portion of our alternative minimum tax net operating loss to our and tax years to recover the remaining alternative minimum income tax liability of million that is eligible to be refunded for those tax years  as well as a million benefit due to a reversal of a liability for unrecognized tax benefit caused by a lapse in statute 
the opportunity for carry back became available due to section b h and b of the internal revenue code which was amended under section of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december  after giving effect to our receipt of net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in february  we estimate that we would have had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  on a pro forma basis 
we primarily invest our cash equivalents and short term investments in highly liquid  interest bearing  us treasury money market funds and bank certificates of deposit in order to preserve principal 
in february  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the aggregate principal amount of notes sold reflects the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase million principal amount of notes to cover over allotments 
the notes bear cash interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on august  the notes will mature on february  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock under specified circumstances  initially at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
we may not redeem the notes prior to february  on or after february  and prior to the maturity date  we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds of the issuance of the notes to commercialize krystexxa in the united states  including completion of our ongoing efforts to recruit a sales force  expand our marketing organization and establish a commercial infrastructure  to fund clinical development activities directed to potential label expansion for krystexxa in the united states  to further develop and seek regulatory approval for krystexxa in jurisdictions outside the united states  particularly in the european union  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
we have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of 
table of contents the areas listed above or the timing of these expenditures  and the expected corporate purposes listed above may change at any time 
as a result  our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering 
pending the application of the net proceeds  we intend to invest the net proceeds in short term us government security money market funds 
in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
we are continuing to use the net proceeds from the offering to develop a program of regulatory filings and review of krystexxa in other countries  to engage a global secondary source supplier and a secondary fill and finish manufacturer for krystexxa and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on april   we raised million through a registered direct offering of our common stock  which yielded approximately million in cash net of approximately million of offering costs  which were charged to additional paid in capital 
we issued  shares of our common stock to existing and new institutional investors as part of the offering 
the investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the warrants were exercisable at any time after the date of issuance and on november  during the year ended december   holders of our warrants exercised warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  either through a cashless exercise or cash exercise 
we received an aggregate of million of cash proceeds from the cash exercises of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the remainder of the warrants were exercised via a cashless net share settlement process  whereby warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were exercised  resulting in the forfeiture of  shares in satisfaction of the warrant exercise price  and the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of december   all of the warrants had been exercised and no warrants to purchase shares of our common stock remained outstanding 
as all of the warrants have been exercised and none remain outstanding  our warrant liability had been completely converted into stockholders equity as of december  based on our current plans for launching krystexxa  including our anticipated expenses for building a commercial infrastructure  sales and marketing expenses  the cost of purchasing additional inventory  and the cost of pursuing additional development and filing for regulatory approval in the european union  and assuming that we are able to generate krystexxa revenues at the level that we are currently expecting  we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations for at least the next two years 
we believe we have sufficient quantities of krystexxa for a commercial launch in accordance with our launch plan 
we also believe that this inventory will be sufficient for us to meet market demand through the first quarter of however  we had to destroy certain launch quantity finished product batches of krystexxa previously manufactured as a result of the deficiencies cited by the fda in its july  complete response letter to us responding to our krystexxa bla  and our decision to revert to the phase manufacturing process 
these batches of krystexxa will not be available for commercial distribution and  except for portions of these batches being utilized for stability and other analytical testing  the remaining quantities of this finished product were destroyed 
we incurred approximately million of cash outlays during and to replace these launch quantities of finished product 
the costs for these finished product batches were expensed as incurred as research and development expenses within our consolidated statements of operations when the batches were manufactured 
tax benefits for the year ended december   we had a net operating loss for federal income taxes of million 
we currently don t benefit from this net operating loss as we no longer have the ability to carry back losses to previous years to recover taxes paid 
it is uncertain that we will be able to utilize these net operating losses against future income 
on october  we were awarded a million grant for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project under the patient protection and affordable care act 
this grant is intended to assist in the advancement of our krystexxa ongoing therapeutic and commercialization project 
this project 
table of contents was awarded million based on the spending of million of qualifying expenses incurred by us 
the total amount awarded was received and recognized as grant revenue during the fourth quarter of cash flows cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflects our net loss for the period of million partially offset by a net non cash adjustment of million as a result of the mark to market valuation of our warrant liability and the reclassification to equity  upon the exercise of the warrants 
partially offsetting the cash outflows above was the million refund received in february of income taxes paid in prior years and the million grant received in november from the department of treasury for our qualifying therapeutic discovery project under the patient protection and affordable care act 
the recovery in february of prior alternative minimum income taxes is the result of an amendment of section b h and b of the internal revenue code  which was amended under section of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of we used million in investment activities relating primarily to the purchase of held to maturity securities encompassing bank certificates of deposit 
we also received million in cash from financing activities  mainly due to the issuance of common stock  including million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants 
for the year ended december   we used net cash of million in operating activities 
this consisted of a net loss for the period of million  partially offset by million in cash received from our us federal income tax refund as a result of the carry back of our federal net operating losses against taxable income and a non cash charge of million as a result of the mark to market valuation of our warrant liability 
we received million from investment activities resulting primarily from the full liquidation of our investment in the portfolio in the proceeds from the redemptions were re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
we also received million in cash from financing activities  million resulting from net proceeds from our registered direct offering in april  million resulting from net proceeds from our underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock in october  and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily due to the exercise of stock options in november  we used million in cash to purchase an investment in the portfolio  which was classified on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted short term and long term investments 
in december  columbia management  a unit of bank of america  closed the portfolio to new investments and redemptions and began an orderly liquidation and dissolution of the portfolio s assets for distribution to the unit holders  thereby restricting our potential to invest in and withdraw from the portfolio 
during and  the entire investment was redeemed and re invested in cash and cash equivalents and used to fund operations 
in september  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from certain executive level employees in order to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans  for an aggregate cost to us of million 
funding requirements we are now focusing our efforts on commercializing krystexxa which was made available by prescription in the united states on december   and completing the development and seeking regulatory approval outside of the united states for krystexxa 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including when we begin a full commercial marketing campaign for krystexxa  the cost of our post approval commitments to the fda  including an observational study and a rems program  
table of contents the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  whether we are successful in marketing and selling krystexxa once a full commercial marketing campaign begins  market acceptance of krystexxa by physicians and patients in a largely previously untreated patient population  market acceptance of the price that we charge for krystexxa and whether and under what conditions private and public payors will reimburse patients for krystexxa  and the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for krystexxa in countries other than the united states 
as we are planning to independently pursue the commercialization of krystexxa  our cash needs will increase  and we may need to seek additional funding 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  such funding may not be on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we issue preferred stock  it would likely include a liquidation preference and other terms that would adversely affect our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  we may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to take specified actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
if additional funds are not available on favorable terms  or at all  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  and we may be required to curtail or cease operations 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitment obligations other commitments total purchase commitment obligations represent our contractually obligated minimum purchase requirements based on our current manufacturing and supply and other agreements in place with third parties

other commitments represent accrued severance costs related to separation agreements with several former employees as well as sales based milestone payments that will become due and payable to duke and mvp on the attainment of specific krystexxa sales targets  the timing of which is based on our best estimates and could shift from period to period 
sales based royalty payments to duke and mvp are not included in the table above due to the contingent nature of such obligations 
the royalty rate owed to duke and mvp 
table of contents for any particular quarter ranges between and of net sales based on the amount of cumulative net sales made by us 
we are also required to pay royalties of of any milestones  revenue or other consideration we receive from sub licensees during any quarter 
we have received financial grants in support of research and development from the office of the chief scientist of the state of israel  or ocs  and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation  or bird  of approximately million and million  respectively for the development of krystexxa 
these grants are subject to repayment through royalties on the commercial sales of krystexxa 
the ocs grants were received by our former subsidiary  btg  and upon our divestiture of btg to ferring  we agreed to remain obligated to reimburse btg for its repayments to ocs that relate to the krystexxa financial grants 
in addition  under the israeli law of encouragement of research and development in industry  as amended  as a result of the funding received from ocs  if we do not manufacture of our krystexxa annual worldwide bulk product requirements in israel  we may be subject to total payments ranging from to of the repayment obligation plus interest  based upon the percentage of manufacturing that does not occur in israel 
our aggregate principal repayment obligation plus interest to ocs and bird if  as per our agreements with btg and diosynth  manufacture more that of our annual worldwide bulk product requirements outside of israel  would range between million and million at december  these payments have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainties surrounding the potential future cash flows from the commercialization of krystexxa 
we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  we are unable to estimate the exact amount or the timing of payments  if any  relating to this liability
