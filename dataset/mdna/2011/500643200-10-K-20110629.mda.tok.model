critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
fees earned in excess of the initial contract amount are billed upon completion of the engagement  which reflects the final actual compensation of the placed executive 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
fee revenue from ltc services is recognized as earned 
furthermore  a provision for doubtful accounts on recognized revenue is established with a charge to general and administrative expenses based on historical loss experience  assessment of 
table of contents the collectability of specific accounts  as well as expectations of future collections based upon trends and the type of work for which services are rendered 
annual incentive compensation 
each quarter  management records its best estimate of its annual incentive compensation  which on a quarterly basis requires management to  among other things  project annual consultant productivity as measured by engagement fees billed and collected by that consultant  our performance  competitive forces and future economic conditions and their impact on our results 
at the end of each fiscal year  bonuses paid take into account final individual consultant productivity  our results  the achievement of strategic objectives and the results of individual performance appraisals  as determined by management  and the current economic landscape 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying the quarterly bonus accrual may significantly impact the compensation and benefits liability on our balance sheet and related compensation and benefits cost on our statement of operations 
differences between the assumptions used each quarter to estimate annual incentive compensation and actual cash payments made on an annual basis could materially impact the carrying amount of the liability and our operating results 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
during fiscal  we recognized foreign currency gains  on an after tax basis  of million as compared to fiscal and  in which we recognized foreign currency losses  on an after tax basis  of million and million  respectively 
our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  if the us dollar weakened by the same increments against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  correspondingly  our exchange gain would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under our facility 
we had million and million of borrowings against the csv of coli contracts as of april  and  respectively  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the csv on our coli contracts
