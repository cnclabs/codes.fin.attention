item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the financial crisis affecting the global economy has created historic volatility in the market place 
our working capital is invested primarily in money market funds  so that liquidity has not been materially affected 
the crisis did have the effect of reducing participation in the securities market by our retail and institutional customers  which has had an adverse effect on our revenues 
our affiliate  siebert  brandford  shank co  llc had a record year in by increasing its market share and participating in more transactions as senior and co managers 
our expenses include the costs of an arbitration proceeding commenced by a former employee following the termination of his employment  which remains unresolved 
the company believes that the action is without merit  but the costs of defense  which are included as professional expenses  have adversely affected the company s results of operations and may continue to affect the results of operations until the action is completed 
the following table sets forth certain metrics as of december  and and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  which we use in evaluating our business 
for the twelve months ended december  retail customer activity total retail trades average commission per retail trade as of december  retail customer balances retail customer net worth in billions retail customer money market fund value in billions retail customer margin debit balances in millions retail customer accounts with positions description total retail trades represent retail trades that generate commission 
average commission per retail trade represents the average commission generated for all types of retail customer trades 
retail customer net worth represents the total value of securities and cash in the retail customer accounts before deducting margin debits 
retail customer money market fund value represents all retail customers accounts invested in money market funds 
retail customer margin debit balances represents credit extended to our customers to finance their purchases against current positions 
retail customer accounts with positions represents retail customers with cash and or securities in their accounts 
we  like other securities firms  are directly affected by general economic and market conditions including fluctuations in volume and prices of securities  changes and the prospect of changes in interest rates  and demand for brokerage and investment banking services  all of which can affect our profitability 
in addition  in periods of reduced financial market activity  profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed  including salaries and related costs  portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses 
accordingly  earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period 
competition continues to intensify among all types of brokerage firms  including established discount brokers and new firms entering the on line brokerage business 
electronic trading continues to account for an increasing amount of trading activity  with some firms charging very low trading execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet 
some of these brokers  however  impose asset based charges for services such as mailing  transfers and handling exchanges which we do not currently impose  and also direct their orders to market makers where they have a financial interest 
continued competition could limit our growth or even lead to a decline in our customer base  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
industry wide changes in trading practices  such as the continued use of electronic communications networks  are expected to put continuing pressure on commissions fees earned by brokers while increasing volatility 
we are a party to an operating agreement the operating agreement  with suzanne shank and napoleon brandford iii  the two individual principals the principals of sbs financial products company llc  a delaware limited liability company sbsfpc

on january   our board of directors authorized a buy back of up to  shares of our common stock 
under this program  shares are purchased from time to time  at our discretion  in the open market and in private transactions 
during we repurchased  shares of common stock for an average price of 
critical accounting policies we generally follow accounting policies standard in the brokerage industry and believe that our policies appropriately reflect our financial position and results of operations 
our management makes significant estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities included in the financial statements 
the estimates relate primarily to revenue and expense items in the normal course of business as to which we receive no confirmations  invoices  or other documentation  at the time the books are closed for a period 
we use our best judgment  based on our knowledge of revenue transactions and expenses incurred  to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses 
we are not aware of any material differences between the estimates used in closing our books for the last five years and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when we subsequently receive the actual confirmations  invoices or other documentation 
estimates are also used in determining the useful lives of intangibles assets  and the fair market value of intangible assets 
our management believes that its estimates are reasonable
