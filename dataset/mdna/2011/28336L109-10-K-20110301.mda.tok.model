our business we provide natural gas and related energy products in a safe  efficient and dependable manner 
we own or have interests in north america s largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems  which provide a stable base of earnings and cash flow and have a backlog of committed expansion projects 
we are also a large independent natural gas and oil producer focused on generating competitive financial returns through disciplined capital allocation and portfolio management  cost control and marketing and selling our natural gas and oil production at optimal prices while managing associated price risks 
we also have an emerging midstream business 
factors influencing our profitability 
our pipeline operations are rate regulated and accordingly we generate profit based on our ability to earn a return in excess of our costs through the rates we charge our customers 
our exploration and production operations generate profits dependent on the prices for natural gas and oil  the costs to explore  develop  and produce natural gas and oil  and the volumes we are able to produce  among other factors 
our long term profitability in each of our operating segments will be primarily influenced by the following factors pipelines executing successfully on our remaining backlog of committed expansion projects and developing new growth projects in our market and supply areas  contracting and recontracting pipeline capacity with our customers  maintaining or obtaining approval by the ferc of acceptable rates  terms of service  and expansion projects  and improving operating efficiency 

table of contents exploration and production growing our natural gas and oil proved reserve base and production volumes through successful low risk drilling programs  finding and producing natural gas and oil at a reasonable cost  and managing price risks to optimize realized prices on our natural gas and oil production 
in addition to these factors  our future profitability will be affected by the impacts of volatility in the financial and commodity markets  our debt level and related interest costs  the successful resolution of our historical contingencies and other legacy activities 
summary of performance during  we generated significant earnings in both our pipeline and exploration and production businesses and continued to focus on delivering on our remaining backlog of pipeline expansion projects  and achieving operational success in our exploration and production business 
during  in our pipeline business  we placed approximately billion of pipeline expansion projects into service  all on time and in total approximately million under budget 
we also continued to advance our ruby project  our largest pipeline expansion project  which we currently expect to go into service in july at an updated total cost of approximately billion 
in our exploration and production business  we have continued executing on our strategy  with increased production volumes  lower per unit cash operating costs  and an expanded and hedging program designed to support our balance sheet and cash flows 
we commenced shifting our capital program in to provide us more exposure to oil opportunities  particularly in the altamont  eagle ford and wolfcamp areas 
we believe the stability of our pipeline earnings coupled with the hedging program in our exploration and production business will continue to protect our earnings base and cash flows from operations 
the following table provides highlights in our core businesses and financing activities area of operations significant highlights pipelines completed a billion project financing facility on our ruby pipeline expansion project  received final approval from the ferc  and began construction of the project progressed on our remaining backlog of expansion projects completing five expansion projects on time and on or under budget  including phase a of both the slng elba expansion iii and the elba express pipeline expansion  the cig raton expansion  the wic system expansion and phase i of the sng south system iii project received billion in cash in conjunction with contributing ownership interests in slng  elba express and sng to our mlp funded through the issuance of mlp debt and unit issuances sold interests in certain mexican pipeline and compression assets for approximately billion filed new rate cases with the ferc for our epng and tgp systems exploration and production achieved an overall domestic drilling success rate of percent focused our domestic capital program on our core programs including the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana and east texas  the eagle ford shale in south texas and the altamont fractured tight sands in utah 
in late  we also acquired  net acres in the wolfcamp shale in the permian basin in texas 
managed commodity price risk through derivative contracts on  and natural gas production increased oil and liquids based revenues in to percent of our total revenues  an percent increase from 
table of contents we also entered into a joint venture in our emerging midstream business and sold a percent interest in our altamont gathering and processing assets for million in cash 
under the venture  we and our partner expect to each invest up to approximately million in future midstream projects 
while our current level of earnings from our midstream business is not significant  there are a number of projects we are evaluating  and believe that the movement to more unconventional supply basins will present future opportunities in this business 
outlook for in  we expect that our pipeline operations will continue to provide a strong base of earnings and operating cash flow 
approximately percent of our pipeline revenues are collected in the form of demand or reservation charges  which are not dependent upon commodity prices or throughput levels 
this  coupled with the diversity of our pipeline systems  helps mitigate against the risk of changes in throughput and ongoing shifts in supply and demand 
during  we experienced lower demand and firm transportation commitments on our epng system and long haul transportation being replaced by short haul transportation on our tgp system 
additionally as a result of the shift in flow patterns of our tgp system  we experienced lower realized prices and volumes of gas not used in operations 
our pipeline results are also impacted by rate cases 
currently  two of our pipelines have outstanding rate cases pending before the ferc and certain of our other pipelines have projected upcoming rate actions with anticipated effective dates from through our pipeline capital expenditure program is expected to be approximately billion  including billion on our remaining backlog of growth projects 
we currently plan to place five more projects in service by the end of in our exploration and production business  we also expect to generate significant earnings and operating cash flow 
our planned average daily production for is expected to range between mmcfe d and mmcfe d  including approximately mmcfe d from our ownership interest in the production of four star 
we expect the trend of low natural gas prices to continue and have expanded our financial derivative contracts in place for providing average floors on approximately percent of our estimated domestic natural gas production and per barrel collars on approximately percent of our estimated oil production 
we have also expanded our natural gas and oil hedge program 
our oil and natural gas production hedge programs will help protect our cash flows in these years 
in addition  we have focused on execution and cost management to ensure favorable economics of our programs in the current low gas price environment 
in our exploration and production business  we expect to spend approximately billion in capital expenditures during with percent focused domestically in our haynesville  altamont  eagle ford  and wolfcamp areas 
this capital focus provides us greater exposure to both oil and natural gas liquids opportunities 
we are considering securing a joint venture partner for our eagle ford oil acreage to accelerate development of this core area and deliver higher returns on invested capital 
in our emerging midstream business  we will continue to seek out opportunities that focus on synergies with our pipeline and or exploration and production businesses  funding these projects in a manner that is consistent with our long term goal of improving our balance sheet  including the evaluation of partnership opportunities on our projects 
as of december   we had approximately billion of available liquidity exclusive of cash and credit facility capacity of epb and ruby 
we expect our available liquidity and operating cash flows in to be sufficient to fund our estimated billion capital program 
in we also have debt maturities of approximately million which we will pay off as they mature 
additionally  before the end of we will be required to renew our three primary revolving credit facilities 
as a result of our actions  our current available liquidity  hedging program in place on our natural gas and oil production  and planned future actions including continuing with our mlp drop down strategy as market conditions permit  we believe we are well positioned in to meet our obligations as well as continue with our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet 
we will continue to assess and take further actions where prudent to meet our long term objectives and capital requirements as well as address any changes in the financial and commodity markets and our businesses

table of contents results of operations overview we have two core operating business segments  pipelines and exploration and production 
we also have a marketing segment that markets our natural gas and oil production and manages legacy trading contracts 
our segments are managed separately  provide a variety of energy products and services  and require different technology and marketing strategies 
prior to  we also had a power segment which has been combined into our corporate and other activities for all periods presented 
our corporate and other activities include our general and administrative functions  and other miscellaneous businesses  including our newly formed midstream business 
our management uses earnings before interest expense and income taxes ebit as a measure to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business segments  which consist of both consolidated businesses and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe ebit is useful to our investors because it allows them to evaluate more effectively our operating performance using the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management and so that our investors may evaluate our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure 
we define ebit as net income loss adjusted for items such as i interest and debt expense  ii income taxes and iii net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
ebit may not be comparable to measures used by other companies 
additionally  ebit should be considered in conjunction with net income loss  income loss before income taxes and other performance measures such as operating income or operating cash flows 
below is a reconciliation of our ebit by segment to our consolidated net income loss for each of the three years ended december in millions pipelines exploration and production marketing corporate and other ebit interest and debt expense income tax benefit expense net income loss attributable to el paso corporation net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss the discussions that follow provide additional analysis of the year over year results of each of our business segments  our corporate activities and other income statement items 

table of contents pipelines segment overview our pipelines segment operates in the united states and consists of interstate natural gas transmission  storage and lng terminalling related services 
we face varying degrees of competition in this segment from other existing and proposed pipelines and proposed lng facilities  as well as from alternative energy sources used to generate electricity such as hydroelectric power  nuclear energy  wind  solar  coal and fuel oil 
our revenues from transportation  storage  and lng terminalling related services consist of two types percent of type description revenues reservation reservation revenues are from customers referred to as firm customers that reserve capacity on our pipeline systems  storage facilities or lng terminalling facilities 
these firm customers are obligated to pay a monthly reservation or demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they transport or store  for the term of their contracts 
usage and other usage revenues are from both firm customers and interruptible customers those without reserved capacity that pay usage charges and provide fuel in kind based on the volume of gas actually transported  stored  injected or withdrawn 
we also earn revenues from the processing and sale of natural gas liquids and other miscellaneous sources 
the ferc regulates the rates we can charge our customers 
these rates are generally a function of the cost of providing services to our customers  including a reasonable return on our invested capital 
because of our regulated nature and the high percentage of our revenues attributable to reservation charges  our revenues have historically been relatively stable 
however  our financial results can be subject to volatility due to factors such as changes in natural gas prices  changes in supply and demand  changes in gas flows  regulatory actions  competition  weather and declines in the creditworthiness of our customers 
we also experience earnings volatility on one of our pipelines when the amount of natural gas used in our operations differs from the amounts we receive for that purpose 
historically  much of our business was conducted through long term contracts with customers 
however  many of our customers have shifted from a traditional dependence on long term contracts to a portfolio approach  which balances short term opportunities with long term commitments 
this shift  which can increase the volatility of our revenues  is due to changes in market conditions and competition driven by state utility deregulation  local distribution company mergers  new supply sources  volatility in natural gas prices  demand for short term capacity and new power plant markets 
we continue to manage the process of renewing expiring contracts to limit the risk of significant impacts on our revenues 
our ability to extend existing customer contracts or remarket expiring contracted capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives  the regulatory environment at the federal  state and local levels and the market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire 
the duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices  competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility 
although we attempt to recontract or remarket our capacity at the maximum rates allowed under our tariffs  we frequently enter into firm transportation contracts at amounts that are less than these maximum rates to remain competitive 
the extent that these amounts are less than the maximum rates varies for each of our pipeline systems 
our existing contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity 
the weighted average remaining contract term for our active contracts is approximately six years as of december  
table of contents below are the contract expiration portfolio and the associated revenue expirations for our firm transportation contracts on our wholly and majority owned systems as of december   including those with terms beginning in or later contracted capacity percent of total bbtu d percent of total reservation revenue reservation revenue in millions and beyond total summary of operational and financial performance our ebit increased approximately percent when comparing both the year ended december  with and compared to in both and our ebit benefited from expansion projects placed into service and an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction related to pipeline expansion projects not yet in service  such as our ruby project 
however  during both periods  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also increased as a result of contributing assets to epb coupled with a decline in revenues from the epng and tgp systems 
during  we plan to spend billion in capital on our pipeline business  including billion on our remaining backlog of expansion projects 
our most significant projects are listed below  grouped by anticipated in service dates 
cumulative project spend anticipated in service total estimated as of project dates project costs december  ferc approved in billions fgt phase viii expansion april yes ruby pipeline july yes south system iii and southeast supply header phase ii june june yes gulf lng clean energy october yes tgp line project november yes and beyond tgp northeast upgrade project november no these projects have substantial contractual commitments with customers but are not fully contracted 
amounts represent our proportional share of the estimated costs for these unconsolidated affiliates 
our estimated equity contribution is included in our expected capital plan 
amount includes percent of our ruby pipeline project expenditures 
as of december   we have received approximately billion in funding from our equity partner on this project 
the south system iii expansion project consists of three phases 
in january  phase i of the project was placed in service 
phases ii and iii are expected to be placed in service in june and june  respectively 
phase ii of the southeast supply header project is expected to be placed in service in june amount includes approximately million that we paid to acquire a percent interest in this project 

table of contents listed below is additional information related to certain of our significant backlog projects ruby pipeline project 
the ruby pipeline project consists of approximately miles of pipeline and multiple compressor stations with total horsepower of approximately  we have bcf d contractually committed on a firm basis from customers for to years out of a total design capacity of bcf d 
in  we received a blm right of way grant for the project  final approval from the ferc and began construction of the pipeline 
several groups have filed appeals with the us court of appeals of certain approvals and actions of the ferc  blm and the us fish and wildlife service related to the project 
although we are currently able to continue construction of the pipeline pending the federal court of appeals review of the petitions  we are currently unable to predict what action  if any  the court will take in response to these appeals or any subsequent filings that may be made by one or more of these groups 
construction of the ruby pipeline project continues to advance  with approximately percent of the pipe welded 
in order to avoid interference with the sage grouse during its mating season in certain areas of a mile portion of the route in nevada  construction will be suspended in this area from march to may of we have updated our cost estimate and now expect the project to be completed at a cost of approximately billion and be placed in service in july although we have made substantial progress in constructing the pipeline  our ability to complete the project by this date and within these estimated costs will continue to depend on factors outside of our control  including any delays in obtaining additional regulatory clearances  any adverse court determinations with regard to existing regulatory clearances  adverse weather conditions and our ability to complete construction activities during certain work periods provided for in our regulatory authorizations 
tgp line project 
all of the firm transportation capacity resulting from this project in the northeast us market area is fully subscribed with one shipper based on an executed precedent agreement 
during  the ferc issued a favorable environmental assessment and tgp received certificate authorization from the ferc to construct the pipeline and compression facilities 
in june  we commenced construction on our compression facilities related to this project  with construction of the remaining facilities to occur in tgp northeast upgrade project 
in  tgp entered into precedent agreements with two shippers to provide mmcf d of additional firm transportation service from receipt points in the marcellus shale basin to an interconnect in new jersey 
all of the firm transportation capacity is fully subscribed with these two shippers 
in order to accommodate the additional service  we will pursue this project which includes approximately miles of inch pipeline looping and approximately  horsepower of additional compression 
successful execution on our committed pipeline backlog will continue to require effective project management 
we attempt to mitigate the market risk associated with our expansion projects through subscribing a substantial portion of the capacity under long term contracts with investment grade customers and purchasing or committing to purchase steel at fixed prices as well as contracting a significant portion of the construction costs

expansions 
during and  we benefited from increased reservation revenues due to expansion projects placed in service 
these projects included the carthage expansion  the totem gas storage facility  the concord lateral expansion  the wic system expansion  phase a of both the slng elba expansion iii and elba express pipeline expansion  and the cig raton expansion 
we capitalize a carrying cost afudc on equity funds related to our construction of long lived assets 
during the years ended december  and  we benefited from an increase in other income of approximately million and million associated with the equity portion of afudc on our expansion projects 
this increase was primarily due to our ruby pipeline project in and our slng elba expansion iii and elba express pipeline expansion projects in subsequent to placing expansion projects in service  our level of earnings will depend on the level of contracted customer capacity and our ability to market unsubscribed firm capacity 
currently  approximately bcf d on our ruby pipeline project is subscribed and we do not expect additional firm capacity subscriptions in the near term 
until placed in service  our ruby project will be consolidated in our financial results 
we currently fund and reflect percent of the capital cost of this project  including cost overruns  in our results which reflect higher afudc capitalized due to project delays 
shortly after completion of this project  subject to meeting certain conditions  we anticipate reflecting ruby in our financial statements as an equity investment in which we own percent 
once deconsolidated  we will be required to evaluate our investment in ruby for impairment 
based on increased costs and delays in project completion which impact the net book value of our investment  depending on the fair value at the time of evaluation  we may be required to write down a portion of our investment in ruby 
additionally  we will reflect equity earnings from ruby in ebit after the impact of interest expense and taxes and preferred interests 
as such  our ebit contribution from ruby will decline once the pipeline is placed in service 

table of contents reservation and usage revenues 
our reservation and usage revenues variance  when comparing the three year period ended december   primarily relates to changes on our epng  tgp and sng pipeline systems as further discussed in the table below in millions and discussion that follows 
pipeline system to to epng tgp sng other total increases primarily due to higher tariff rates effective september  due to sng s rate case settlement 
consists of individually insignificant items on our other pipeline systems 
during  epng experienced increased contracted capacity to its primary delivery points in california which resulted in higher reservation revenues of approximately million when compared to however  epng s throughput volumes decreased in and due to lower natural gas and electric generation demand resulting from weak macroeconomic conditions in the southwestern us  increased competition in its california and arizona market areas  including increased activity from an lng facility and reduced basis differentials which unfavorably impacted our ebit by million and million when compared with prior periods 
on our tgp system  when comparing to  our overall ebit was unfavorably impacted by a million decrease in activity under various interruptible services and lower demand from increased competition in the southeast area and milder weather partially offset by executed transportation capacity contracts with shippers primarily from the marcellus shale basin in the northeast market area which increased our reservation revenues by approximately million when compared with throughput volumes on our tgp system increased during compared to however  our reservation and usage revenues were lower by approximately million primarily because long haul transports on our tgp system have decreased due to a shift in receipts from the gulf coast region to the rockies express pipeline interconnect in ohio and the marcellus shale basin  which is short haul transportation and subject to lower rates 
we believe our marcellus expansion projects tgp line project  tgp northeast upgrade project and tgp northeast supply diversification project will expand our presence from marcellus to the new york and new england markets 
throughput can affect our level of revenues from commodity charges  and items such as changes in gas flows on our tgp and epng systems  or be an indication of the risks we may face when seeking to recontract or renew any of our existing firm transportation contracts 
continuing negative economic impacts on demand  as well as adverse shifting of sources of supply  could negatively impact basis differentials and our ability to renew firm transportation contracts that are expiring on our systems or our ability to renew such contracts at current rates 
although this risk exists for all of our pipelines  it is the most significant on our epng system where we may be required to further discount certain transportation rates in order to renew certain firm transportation contracts should these conditions continue 
if we determine there is significant change in our revenues  costs or billing determinants on any of our pipeline systems  we have the option to file rates cases with the ferc on certain of our pipelines to provide an opportunity to recover our prudently incurred costs 
during  epng and tgp filed rate cases with the ferc 
although these rate cases are intended to address significant factors leading to the loss in revenues or increased costs  they will not eliminate all ongoing business risks including competition and shifts in throughput 
gas not used in operations and revaluations 
for the year ended december  when compared with  our ebit was unfavorably impacted by million due to lower realized prices and lower volumes of gas not used in operations as a result of the shift in flow patterns primarily on our tgp system  partially offset by million of lower electric compression usage 
higher realized prices on operational sales and lower imbalance revaluations contributed favorably to our ebit by approximately million in compared to in addition  lower electric compression usage increased our ebit by million for the year ended december  when compared to our future earnings may be impacted positively or negatively depending on changes in throughput  as well as fluctuations in natural gas prices 
we continue to explore options to minimize the price volatility associated with these operational pipeline activities 
as a result of the tgp rate case filed with the ferc which proposes an increase in base tariff rates effective june   the percentage of our revenues derived from reservation charges may increase and therefore may reduce the impacts to our ebit due to excess fuel recoveries 

table of contents bankruptcy proceeds 
during  our revenue increased by million related to calpine corporation s calpine s rejection of its transportation contracts with us primarily associated with distributions received under calpine s approved plan of reorganization 
during  we recorded income of approximately million  net of amounts potentially owed to certain customers  related to amounts recovered from the enron bankruptcy settlement 
operating and general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   our operating and general and administrative expenses were lower than in primarily due to severance costs of approximately million recorded in additionally  when comparing the year ended december  to  our operating and general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by million of decreased field repair and maintenance expense on several of our pipeline systems 
asset write downs 
during  we incurred a million non cash asset write down based on a ferc order related to the sale of the natural buttes compressor station and gas processing plant in during  we recorded a gain of million related to the sale of these assets 
we recorded impairments of approximately million and million in and primarily related to our decision not to continue with a storage project due to market conditions 
during  we recorded impairments of million  including an impairment related to our essex middlesex lateral project due to a prolonged permitting process and an impairment of our epng arizona gas storage projects that we were no longer developing due to declining real estate values 
tgp entered into an agreement with an effective date of october to sell certain of their offshore pipeline assets and related facilities 
tgp has filed an abandonment application with the ferc related to the sale 
the sale is contingent upon receiving ferc approval of the abandonment application including the ability to recover in future rates the difference between the regulatory net book value and purchase price as well as the designation of certain facilities as non jurisdictional 
if approved  tgp expects to complete the sale of these assets by mid and may incur a loss on the sale for financial accounting purposes 
however  the outcome of the ferc s approval of the application is currently undeterminable 
as such  the assets are not considered as held for sale 
sale of mexican assets 
during  we recorded a gain of approximately million on the sale of our interests in certain mexican pipeline and compression assets 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased during and due to the issuance of additional public common units and the contribution of additional assets into the mlp 
in  our mlp has issued million additional public common units 
also  during  we contributed an additional percent interest in sng and a percent interest in slng and elba express to the mlp 
as of december   our ownership interest in the mlp is percent  including our two percent general partner interest 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes preferred returns on gip s interests in cheyenne plains and ruby 
for the year ended december   we recorded million associated with gip s preferred interests in cheyenne plains and ruby
