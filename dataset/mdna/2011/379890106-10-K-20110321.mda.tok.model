overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results for fiscal  as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
financial results and trends revenues for were million  a decrease from  in which we reported revenues of million 
this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in feature phones sold in the channel relating to our traditional carrier based business  which in turn led to a decrease in the number of games that we sold 
the decrease was partially related to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  which had a greater negative impact on our revenues for compared to the decline in our feature phone revenues was primarily due to the continued migration of users from traditional feature phones to smartphones  such as apple s iphone and mobile phones utilizing google s android operating system  which offer enhanced functionality 
we believe that this transition will continue to accelerate in and for the foreseeable future as consumers increasingly upgrade their phones 
in addition  we intend to release fewer games for feature phones in future periods  which will further reduce our revenues that we derive from feature phones 
because we still expect feature phone revenues to comprise the majority of our revenues for  we expect an overall decline in our revenues for compared with for us to succeed in and beyond  we believe that we must increasingly publish mobile games that are widely accepted and commercially successful on the smartphone and tablet digital storefronts  which include apple s app store  google s android market  microsoft s windows marketplace for mobile  palm s app catalog  nokia s ovi store and research in motion s blackberry app world 
although we have experienced certain successes on these digital storefronts  particularly with respect to the apple app store  our smartphone revenue only accounted for approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
our strategy for increasing our revenues from smartphones and tablets involves becoming the leading publisher of social  mobile freemium games games that are downloadable without an initial charge  but which enable a variety of additional features to be accessed for a fee or otherwise monetized through various advertising and offer techniques 
our social  freemium games are provided as a live service and are generally designed to be persistent through regular content updates 
we believe this approach will enable us to build and grow a longer lasting and more direct relationship with our customers  which will assist us in our future sales and marketing efforts 
we intend to have the substantial majority of our social  freemium games be based upon our own intellectual property  which we believe will significantly enhance our margins and long term value 

table of contents although we expect our revenues from smartphones and tablets to increase in as compared to  we do not expect this increase to fully offset the anticipated decline in revenues from games we develop for feature phones  and therefore in we expect that our total revenues will decline from our revenues 
however  we believe that our smartphone revenues will surpass our feature phone revenues on a monthly run rate basis by the end of and that this transition will position us to return to overall revenue growth in the longer term 
significantly growing our revenues from smartphones and tablets may be challenging for us for several reasons  including the open nature of many of the smartphone and tablet storefronts substantially increases the number of our competitors and competitive products  we have only recently concentrated our efforts on developing and marketing social  freemium games  our relatively limited experience with respect to creating games that include micro transaction capabilities  advertizing and offers may cause us to have difficulty optimizing the monetization of our freemium games  we historically have had limited success in generating significant revenues from games based on our own intellectual property rather than licensed brands  our social  freemium games may not be widely downloaded by consumers for a variety of reasons  including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity  ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts or a failure to achieve prominent storefront featuring for such games  and we have a limited ability to invest heavily in this strategy 
in addition  our revenues will continue to depend significantly on growth in the mobile games market  our ability to continue to attract new end users in that market and the overall strength of the economy  particularly in the united states 
our revenues may also be adversely impacted by decisions by our carriers to alter their customer terms for downloading our games 
for example  verizon wireless  our largest carrier  imposes a data surcharge to download content on those verizon customers who have not otherwise subscribed to a data plan 
our revenues depend on a variety of other factors  including our relationships with digital storefront owners and our licensors 
the loss of any key relationships with our digital storefront owners  carriers  other distributors or licensors could impact our revenues in the future 
our net loss in was million versus a net loss of million in this decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in costs of revenues of million due to a decrease in overall sales and impairments of advanced royalties  a decrease in operating expenses of million and a decrease in income tax provision of million  which was partially offset by a million reduction in revenues 
the decrease in our operating expenses for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was in part due to the headcount reductions and related measures that we took in connection with the restructurings that we implemented in both the third quarter of and the first  second and fourth quarters of our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of the currencies in which we incur meaningful operating expenses principally the british pound sterling  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble and our customers reporting currencies  as we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and these currencies fluctuated significantly in and we significantly increased our spending on sales and marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter of in connection with the launch of our initial social  freemium titles  and we expect our sales and marketing expenditures to increase slightly from this level during we also expect that our expenses to develop and port games for advanced platforms and smartphones will increase as we enhance our existing titles and develop new titles to take advantage of the additional functionality offered by these platforms  including through external development relationships 
as a result of this increased spending on sales and marketing and research and development initiatives  we expect to use a significant amount of cash in operations as we seek to grow our business 
our ability to attain profitability will be affected by our ability to grow our revenues and the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our recurring expenses is personnel costs  which consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for our employees 
we expect that the restructuring measures we implemented in the first  second and fourth quarters of  which primarily consisted of headcount reductions  will have a beneficial effect on our overall operating expenses  but will not fully offset the expected increases in our sales and marketing and research and development expenses in connection with our new social  freemium games  as discussed above 
our business has historically been impacted by seasonality  as many new mobile handset models are released in the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season 
because many end users download our games soon after they purchase new mobile 
table of contents phones and tablets  we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period 
however  due to the time between mobile phone and tablet purchases and game purchases  some of this holiday impact occurs for us in our first calendar quarter 
further  for a variety of reasons  including roaming charges for data downloads that may make purchase of our games prohibitively expensive for many end users while they are traveling  we sometimes experience seasonal sales decreases during the summer  particularly in parts of europe 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  an increase of million from the balance at december  this increase was primarily due to million of net proceeds received from the private placement of common stock that we completed in august the private placement  million of cash generated from operations and  of proceeds received from option exercises and purchases under our employees stock purchase program 
these inflows were partially offset by million paid during with respect to the promissory notes and bonuses that we issued to the mig shareholders that are discussed in further detail in significant transactions below 
we also repaid million under our credit facility and paid  for capital expenditures 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  does not include the million in net proceeds that we received from our underwritten public offering of common stock that we completed in january  as discussed in further detail in significant transactions below 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
significant transactions in january   we sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share for net proceeds of approximately million after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the underwriters of this offering were roth capital partners  llc  craig hallum capital group llc  merriman capital  inc and northland capital markets 
we intend to utilize a significant portion of the net proceeds from this offering to further the development of our global social gaming community  including with respect to our glu games network and glu partners initiatives 
on august   we completed the private placement in which we issued and sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share and warrants exercisable to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share for initial gross proceeds of approximately million excluding any proceeds we may receive upon exercise of the warrants 
in december  we renegotiated and extended our credit facility  and also amended the terms of the credit facility in august  february  march and february the credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base equal to of our eligible accounts receivable 
the most recent fourth amendment to the credit facility that we entered into in february waived our default in maintaining minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda specified in the loan agreement for the period beginning october  and ending december  this fourth amendment also removed the ebitda financial covenant from the loan agreement in its entirety and replaced this covenant with a net cash covenant  which requires us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash at the lender or an affiliate of the lender  net of any indebtedness that we owe to the lender under the loan agreement 
in march  we acquired superscape  a global publisher of mobile games  to deepen and broaden our game library  gain access to d game development resources and to augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in moscow  russia 
we paid pence pound sterling in cash for each issued share of superscape for a total purchase price of million  consisting of cash consideration of million and transaction costs of million 
due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization the entire goodwill resulting from the superscape acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  in december  we acquired mig to accelerate our presence in china  deepen our relationship with china mobile  the largest wireless carrier in china  acquire access and rights to leading franchises for the chinese market  and augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in china 
as a result of the attainment of revenue and operating income milestones in by mig  we were committed to pay million in additional 
table of contents consideration to the mig shareholders and million of bonuses to two officers of mig 
in december  we restructured the timing and nature of these payments and issued to former shareholders of mig an aggregate of million in promissory notes  which were due in and  we have repaid the last of the installments on these promissory notes in the fourth quarter of due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization  a portion of the goodwill resulting from the mig acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time these estimates and judgments are made  actual results may differ from those estimates  which could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and they require critical management estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments  business combinations purchase accounting  long lived assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we generate revenues through the sale of our games on traditional feature phones and smartphones  such as apple s iphone and mobile phones utilizing google s android operating system  that offer enhanced functionality 
feature phone games are distributed primarily through wireless carriers and we recognize revenues in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition 
smartphone games are distributed primarily through digital storefronts such as the apple app store and we recognize revenues related to in app purchases or micro transactions in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as revised by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we estimate revenues from carriers in the current period when reasonable estimates of these amounts can be made 
several carriers provide reliable interim preliminary reporting and others report sales data within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  both of which allow us to make reasonable estimates of revenues and therefore to recognize revenues during the reporting period when the end user licenses the game 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
our estimates for revenues include consideration of factors such as preliminary sales data  carrier specific historical sales trends  the age of games and the expected impact of newly launched games  successful introduction of new handsets  promotions during the period and economic trends 
when we receive the final carrier reports  to the extent not received within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  we record any differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues in the reporting period when we determine the actual amounts 
historically  the revenues on the final revenue report have not differed by more than one half of of the reported revenues for the period  which we deemed to be immaterial 
revenues earned from certain carriers may not be reasonably estimated 
if we are unable 
table of contents to reasonably estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period  we recognize revenues upon the receipt of a carrier revenue report and when our portion of a game s licensed revenues is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
to monitor the reliability of our estimates  our management  where possible  reviews the revenues by carrier and by game on a weekly basis to identify unusual trends such as differential adoption rates by carriers or the introduction of new handsets 
if we deem a carrier not to be creditworthy  we defer all revenues from the arrangement with that carrier until we receive payment and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations  we recognize as revenues the amount the carrier reports as payable upon the sale of our games 
we have evaluated our carrier and digital storefront agreements and have determined that we are not the principal when selling our games 
key indicators that we evaluated to reach this determination include wireless subscribers directly contract with the carriers and digital storefronts  which have most of the service interaction and are generally viewed as the primary obligor by the subscribers  carriers and digital storefronts generally have significant control over the types of games that they offer to their subscribers  carriers and digital storefronts are directly responsible for billing and collecting fees from their subscribers  including the resolution of billing disputes  carriers and digital storefronts generally pay us a fixed percentage of their revenues or a fixed fee for each game  carriers and digital storefronts generally must approve the price of our games in advance of their sale to subscribers or provide tiered pricing thresholds  and the more significant carriers generally have the ability to set the ultimate price charged to their subscribers  and we have limited risks  including no inventory risk and limited credit risk 
we derive a portion of our revenues through the sale of virtual items and currency on certain games downloaded for free freemium games through digital storefronts 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of these virtual items  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied requires judgments that may have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
for example  on the date that we sell certain premium games and virtual items and currency through micro transactions within our freemium games  we have an obligation to provide additional services and incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee 
in these cases  we account for the sale of the software product as a multiple element arrangement and recognize the revenue over the estimated life of the game or virtual item  with the exception of certain consumable virtual items which are items consumed at a predetermined time or otherwise have limitations on repeated use  these are recognized upon full consumption of the virtual item 
all other durable virtual items which are not consumed at a predetermined time or otherwise do not have a limitation on repeated use  we recognize over the estimated life of the virtual item 
for these virtual items we have considered the average period that game players typically play our games to arrive at our best estimates for the useful life 
while we believe our estimates to be reasonable based on available game player information  we may revise such estimates in the future as our games operation periods change 
any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual items would be applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns 
any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual items may result in our revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods and may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of sales to end users 
in accordance with the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees  we recorded a minimum guaranteed liability of approximately  as of december  when no significant 
table of contents performance remains with the licensor  we initially record each of these guarantees as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount 
we believe that the contractual amount represents the fair value of our liability 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than upon execution of the contract 
we classify minimum royalty payment obligations as current liabilities to the extent they are contractually due within the next twelve months 
each quarter  we also evaluate the realization of our royalties as well as any unrecognized guarantees not yet paid to determine amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
we use estimates of revenues  cash flows and net margins to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
this evaluation considers multiple factors  including the term of the agreement  forecasted demand  game life cycle status  game development plans and current and anticipated sales levels 
to the extent that this evaluation indicates that the remaining prepaid and guaranteed royalty payments are not recoverable  we record an impairment charge in the period such impairment is indicated 
subsequently  if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  amounts of prepaid royalties previously written down may be utilized  resulting in lower cost of revenues and higher income from operations than previously expected in that period 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of  million and million  respectively 
business combinations purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to january   we utilized the purchase method of accounting  which required that we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
see goodwill below 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update regarding business combinations  asc  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
asc also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  although we did not enter into any business combinations during or  we believe asc may have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements if we were to enter into any future business combinations depending on the size and nature of any such future transactions 
long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  property plant equipment asc 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices  if applicable  or a discounted cash flow analysis 

table of contents goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives but rather test them for impairment 
asc requires us to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance at least annually  which we do as of september each year  and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in our impairment reviews  we look at the goodwill allocated to our reporting units the americas  emea and asia pacific apac 
asc requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the first step measures for impairment by applying the fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying the fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  and or the income approach  which uses discounted cash flows 
we have three geographic segments comprised of the americas  apac and emea regions 
as of december   we only had goodwill attributable to the apac reporting unit 
we performed an annual impairment review as of september  as prescribed in asc and concluded that we were not at risk of failing the first step  as the fair value of the apac reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary 
as a result  we were not required to perform the second step 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  we utilized the discounted cash flow and market methods 
we have consistently utilized both methods in our goodwill impairment tests and weight both results equally and we believe both  in conjunction with each other  provide a reasonable estimate of the determination of fair value of the reporting unit the discounted cash flow method being specific to anticipated future results of the reporting unit and the market method  which is based on our market sector including our competitors 
the assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow method  were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
in  we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment of million as the fair values of the americas  apac and emea reporting units were determined to be below their respective carrying values 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  the assigning of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the assigning of goodwill to reporting units and the determining of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments and assumptions include the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including forecasted revenues and costs based on current titles under contract  forecasted new titles that we expect to release  timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and growth rates in terminal values 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the use of the market comparable approach requires judgments regarding the comparability of companies with lines of business similar to ours 
this process is particularly difficult in a situation where no domestic public mobile games companies exist 
the factors used in the selection of comparable companies include growth characteristics as measured by revenue or other financial metrics  margin characteristics  product defined markets served  customer defined markets served  the size of a company as measured by financial metrics such as revenue or market capitalization  the competitive position of a company  such as whether it is a market leader in terms of indicators like market share  and company specific issues that suggest appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular company as a comparable 
further  the total gross value calculated under each method was not materially different  and therefore if the weighting were different we do not believe that this would have significantly impacted our conclusion 
if different comparable companies had been used  the market multiples and resulting estimates of the fair value of our stock would also have been different 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  which could trigger impairment 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
asc requires the recognition of compensation expense using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
to value awards granted on or after january   we used the black scholes option pricing model  which requires  among other inputs  an estimate of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and assumptions as to volatility of our stock over the term of the related options  the expected term of the options  the risk free interest rate and the option forfeiture rate 
we determined the assumptions used in this pricing model at each grant date 
we concluded that it was not practicable to calculate the volatility of our share price since our securities have been publicly traded for a limited period of time 
therefore  we based expected volatility on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities and our own historic volatility 
we determined the expected term of our options based upon historical exercises  post vesting cancellations and the options contractual term 
we based the risk free rate for the expected term of the option on the us treasury constant maturity rate as of the grant date 
we determined the forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience with option cancellations adjusted for unusual or infrequent events 
in  and  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  asc requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated by management  we may be required to record adjustments to stock based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax benefit provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current income tax benefit provision together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  we would need to make an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset  which would increase income in the period that determination was made 
we account for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with asc  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
we have not provided federal income taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  other than china  because these earnings are intended to be reinvested permanently 

table of contents results of operations the following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in our statements of operations for the comparison periods identified 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands feature phone smartphone revenues our revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was due to a million decline in feature phone revenue which was partially offset by a million increase in smartphone revenue 
the decrease in feature phone revenues was primarily due to the continued migration of users from feature phones to smartphones where we were unable to capture the same market share as we have in our traditional carrier business 
foreign currency exchange rates also had a greater positive impact on our revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the diversification of our product portfolio  including the titles resulting from the acquisitions of mig and superscape  no single title represented or more of sales in either or international revenues decreased by million  from million in to million in this was primarily related to a million  or  decrease in our emea revenues  a million  or  decrease in our china revenues and an  or  decrease in our americas revenues  excluding us revenues 
the decline in our emea and americas revenues  excluding us revenues  was primarily due to declining sales in our feature phone business 
the decline in our china revenues was primarily due to  of one time revenues recorded from an apac customer in the first quarter of and a decrease in the revenue share we receive through our revenue share arrangements with china mobile that became effective in february although we expect our revenues from smartphones and tablets to increase in as compared to  we do not expect this increase to fully offset the anticipated decline in revenues from games we develop for feature phones  and therefore we expect that our total revenues will decline in as compared with however  we believe that our smartphone revenues will surpass our feature phone revenues on a monthly run rate basis by the end of and that this transition will position us to return to overall revenue growth in the longer term 
cost of revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of revenues royalties impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues revenues gross margin our cost of revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in impairments of prepaid royalties and guarantees due 
table of contents to fewer new licenses and full impairment of existing titles  a decrease of million in royalties associated with a decline in revenue and a million reduction in amortization for titles and content due primarily to certain intangible assets relating to mig  macrospace and superscape being fully amortized in the first and fourth quarters of revenues attributable to games based upon branded intellectual property increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in  primarily due to a decrease in sales of games developed by mig and superscape based on their original intellectual property 
revenues attributable to games based upon original intellectual property were of our total revenues for  of which nearly one third related to mig 
we expect this percentage to increase significantly in in connection with our strategy to develop the substantial majority of our new social  freemium games based on our own intellectual property 
the average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed intellectual property  excluding royalty impairments  decreased from in to in due to decreased sales of titles with higher royalty rates 
overall royalties  including impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees  as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage of revenues our research and development expenses decreased  or  from million in to million in the decrease in research and development costs was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of  a  decrease in outside services costs due to a reduction in third party costs for porting and external development and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of  which was partially offset by an increase in allocated facilities and overhead costs of  we decreased our research and development staff from employees in to in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased from in to in research and development expenses included  of stock based compensation expense in and  in we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in due to our expected release of to new social  freemium titles in  approximately half of which will be developed by external developers as part of our glu partners program and which will require significant upfront cash payment to such developers 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percentage of revenues our sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in salaries  benefits  variable compensation and expatriate costs as we reduced our sales and marketing headcount from in to in  this was partially the result of converting our latin america sales and marketing team from our employees to employees of a third party distribution agent 
we also had an  decrease in the mig earnout expense due to lower amortization of stock based compensation expense associated with reaching the end of the vesting terms and conditions in  a  decrease in travel and entertainment expense and a  decrease in stock based compensation expense due to reduced headcount 
this was partially offset by a  increase in consulting fees associated with converting our latin america sales and marketing to third party distribution agents as discussed above and a  increase in marketing promotions associated with the launch of our new social  freemium game titles during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in sales and marketing expenses included  of stock based

other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  increased from a net expense of million during to a net expense of million in this change was primarily due to a  increase in foreign currency losses related to the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities including accounts payable and accounts receivable which was partially offset by a  decrease in interest expense related to the lower balances outstanding on the mig notes and borrowings under our credit facility 
income tax benefit provision income tax provision decreased from million in to  in as a result of taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions  changes in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes resulting from increased sales in countries with withholding tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to the effect of our non us operations  non deductible stock based compensation expense  an increase in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes 
our effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the higher effective benefit tax rate in was mainly attributable to a decrease in pre tax losses and changes in withholding taxes  dividends and non deductible stock based compensation 
our effective income tax rates for and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as changes in our business such as from intercompany transactions and any acquisitions  any changes in our international structure  any changes in the geographic location of our business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of our income  any changes in or termination of

we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
one of our subsidiaries in china has received approval as a high new technology enterprise qualification from the ministry of science and technology  and also a software enterprise qualification from the ministry of industry and information technology

however  in the event that circumstances change and we no longer meet the requirements of our original qualification  we would need to revalue certain tax assets and liabilities 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands feature phone smartphone revenues our revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was due to a million decline in feature phone revenue which was partially offset by a million increase in smartphone revenue 
the decrease in feature phone revenue was primarily due to the continued migration of users from feature phones to smartphones where we were unable to capture the same market share as we have in our traditional carrier business 
foreign currency exchange rates also had a greater positive impact on our revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the diversification of our product portfolio  including the titles resulting from the acquisitions of mig and superscape  no single title represented or more of sales in either or international revenues decreased by million  from million in to million in the decrease in international revenues was primarily a result of decreased unit sales in emea and china  which was partially offset by increased unit sales in latin america

these inflows were partially offset by the million that we paid during with respect to the promissory notes and bonuses that we issued to the mig shareholders and million that we paid down under our credit facility

sufficiency of current cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  this amount does not include the million in net proceeds that we received from our underwritten public offering of common stock that we completed in january we expect to fund our operations and satisfy our contractual obligations for primarily through our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
however  as a result of our plans to increase our spending on sales and marketing and research and development initiatives in connection with our new social  freemium games that we will release in  we expect to use a significant amount of cash in our operations during as we seek to grow our business 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  together with borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  our cash requirements for the next months may be greater than we anticipate due to  among other reasons  the impact of foreign currency rate changes  revenues that are lower than we currently anticipate  greater than expected operating expenses  particularly with respect to our research and development and sales and marketing initiatives  usage of cash to fund our foreign operations  unanticipated limitations or timing restrictions on our ability to access funds that are held in our non us subsidiaries 
we currently have an million credit facility  which expires on june  we do not intend to extend the maturity date of this credit facility  and may seek to enter into a new credit facility with the lender or a new lender 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into a new facility on terms favorable to us or at all 
our credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to draw down the entire million 
these covenants are as follows ebitda and net cash 
on august   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility  which reduced certain of the minimum targets contained in the credit facility s ebitda related covenant 
on february  we entered into a second amendment to the agreement 
the second amendment changed the measurement period for the ebitda covenant from a rolling six month calculation to a quarterly calculation 
on march   we entered into a third amendment to the agreement which extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  until june   increased the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility by to the lender s prime rate  plus  but no less than  and requires us to maintain  measured on a consolidated basis at the end of each periods a minimum amount of ebitda 
on february   we entered into 
table of contents a fourth amendment to our credit facility which waived our default in maintaining minimum levels of ebitda specified in the loan agreement for the period beginning october  and ending december  the fourth amendment also removed the ebitda financial covenant from the loan agreement in its entirety and replaced this covenant with a net cash covenant  which requires us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash at the lender or an affiliate of the lender  net of any indebtedness that we owe to the lender under the loan agreement 
minimum domestic liquidity we must maintain at the lender an amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of not less than the greater of a of our total consolidated unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or b of outstanding obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility also includes a material adverse change clause 
as a result  if a material adverse change occurs with respect to our business  operations or financial condition  then that change could constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit facility 
when an event of default occurs  the lender can  among other things  declare all obligations immediately due and payable  could stop advancing money or extending credit under the credit facility and could terminate the credit facility 
we believe that the risk of a material adverse change occurring with respect to our business  operations or financial condition and the lender requesting immediate repayment of amounts already borrowed  stopping advancing the remaining credit or terminating the credit facility is remote 
our credit facility is collateralized by eligible customer accounts receivable balances  as defined by the lender 
there can be no assurances that our eligible accounts receivable balances will be adequate to allow us to draw down on the entire million credit facility particularly if any of our larger customers creditworthiness deteriorates 
at our current revenue levels  we are not able to access the full million of the credit facility 
in addition  among other things  the credit facility limits our ability to dispose of certain assets  make acquisitions  incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends and make other distributions  and make investments 
further  the credit facility requires us to maintain a separate account with the lender for collection of our accounts receivables 
all deposits into this account will be automatically applied by the lender to our outstanding obligations under the credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our credit facility  which is classified as a current liability on the december  balance sheet 
our failure to comply with the cash covenants in the credit facility would not only prohibit us from borrowing under the facility  but would also constitute a default  permitting the lender to  among other things  declare any outstanding borrowings  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  immediately due and payable 
a change in control of glu also constitutes an event of default  permitting the lender to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
the credit facility also contains other customary events of default 
utilizing our credit facility results in debt payments that bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus  but no less than  which adversely impacts our cash position and result in cash covenants that restrict our operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our debt 
the credit facility matures on june   when all amounts outstanding will be due 
if the credit facility is terminated prior to maturity by us or by the lender after the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  then we will owe a termination fee equal to  or of the total commitment 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the ebitda covenant  but the lender subsequently waived such non compliance in connection with our entry into the fourth amendment to the credit facility as described above 
of the million of cash and cash equivalents that we held at december   approximately million were held in accounts in china 
to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations  we repatriated approximately million of available funds from china to the united states during  and we repatriated an additional million of available funds from china to the united states in august both of these amounts were subject to withholding taxes of 
we do not anticipate repatriating any additional funds from china for the foreseeable future  as changes in our revenue share arrangement with china mobile has significantly impacted our ability to generate meaningful cash from our china operations 
in addition  given the current global economic environment and other potential developments outside of our control  we may be unable to utilize the funds that we hold in all of our non us accounts  which funds include cash and marketable securities  since the funds may be frozen by additional international regulatory actions  the accounts may become illiquid for an indeterminate period of time or there may be other such circumstances that we are unable to predict 

table of contents in addition  we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our cash sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to raise additional capital by selling convertible debt  preferred stock convertible into common stock or unconvertible or common stock  potentially pursuant to our effective universal shelf registration statement  seeking to increase the amount available to us for borrowing under our credit facility  procuring a new debt facility and or selling some of our assets 
we may be unable to raise additional capital through the sale of securities  or to do so on terms that are favorable to us  particularly given current capital market and overall economic conditions 
any sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders as was the case with the private placement and our recent underwritten public offering 
the holders of new securities may also receive rights  preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock  all of which is subject to the provisions of the credit facility 
additionally  we may be unable to increase the size of our credit facility or procure a new debt facility  or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of the current credit market conditions 
if the amount of cash that we require is greater than we anticipate  we could also be required to extend the term of our credit facility beyond its june  expiration date or replace it with an alternate loan arrangement  and resulting debt payments thereunder could further inhibit our ability to achieve profitability in the future 
contractual obligations the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations  net of sublease income guaranteed royalties line of credit we have entered into license and development arrangements with various owners of brands and other intellectual property so that we can create and publish games for mobile handsets based on that intellectual property 
a significant portion of these agreements require us to pay guaranteed royalties over the term of the contracts regardless of actual game sales 
in march  we signed a third amendment to the credit facility which extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  until june   when all amounts outstanding will be due 
as of december   the above amount had been classified within current liabilities 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties of million which were classified within other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement of our income tax liabilities could not be determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due during additionally in january  we paid  of taxes that had been withheld on the december  payment that we made to the former mig shareholders in china

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised 
table of contents guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement  which amended the consolidation guidance that applies to variable interest entities vie under asc  consolidation asc 
the new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we adopted this guidance on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our interest payable under our million credit facility and potential increases in our interest payments arising from increases in interest rates and our investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest payments under our million credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to our credit facility lender s prime rate  plus  but no less than 
consequently  our interest expense will fluctuate with changes in the general level of interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and our effective interest rate at that time was approximately 
we believe that a change in the lender s prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense  results of operations and liquidity 
we are also potentially exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest earned on our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no short term investments and substantially all million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating bank accounts earning nominal interest 
accordingly  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity related to these amounts 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states  the united kingdom  australia  brazil  china  colombia  france  germany  hong kong  italy  russia and spain and our current deposits are likely in excess of insured limits 
our accounts receivable primarily relate to revenues earned from domestic and international wireless carriers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our carriers financial condition but generally require no collateral from them 
at december   verizon wireless accounted for and telecomunicaciones movilnet accounted for of total accounts receivable 
at december   verizon wireless accounted for of total accounts receivable 
no other carrier represented more than of our total accounts receivable as of these dates 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and in and  some of these currencies fluctuated by up to 
our revenues are usually denominated in the functional currency of the carrier while the operating expenses of our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency  with the significant operating currencies consisting of british pound sterling gbp  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble 
although recording operating expenses in the local currency of our 
table of contents foreign operations mitigates some of the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations  variances among the currencies of our customers and our foreign operations relative to the united states dollar usd could have and have had a material impact on our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations in gbp versus the usd and in the euro versus gbp 
at month end  foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income expense  net 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  in which our chinese operations principally transact business  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit our ability to react to foreign currency devaluations 
to date  we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
