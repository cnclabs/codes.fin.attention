item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  dated march  is intended to assist in understanding and assessing our results of operations and financial condition 
gold reserve  an exploration stage company  is engaged in the business of acquiring  exploring and developing mining projects 
from to we focused substantially all of our management and financial resources on the development of the brisas gold and copper project located in the kilometre mining district of the state of bolivar in south eastern venezuela which we refer to as the brisas project or brisas 
since  expenditures associated with the brisas project and choco property both capitalized and expensed as a period cost total nearly million 
see item properties 
the company s current financial position and historical results of operations are a product of the company s efforts  since  to develop the brisas project into an operating mine and more specifically  a function of our decision  subsequent to the issuance of the authorization to affect  to place orders to acquire approximately million of equipment  raise million through the issuance of convertible notes and common shares and to continue to incur substantial operating deficits 
likewise  our october request for arbitration under the additional facility rules of icsid and the write off of the costs associated with our venezuelan operations will continue to influence the future financial position and results of operations of the company 
we expect the arbitration process  which commenced in april when we advised venezuela of our claims pursuant to the canada venezuela tr eaty  to last three to five years from commencement and consume substantial management time and financial resources 
in continuance of our efforts  our primary objectives are to manage the arbitration claim against venezuela including  to the extent possible  accelerating its completion and to minimize costs 
our other major objectives for are to continue to pursue an amicable settlement with venezuela that may include a monetary agreement and or project participation  dispose of previously purchased brisas project assets  which originally cost approximately million and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated net realizable value of million  pursue alternative industry opportunities for participation  and continue to evaluate the company s options to redeem  restructure or otherwise modify the terms of the convertible notes which  among other things  are subject to the sale of the brisas project assets 
we believe the successful execution of these objectives will be facilitated by the company s senior management team  which has extensive technical  financial and administrative experience in the mining industry substantially all of whom have been employed by the company for over years with a single focus of developing the brisas project 
these individuals not only possess valuable historical knowledge related to the brisas project which is important to the successful execution of our arbitration efforts but they also play a critical role in the company s ongoing evaluation and monitoring of mining opportunities for potential participation by the company 
the timing of any such new investment or transaction if any  and the amounts that may be required cannot be determined at this time and are subject to available cash  sale of equipment originally slated for the brisas project and or future financings  if any 
on october   in apparent response to our filing on october   a request for arbitration under the additional facility rules of icsid against venezuela  government personnel arrived at the project site  claimed ownership of the brisas alluvial concession  seized assets  expelled our personnel  and took physical possession of the property 
subsequently  on november   venezuela notified us through the issuance of an administrative act  dated october   of its intent to cancel our underlying hard rock concession which it formally completed in june we recorded a non cash expense adjustment of approximately of million related to the capital costs associated with the brisas project for the year ended december  see item legal proceedings arbitration 
in october  the company attended a meeting with representatives from the venezuelan attorney general s office and mibam to discuss our dispute and possible resolutions 
as a result of the meeting we have had formal and informal communications and expect to meet with these representatives in the near future to continue our discussions 
in december  venezuela filed a request with the tribunal for the production of documents over and above the volumes of hard copy exhibits and thousands of pages of electronic appendices which accompanied the company s september  memorial and also filed a jurisdictional objection claiming that gold reserve did not have the right to present a claim under the canada venezuela treaty 
venezuela further requested a suspension of the proceedings on the merits so that the jurisdictional objections could be treated as a preliminary matter separate from the merits 
on february   the tribunal issued a procedural order granting in part venezuela s request for the production of certain documents 
to the extent the documents ordered to be produced were deemed to be proprietary by the company  the tribunal s order granted view only access to such documents 
in addition to the production of documents  the tribunal in its order established a revised schedule for the remaining written submissions including granting venezuela a five week extension from march  to april  to file its response or counter memorial to the company s memorial 
the oral hearing date of february  remains unchanged 
on february   the tribunal denied venezuela s previous petition to bifurcate the arbitration into a jurisdiction phase and a merits phase and decided that venezuela s jurisdictional objections will be addressed together with the merits 
see item legal proceedings arbitration we have no commercial production at this time and  as a result  we have not recorded revenue or cash flows from mining operations and continue to experience losses from operations  a trend we expect to continue unless and until the investment dispute regarding brisas is resolved favorably to the company and or we acquire or invest in an alternative project 
historically we have financed the company s operations through the issuance of common stock  other equity securities and convertible debt 
the company has only one operating segment  the exploration and development of mineral properties 
segmented financial in formation by geographic region is shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the expense categories shown in the consolidated statements of operations were reclassified in to better present the current operations of the company 
as a result  expenses for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to be comparative with the december  presentation 
these reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations

critical accounting estimates we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
management considers the sum of the expected future net cash flows to be generated from the use or disposition of a long lived asset undiscounted and without interest charges and compares that to its carrying value and if such expected future net cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to fair value 
fair value is generally determined by discounting estimated cash flows  using quoted market prices where available or making estimates based on the best information available 
in  subsequent to the loss of control and physical access to the brisas project  we recorded a non cash adjustment of approximately million related to the carrying value of brisas project assets including an adjustment of approximately million for the estimated net realizable value of certain processing and related equipment 
in we recorded an additional million write down of some of this processing and related equipment to estimated net realizable value 
management makes no assurances that the estimated net realizable value of the remaining processing and related equipment can be disposed of for its recorded estimated value 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the debt component of the company s convertible notes is accreted to the face value of the notes using the effective interest rate method over the expected life of the notes  with the resulting charge recorded as interest expense 
the expected life of the notes is an estimate and is subject to change  if warranted by facts and circumstances related to the potential early redemption of the notes by either the company or the holders 
at december   we revised our estimate of the expected life of the notes to june  and adjusted the carrying value accordingly 
see consolidated balance sheets convertible notes and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adjusted carrying value was calculated by computing the present value of estimated future interest and principal payments at the original effective interest rate 
as a result of this change  the carrying value of the notes increased by approximately million with a corresponding increase in capitalized interest and accretion 
the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
future tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and those amounts reported in the financial statements 
the future tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the differences are expected to be settled 
future tax assets are recognized to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be realized 
we operate and file tax returns in a number of jurisdictions 
the preparation of such tax filings requires considerable judgment and the use of assumptions 
accordingly  the amounts reported could vary in the future 
see consolidated statements of operations income tax expense 
the company uses the fair value method of accounting for stock options 
the fair value is computed using the black scholes method which utilizes estimates that affect the amounts ultimately recorded as stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the more significant accounting policies are as follows financial instruments 
the company provides disclosures in its financial statements that enable users to evaluate a the significance of financial instruments for the company financial position and performance  and b the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the company is exposed during the period and at the balance sheet date  and how the company manages those risks 
stock based compensation 
we use the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors 
consideration paid for shares on exercise of share options in addition to the fair value attributable to stock options granted is credited to capital stock 
exploration and development costs 
exploration costs incurred in locating areas of potential mineralization are expensed as incurred 
exploration costs of properties or working interests with specific areas of potential mineralization are capitalized at cost pending the determination of a property s economic viability 
development costs of proven mining properties not yet producing are capitalized at cost and classified as capitalized exploration costs under property  plant and equipment 
costs related to staffing and maintenance of offices and facilities in venezuela are charged to operations 
property holding costs are charged to operations during the period if no significant exploration or development activities are being conducted on the related properties 
upon commencement of production  capitalized exploration and development c osts would be amortized based on the estimated proven and probable reserves benefited 
properties determined to be impaired or that are abandoned are written down to the estimated fair value 
carrying values do not necessarily reflect present or future values 
measurement uncertainty 
any operations we may have are subject to the effects of changes in legal  tax and regulatory regimes  political  labor and economic developments  social and political unrest  currency and exchange controls  import export restrictions and government bureaucracy in the countries in which we operate 
the realizable value of the remaining processing and related equipment recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be different than management s current estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company operates and files tax returns in a number of jurisdictions 
the preparation of such tax filings requires considerable judgment and the use of assumptions 
accordingly  the amounts reported could vary in the future 
internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
we believe that internal controls over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated  can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are met 
there have been no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the twelve months ended december  that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  the company s internal control over financial reporting 
liquidity and capital resources at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million which represents a net reduction over the prior period of approximately million 
the net reduction in cash and cash equivalents was primarily comprised of cash used by operations of million offset by cash provided by investing activities of million 
the components of changes in cash are more fully described in the operating  investing and financing activities section below 
change cash and cash equivalents    total financial resources  which includes cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash  marketable securities and assets held for sale which were liquidated in the first quarter of  totaled approximately million at december  as of march  we held approximately million in cash and investments 
the company s cash and investments are held primarily is us dollar denominated accounts 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents and investments  the company holds approximately million of equipment that it intends to dispose of in the primary future obligation of the company is the million convertible notes which may be settled in cash or common shares in the event the holder chooses the onetime option to put the notes back to the company for repurchase on june  see note to the consolidated financial statements and contractual obligations below 
with the ability to settle any call for redemption of the convertible notes with common shares  we believe that cash and investment balances and funds available from potential future equipment sales will be sufficient to enable us to fund our activities through the timing and extent of additional funding  if any  depends on a number of important factors  including  but not limited to the timing and outcome of our investment dispute with venezuela  the timing and the amount of proceeds  if any  from the sale of brisas project assets  the extent of future acquisitions or investments  if any  status of the financial markets and our share price 
operating activities cash flow used by operating activities for was approximately million  which consists of a net operating loss of approximately million adjusted for certain non cash income and expense items primarily related to the write down of brisas project assets  accretion of convertible notes and shares issued for compensation and certain non cash changes in working capital 
cash flow used by operating activities for represented an increase over the prior comparable period of approximately million which is primarily attributable to the increase in costs associated with arbitration and equipment storage  maintenance and insurance equipment holding costs 
although management was successful in reducing certain operating expenses as more fully discussed below in results of operations  non core expenses increased as a result of our arbitration efforts  equipment holding costs and the recognit ion of interest expense in the statement of operations which was previously capitalized 
investing activities in net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million an increase of million compared to during which million of net cash was used in investing activities 
change change net proceeds purchases of marketable securities     purchase of property  plant and equipment     proceeds from sale of equipment    decrease in restricted cash    capitalized interest on convertible debt   other      in  net proceeds from marketable securities totaled approximately million compared to net purchases of million in and net proceeds of million in the change in marketable securities primarily relates to debt securities which were purchased in and matured in investments in property  plant and equipment mainly relate to contractual purchases of equipment entered in and paid when the equipment was manufactured and delivered to the company 
equipment purchases in  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
since the revocation of the authorization to affect  the company has sold certain equipment originally costing approximately million 
in the company collected proceeds from the disposal of this equipment totaling approximately million 
over all  the company has recovered approximately million of progress payments and the purchaser assumed the company remaining payment obligations of approximately million 
as of december   the company s equipment purchase commitments were substantially complete and it held approximately million of equipment intended for sale 
in connection with a portion of the equipment commitments  we opened an irrevocable standby letter of credit  secured by cash  with a canadian chartered bank providing security on the performance of certain of our purchase obligations 
during  the company made its final payments on the commitments covered under the letter of credit and accordingly  as of december  the company had no restricted cash 
prior to october  we capitalized interest expense related to our convertible notes 
after venezuela seized physical control of the brisas project in october  we expensed interest charges related to the convertible notes 
included in interest expense are amounts related to the accretion of the notes to their face value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities the company had no significant financing activities in net proceeds from the issuance of commons shares have been limited over the last three years and mainly relates to the exercise of employee stock options 
the repurchase of convertible notes relates to the open market purchase of approximately million face value of convertible notes for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and contractual obligations below 
change change net proceeds from issuance of common shares    repurchase of convertible notes    contractual obligations the following table sets forth information on the company s material contractual obligation payments for the periods indicated as of december  payments due by period total less than year years more than years convertible notes    equipment contracts   total    in may  the company issued  aggregate principal amount of its convertible notes 
the notes pay interest semi annually and are due on june  although the convertible notes have a face value of million  they are recorded on the balance sheet at approximately million as canadian accounting standards require the company to allocate the proceeds from the notes between their equity and debt components based on their respective fair values at the time of issuance 
subject to certain conditions  the notes may be converted into class a common shares of the company  redeemed or repurchased 
the note holders have the option to require the company to repurchase the notes on june   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the company may elect to satisfy its obligation to pay the repurchase price  in whole or in part  by delivering common shares 
if in the future we elect to repurchase the notes with common shares  we would be required to issue shares based on the share price on june  at any time on or after june   and until june   the company may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest if the closing sale price of the common shares is equal to or greater than of the conversion price then in effect and the closing price for the company s common shares has remained above that price for at least trading days in the period of trading days preceding the company s notice of redemption 
beginning on june   the company may  at its option  redeem all or part of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the convertible notes are trading in the gray market often at a significant discount to face value 
as the terms of the indenture provide that the company may repurchase the convertible notes in open market purchases or negotiated transactions 
as of december    face value of convertible notes have been settled in cash or repurchased by the company at a total cost of  the amounts shown above include the interest and principal payments due based on the estimate that the term of the notes will end on june  if the notes were to reach their contractual maturity date of june   additional interest payments would amount to million over the additional ten year term of the notes 
the covenants contained in the convertible note indenture are limited to administrative issues such as payments of interest  maintenance of office or agency location  delivery of reports and other related issues 
likewise  events of default are defined as failure to pay interest and principal amounts when due  default in the performance of covenants  failure to convert notes upon holder s exercise of conversion rights and similar provisions or the company s failure to give notice of a fundamental change which is generally defined as events related to a change of control in the company 
in the event of a change of control of the company  the company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued but unpaid interest with cash or common shares unless there has occurred and is continuing certain events of default under the company s indenture 
remaining balance due on equipment purchase contracts entered during off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations summary results of operations consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million or per share compared to a net loss for the year ended december  of million or per share  a decrease of approximately million 
subsequent to the seizure of the brisas project in october by venezuela  we recorded a million non cash expense adjustment related to the carrying value of the project assets and the value of certain processing and related equipment 
change change other income     total expenses    net loss     excluding the extraordinary loss on expropriation of assets of million  the net loss increased from to approximately million 
core operating expenses corporate g a  venezuela expenses  corporate communications and legal and accounting declined by nearly or million during this period but were offset by increases in costs associated with arbitration  equipment holding costs and interest expense which was previously capitalized 
consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million or per share  an increase of approximately million from in addition to the million adjustment for the impairment of the assets associated with the brisas project  the change in net loss was due to decreases in other expenses of million and an increase in other income of million 
other income we have no commercial production at this time and as a result  other income is often variable from period to period due to one time or otherwise variable sources of income such as gains on disposition of marketable securities  extinguishment of debt and sale of equipment 
in  the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to reductions in gains on sales of marketable securities of million 
in addition  gains on extinguishment of debt decreased million due to the absence of any re purchases of the company s convertible notes 
these reductions in other income were partially offset by a million gain on the disposition of equity interests in two previously consolidated subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the increase in other income was due to a million increase of gains on disposition of marketable securities and a million increase in gains on the extinguishment of debt as a result of the re purchase of approximately million face value of the company s convertible notes at a substantial discount 
these increases were offset by a decrease in interest income primarily due to substantially reduced rates of return on invested cash and to a lesser extent  lower levels of invested cash 
change change interest      gain loss on disposition of marketable securities      gain on sale of subsidiaries   gain on extinguishment of debt     expenses overall the changes in expenditures are a function of the company s efforts to reduce principal operating expenses which are masked by ongoing costs associated with our arbitration claim against the republic of venezuela  equipment storage costs  takeover defense costs associated with the rusoro hostile takeover bid and interest expense on the convertible debt  which as a result of the seizure of the brisas project is no longer capitalized as a cost of the project 
during and  core operating costs decreased from the prior years by million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of reductions related to both the number of personnel and compensation related items  fees associated with consultants and other discretionary costs 
excluding the extraordinary loss  costs associated with equipment holding costs  further write down of brisas project related assets  net equipment sales  arbitration  takeover defense and interest on the convertible notes that is no longer capitalized  increased during and by million and million  respectively

equipment write downs are expected to be negligible while equipment holding costs will continue until we are able to dispose of brisas project related equipment 
interest expense  which was previously capitalized and comprised of approximately million of actual interest paid plus an amount related to accretion of the face value of the convertible note  is expected to stay at substantially the same level as item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  deposits  advances and other  accrued interest and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these instruments 
fair value estimates are made at the balance sheet date based on relevant market information but involve uncertainties and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
the company currently does not enter into any hedging transactions 
the company is exposed to various risks including credit risk  liquidity risk  currency risk and interest rate risk as described below which are substantially the same as the preceding period a credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to meet its obligations to the company 
the company s primary exposure to credit risk is through its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances 
the company diversifies its cash holdings into major canadian and us financial institutions and corporations 
b liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
the company has historically managed this risk by maintaining adequate cash balances through equity and debt offerings to meet its obligations 
with respect to the convertible notes  the holders have the option to require the company to repurchase the notes on june   for the principal amount of the notes plus unpaid interest and the company may satisfy this obligation  in whole or in part  by delivering common shares 
the following table presents the company s payments due on accounts payable and accrued expenses and its undiscounted interest and principal payments due on its convertible notes  based on the estimate that the term of the notes will end on june  if the notes were to reach their contractual maturity date of june   additional interest payments wou ld amount to million over the additional ten year term of the notes 
payments due by period total less than year years more than years ap and accruals   interest    principal   total    c transactions denominated in foreign currency are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which have an impact on the statement of operations 
the company s cash and other monetary assets and liabilities that are held in venezuelan and canadian currency are subject to fluctuations against the us dollar 
a weakening of those currencies against the us dollar would have increased decreased the company s net loss from the translation of foreign currency denominated financial instruments  as at december  and  by the amounts shown below 
venezuelan bol var   canadian dollar   total   the company limits the amount of currency held in non u 
s dollar accounts and does not actively use derivative instruments to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
d the company may be subject to the risk that changes in market interest rates will cause fluctuations in the fair values of its financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents earn floating market rates of interest 
other current financial assets and liabilities are generally not exposed to this risk because of their immediate or short term maturity 
the interest rate on the company s convertible notes is fixed and therefore the interest payments are not subject to changes in market rates of interest
