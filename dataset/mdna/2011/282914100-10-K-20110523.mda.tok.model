item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunications services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications as well as web based conferencing and unified communications services 
we offer the x virtual office hosted pbx service  x complete contact center service  x trunking service  x hosted key system service  x mobiletalk service  x virtual meeting web conferencing service  the x virtual office pro unified communications solution and x managed hosting and cloud based computing solutions 
as of march   we had more than  business customers 
each business customer subscribes to a number of various lines and services eg physical phone extensions  virtual extensions  fax lines  toll free numbers  receptionist software  unified communications services  etc 
since fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above under part i  item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under the terms of our typical subscription agreement  new customers can terminate their service within days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
we have determined that we have sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the day trial period 
therefore  we recognize new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped  net of an allowance for expected cancellations 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the x service with the accompanying x ip telephone constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of asc  we allocate x revenues  including activation fees  among the x ip telephones and subscriber services based on the fair value determined by their relative selling prices 
revenues allocated to these devices are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the day trial period 
all other revenues are recognized when the related services are provided 
we record revenue net of any sales related taxes that are billed to our customers 
we believe this approach results in financial statements that are more easily understood by investors 
the cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue 
at the time of each revenue transaction  we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product sales to retailers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user and the trial period has expired 
under our revenue recognition accounting principles  if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue until we can demonstrate objectively that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or that the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  we recognize revenue on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above under item a  risk factors 
collectability of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   the accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  including a reserve for disputed credits  and an estimated returns reserve of  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income and other taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book tax accounting differences for items such as deferred revenue 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we have received inquiries  demands or audit requests from several states and municipal taxing and agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from the customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
we recorded no expense for the years ended march  and and an expense of  for the year ended march   respectively  as our estimate of the increase in probable tax exposure for such assessments 
stock based compensation we account for our employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the stock plan  director option plan  nonstatutory stock option plan and the stock plan and stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan collectively purchase plans under the provisions of asc stock compensation 
under the provisions of asc  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by asc and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal included both the unvested portion of stock based awards granted prior to april  and stock based awards granted subsequent to april  stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal were measured based on asc formerly sfas no 
criteria  whereas stock options granted subsequent to april  were measured based on asc formerly sfas no 
r criteria 
in conjunction with the adoption of asc  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to april  has been recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in fiscal included the impact of estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to value option grants and stock purchase rights under the purchase plans for actual and pro forma stock based compensation we used the black scholes option valuation model 
fair value determined using the black scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility  expected life  risk free interest rates and future dividend payments 
for fiscal years  and  we used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value 
the expected life assumptions represent the weighted average period stock based awards are expecting to remain outstanding 
these expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock based award grants with similar vesting periods 
the risk free interest was based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded us treasury securities in the over the counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout 
asc requires us to calculate the additional paid in capital pool apic pool available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting asc  as if we had adopted asc at its effective date of january  there are two allowable methods to calculate our apic pool the long form method or the short form method as set forth in asc we have elected to use the long form method under which we track each award grant on an employee by employee basis and grant by grant basis to determine if there is a tax benefit or tax deficiency for such award 
we then compared the fair value expense to the tax deduction received for each grant and aggregated the benefits and deficiencies to establish the apic pool 
due to the adoption of asc  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  we are not recognizing deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
we use the with and without approach as described in asc  in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax and as such  we recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 
on january   when our stock price closed at per share our board of directors approved the acceleration of unvested stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
 of these shares are subject to options held by our executive officers and directors 
these options of our executive officers and directors  taken as a whole  have a weighted average exercise price of per share and range from to per share  and a weighted average remaining vesting term of years 
approximately million of the million stock based compensation charge in the fourth quarter of applies to the options held by our executive officers and directors 
selected operating statistics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the selected operating statistics include the following selected operating statistics march  dec

 june  march  dec

business customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of business customers that terminated after the expiration of the day trial during that period by the simple average number of business customers during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of business customers during the period is the number of business customers on the first day of the period plus the number of business customers on the last day of the period divided by two 
business customers are defined as customers paying for service 
customers that are currently in the day trial period are considered to be customers that are paying for service 
business customer average monthly service revenue per customer is service revenue from business customers in the period divided by the number of months in the period divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
business subscriber acquisition cost per service is defined as the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies for business services sold during the period divided by the number of gross business services added during the period 
business customer subscriber acquisition cost is business subscriber acquisition cost per service times the average number of services subscribed to per business customer 
we believe it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually  as we do not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenues years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands service revenues     percentage of total revenues service revenues consist primarily of revenues attributable to the provision of our x services and royalties earned under our voip technology licenses 
we expect that x service revenues will continue to comprise nearly all of our service revenues for the foreseeable future 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to an million increase in x service revenues resulting from growth of our business service subscriber base and a million increase in professional service fees 
our business service subscriber base grew from approximately  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  customers on march  the increase was partially offset by a decrease of million attributable to residential services 
the decrease in service revenues from residential customers resulted from a reduction in our residential customer base 
these changes are consistent with the redirection of our marketing efforts toward our business customer service 
we expect the trends to continue in future periods 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million increase in x service revenues resulting from the growth of our business service subscriber base

however  product revenue attributable to residential and video service declined by million 
the decrease in product revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year resulted from a selling price reduction as we elected to increase the subsidy on ip telephone sales to business service customers and a decline in product revenue attributable to residential and videophone service customers 
no single customer represented more than of our total revenues during fiscal  or the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands years ended march  united states    other locations cost of revenues years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of service revenues    percentage of service revenues cost of service revenues primarily consists of costs associated with network operations and related personnel  telephony origination and termination services provided by third party carriers and technology license and royalty expenses

the increase in cost of service revenues was partially offset by a reduction in the prices we pay to third party network service vendors  reduction of related accruals  as well as our use of multiple third party network provider vendors  which allows us to route call and network traffic to the third party network provider vendor with the most favorable pricing  and a decrease in consultant and outside service expenses 
cost of service revenues for fiscal compared with fiscal decreased million primarily due to a reduction in the prices we pay to third party network service vendors  as well as our use of multiple third party network provider vendors 
the reduction in pricing by third party network service vendors was partially offset by an increase in personnel and licenses fee costs compared with the prior fiscal year 
service margin has improved because revenue from business customers has a higher margin than revenue from residential customers and product margins have declined due to more aggressive discounting on the telephones

we allocate a portion of service revenues to product revenues but these revenues are less than the cost of the product 
the increase in the cost of product revenues for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in the shipment of equipment to our business customers 
the increase in cost of product revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in freight costs 
the increase in the cost of product revenues for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in the shipment of equipment to our business customers 
the increase in cost of product revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in shipments of equipment to residential customers  a million reduction in payroll and related expenses  and a million reduction in freight costs

we expense research and development costs  including software development costs  as they are incurred 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to the sale of our french research and development subsidiary in april offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses in the united states 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in overall expenses partially offset by an increase in personnel and contractor headcount expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer service  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include outsourced customer service call center operations  sales commissions  as well as trade show  advertising and other marketing and promotional expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and related expenses  a million increase in advertising expenses  a million increase in legal expenses  including a million accrual related to the memorandum of understanding to settle a lawsuit against us  a million increase in recruiting expenses  a million increase in amortization of customer relationship intangible asset and a million increase in bad debt expense 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in consulting and outside service expenses primarily due to reduction in third party customer service fees  reduction or conversion of temporary personnel  and reduction of outside service expense due to one time project completed in fiscal  a million reduction in indirect channel commission expenses  a million reduction in printing expenses and a million reduction in telephone expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal was due to a million decrease in employee and temporary personnel costs  primarily due to a decrease in asc stock based compensation expense as a result of accelerating the vesting period of stock options in fiscal  million decrease in advertising  public relations and other marketing and promotional expenses  a million decrease in sales agent and retailer commissions  a million decrease in credit card processing fees  million decrease in travel and meal expenses  a million decrease in telephone expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in facility expenses 
interest income and other  net years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands interest income and other  net percentage of total revenues our interest income and other  net  primarily consists of interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
this item primarily consisted of capital gains distribution and interest income in fiscal  and the increase in other income for fiscal from fiscal consists primarily of an increase in capital gain distributions due on mutual funds purchased in the third quarter of fiscal the decrease in other income for fiscal from fiscal consists primarily of a reduction in interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances due to lower interest rates 
income on change in fair value of warrant liability years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability percentage of total revenues in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in fiscal and  we issued warrants in three different equity financings 
the change in income on change in fair value of the warrant liability for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the partial exercise and expiration of all remaining warrants in the third quarter of fiscal the decrease in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal from fiscal occurred because the fair value of warrants and warrant liability increased due to an increase in our stock price and the expected stock price volatility  offset by a reduction in the risk free interest rate and contractual life of the warrants  which are the primary assumptions applied to the black scholes model which we have used to calculate the fair value of the warrants 
provision for income taxes years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands provision for income taxes percentage of total revenues the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  differed from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because we utilized prior net operating losses and available tax credits while we have a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
therefore  our income tax provision has consisted primarily of minimum and capital state income taxes and foreign income tax 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carry forward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we have applied a full valuation allowance as of march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and investments 
by comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal cash used in or provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income  sales of subscriptions  changes in working capital accounts  particularly in deferred revenue due to timing of annual plan renewals  add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  and the expense associated with stock based awards 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million used in investing activities in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal is primarily related to the acquisition of investments million  the acquisition of central host in may million  a strategic investment in stonyfish in april million and the purchase of additional equipment million related to the build out of our new east coast data center and growth in our data centers on the west coast for voice and managed hosting services 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million provided by financing activities in fiscal our financing activities for fiscal used cash of million for the repurchase of shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan and million for the buyout of employee stock options under the existing provisions of our stock plan and nonstatutory stock option plan 
the use of cash in financing activities in fiscal was partially offset by million in cash provided by the issuance of common stock under our purchase plans  the issuance of shares related to the exercise of warrants  and the issuance of restricted shares 
to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal the increase in cash flow was primarily due to a decline in third party network service expenses and a decline in stock based compensation expense  offset partially by discounting of equipment sold to business service customers during fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million provided by investing activities in fiscal the decrease in cash flow from investing activities during fiscal is primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under our purchase plans which was offset by million used to repurchase shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
although we have achieved positive cash flows from operations in the fiscal year ended march   and  historical net losses and negative cash flows have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
based on our current expectations  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
nevertheless  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new services or products  the costs to ensure access to our telecommunications services  the continuing market acceptance of our service and products  the amount of future share repurchase programs  and the extent to which we use our cash to acquire other businesses 
however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests  but we cannot be assured that our capital raising efforts will be successful 
contractual obligations future operating lease payments  capital lease payments and purchase obligations at march  for the next five years were as follows in thousands year ending march  total capital leases office leases purchase obligations third party customer support provider  third party network service providers open purchase orders in march and august  we entered into a series of noncancelable capital lease agreements for office equipment bearing interest at various rates 
assets under capital lease at march  totaled  with accumulated amortization of  on may   we entered into a three year lease for a new headquarters facility in sunnyvale  california that expires in fiscal the facility leases include rent escalation clauses and require us to pay utilities and normal maintenance costs 
rent expense is reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
in the third quarter of  we amended our contract with one of our third party customer support vendors containing a minimum monthly commitment of approximately  the agreement requires a day notice to terminate 
at march   the total remaining obligation under the contract was million 
we entered into contracts with multiple vendors for third party network service providers which expire on various dates in fiscal and at march   the total remaining obligations under these contracts were million 
at march   we had open purchase orders of  primarily related to inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital leases and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
