item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primary factors that determine operating profitability 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a change in previously recorded revenue and profit 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the majority of our work is performed on a fixed price basis 
contract revenue is accrued based on engineering estimates for the physical percent complete for dredging and estimates of remaining costs to complete for demolition 
we use accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for accounting policies relating to our use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs  revenue recognition  combining and segmenting contracts and change order claim recognition 
percentage of completion accounting relies on the use of estimates in the process of determining income earned 
the cumulative impact of revisions to estimates is reflected in the period in which these changes become known 
due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we are subject to risks related to our international dredging operations 
revenue from foreign contracts and its percentage to total dredging revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  foreign revenue in us  percent of dredging revenue from foreign countries international operations subject us to additional potential risks  including uncertainties concerning import and export license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  reduced middle eastern demand as a result of fluctuations in the price of oil  the primary export in the middle east  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states  requirements of foreign laws  policies and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations without additional expense  taxation issues  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act  difficulty in enforcing our contractual rights  currency fluctuations  and under insured political  cultural and economic uncertainties  including acts of terrorism and civil unrest 

table of contents one customer currently accounts for a significant portion of our international revenue 
revenue from contracts with the government of bahrain and entities with which it does business and its percentage to total foreign dredging revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  bahrain government dredging revenue in us  percent of foreign dredging revenue from the bahrain government revenue from foreign projects over the last three years has been concentrated in bahrain and primarily with the government of bahrain 
the contraction in the middle east real estate market has slowed the rate of the region s infrastructure development 
if the government of bahrain further curtails its infrastructure investment or diversifies its use of dredging vendors  our revenue from this customer could decline further 
in february and march  bahrain experienced civil unrest that could result in governmental instability 
in response thereto  the government of bahrain has instituted several measures  including a national curfew  that have impacted our ability to execute on projects in bahrain 
it is uncertain whether this civil unrest will continue  whether the current protests and other activities will lead to any meaningful government changes  and what additional restrictions  if any  the bahrain government will establish 
if the government changes  these measures are sustained  or additional restrictions are established  our bahrain dredging operations  including the value of our assets related to such operations  may be adversely affected 
in addition  it is uncertain if current events in bahrain will alter the government s plans for infrastructure investment 
there are integration and consolidation risks associated with the matteson acquisition 
future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses  unexpected liabilities and risks associated with entering new markets  and we may be unable to profitably operate these businesses 
on december   we acquired matteson 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire additional companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
the matteson acquisition and future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including risks associated with entering new markets  diversion of management s attention from our existing business  failure to retain key personnel or customers of any acquired business  assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and potential impairment of acquired intangible assets 
in addition  we may not have the appropriate management  financial or other resources needed to integrate any businesses that we acquire 
any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and unexpected liabilities 
the amount of our estimated backlog is subject to change and not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
our contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues that we will realize under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
for dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site  the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work 
for demolition contracts  these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project  relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the customer 
however  these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or 
table of contents profitability 
in addition  a significant amount of our dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government  subject to our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
below is our dredging backlog from federal government contracts as of december    and and the percentage of those contracts to total backlog as of the same date 
the amount of our federal government dredging backlog at december  includes amounts acquired in connection with the matteson acquisition 
year ended december  federal government dredging backlog in us  percent of dredging backlog from federal government if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations  our revenue could suffer 
our contracts with federal  state and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations and other contract provisions 
serious violations of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments and fines and suspension from future government contracting 
if we are suspended from government work for any reason  we could suffer a material reduction in revenue and cash flows 
in addition  we may be subject to litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts  referred to in this annual report as qui tam  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
qui tam actions are sealed by the court at the time of filing 
the only parties privy to the information in the complaint are the complainant  the us government and the court 
therefore  it is possible that qui tam actions have been filed against us and that we are not aware of such actions or have been ordered by the court not to discuss them until the seal is lifted 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure for qui tam actions 
we have indebtedness  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions 
as of december   we had indebtedness of million consisting of million of senior subordinated notes and a million note issued as part of the matteson acquisition 
in january  we refinanced our senior subordinated notes with the issuance of million senior unsecured notes 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow up to million under our revolving credit facility 
our debt could require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures  pay dividends and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industries  affects our competitiveness compared to our less leveraged competitors  increase our exposure to both general and industry specific adverse economic conditions  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 

table of contents if we are unable  in the future  to obtain bonding or letters of credit for our dredging contracts  our ability to obtain future dredging contracts will be limited  thereby adversely affecting our business 
we  like all dredging service providers  are generally required to post bonds in connection with our domestic dredging contracts and bonds or letters of credit with our foreign dredging contracts to ensure job completion if we ever fail to finish a project 
we have entered into a bonding agreement with travelers  pursuant to which travelers acts as surety  issues bid bonds  performance bonds and payment bonds  and provides guarantees required by us in the day to day operations of our dredging business 
however  under certain circumstances as specified in the agreement  travelers is not obligated under the bonding agreement to issue future bonds for us 
with respect to our foreign dredging business  we generally obtain letters of credit under our senior credit facility and a separate facility which is supported by ex im under ex im s working capital guarantee program 
however  the amount of letters of credit under these facilities is limited 
in addition  access to our senior credit facility and the ex im facility may be limited by failure to meet certain financial requirements or other defined requirements 
if we are unable to obtain bonds or letters of credit  our ability to take on future work would be severely limited 
our business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade  or if those provisions were modified or repealed 
we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict dredging in us waters and maritime transportation between points in the united states to vessels operating under the us flag  built in the united states  at least owned and operated by us citizens and manned by us crews 
we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our common stock to ensure compliance with these laws 
if we do not comply with these restrictions  we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us market  and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer  resulting in severe penalties  including permanent loss of us dredging rights for our vessels  fines or forfeiture of the vessels 
in the past  interest groups have unsuccessfully lobbied congress to modify or repeal the jones act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for us flag vessels under the jones act 
we believe that continued efforts may be made to modify or repeal the jones act or other federal laws currently benefiting us flag vessels 
if these efforts are ever successful  it could result in significantly increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel and may also increase due to changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel 
accordingly  it is likely that the operating costs of our vessels will increase 
the average age of our more significant vessels as of december   by equipment type  is as follows 
table of contents type of equipment quantity average age in years hydraulic dredges hopper dredges mechanical dredges unloaders drillboats material and other barges total remaining economic life has not been presented because it is not reasonably quantifiable because  to the extent that market conditions warrant the expenditures  we can prolong the vessels lives indefinitely 
we operate in an industry where a significant portion of competitors equipment is of a similar age 
it is common in the dredging industry to make maintenance and capital expenditures in order to extend the economic life of equipment 
in addition  changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards  as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self regulatory organizations and customer requirements or competition  may require us  along with others in our industry  to make additional expenditures 
for example  if the us coast guard enacts new standards  we may be required to make significant expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment 
in order to satisfy any such requirement  we may need to take our vessels out of service for extended periods of time  with corresponding losses of revenues 
environmental regulations could force us to incur capital and operational costs 
our industry  and more specifically  our operations  facilities and vessels  are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to  among other things dredging operations  the disposal of dredged material  protection of wetlands  storm water and waste water discharges  demolition activities  asbestos removal  transportation and disposal of wastes and other regulated materials  air emissions  and remediation of contaminated soil  sediments  surface water and groundwater 
we  and others who participate in the marine industry  are also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine species and habitats 
compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay permitting and or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs 
these delays and increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
non compliance can also result in fines  penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury  as well as damages to property and natural resources 
certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  and the oil pollution act of impose strict and  under some circumstances joint and several  liability on owners and operators of facilities and vessels for investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials  and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources 
our past and ongoing operations involve the use and from time to time the release or discharge of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws 
we have remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary  but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if  for example  third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered 

table of contents our projects may involve demolition  excavation  transportation  management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials 
various laws strictly regulate the removal  treatment and transportation of hazardous waste and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials 
our demolition business  for example  requires us to transport and dispose of hazardous substances and other wastes  such as asbestos 
services rendered in connection with hazardous substance and material removal and site development may involve professional judgments by licensed experts about the nature of soil conditions and other physical conditions  including the extent to which hazardous substances and materials are present  and about the probable effect of procedures to mitigate problems or otherwise affect those conditions 
if the judgments and the recommendations based upon those judgments are incorrect  we may be liable for resulting damages  which may be material 
the failure of certain contractual protections  including any indemnification from our customers or subcontractors  to protect us from incurring such liability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
environmental requirements have generally become more stringent over time  for example in the areas of air emissions controls for vessels and ballast treatment and handling 
new or stricter enforcement of existing laws  the discovery of currently unknown conditions or accidental discharges of regulated materials in the future could cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which might be significant 
we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 
increased concern about the potential impact of greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide resulting from combustion of fossil fuels on climate change has resulted in efforts to regulate their emission 
for example  there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations concerning ghg emissions including cap and trade legislation may be enacted  which could result in increased compliance costs for us 
legislation  international protocols  regulation or other restrictions on ghg emissions could also affect our customers 
such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for our customers or  in some cases  prevent a project from going forward  thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
additionally  in our normal course of operations  we use a significant amount of fossil fuels 
the costs of controlling our ghg emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances in response to any regulatory change could increase materially 
our business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage by our unionized labor force 
we are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the us that govern our industry s relationships with our unionized hourly workforce 
specifically  four primary agreements apply to approximately of these employees 
our three contracts with local operators union for the northern  southern and gulf regions  representing approximately of our unionized workforce  are set to expire in october our agreement with seafarers international union expires in february the inability to successfully renegotiate contracts with these unions as they expire  or any future strikes  employee slowdowns or similar actions by one or more unions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
our employees are covered by federal laws that may provide seagoing employees remedies for job related claims in addition to those provided by state laws 
substantially all of our seagoing employees are covered by provisions of the jones act and general maritime law 
these laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job related injuries in federal or state courts 
because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers compensation statutes with respect to our seagoing employees  we have 
table of contents greater exposure for claims made by these employees as compared to industries whose employees are not covered by these provisions 
our business is subject to significant operating risks and hazards that could result in damage or destruction to persons or property  which could result in losses or liabilities to us 
the dredging and demolition businesses are generally subject to a number of risks and hazards  including environmental hazards  industrial accidents  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  cave ins below water levels  collisions  disruption of transportation services and flooding 
these risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  dredges  transportation vessels  other maritime structures and buildings  and could also result in personal injury  environmental damage  performance delays  monetary losses or legal liability to third parties 
our current insurance coverage may not be adequate  and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates  or at all 
we maintain various insurance policies  including hull and machinery  general liability and personal injury 
we partially self insure risks covered by our policies 
we are not required to  and do not  specifically set aside funds for the self insured portion of claims 
at any given time  we are subject to multiple personal injury claims and we maintain substantial loss accruals for these claims 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms  or at all 
our inability to obtain such insurance coverage at acceptable rates or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
our demolition business includes key customer relationships and our reputation in the massachusetts construction market  both of which have been developed and maintained primarily by our demolition employees 
loss of any of these elements could materially reduce our demolition revenues and profits 
demolition contracts are entered into on a project by project basis  so we do not have continuing contractual commitments with our demolition customers beyond the terms of the current contract 
we benefit from key relationships with certain general and construction contractors in the massachusetts market 
we also benefit from our reputation in the massachusetts market developed over years of successfully performing on projects 
both of these aspects of the business were developed and are maintained primarily by the officers of nasdi s parent company 
the inability to maintain relationships with these customers or obtain new customers based on nasdi s reputation could reduce the revenue and profitability from demolition contracts 
our inability to retain certain executives could have a material adverse affect on our demolition segment s current customer relationships and reputation 
our common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership 
we are subject to government regulations pursuant to the dredging act  the jones act  the shipping act and the vessel documentation laws set forth in chapter of title of the united states code 
these statutes require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers or dredging in the navigable waters of the us to be owned and controlled by us citizens 
the us citizenship ownership and control standards require the vessel owning entity to be at least us citizen owned 
our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting non citizenship ownership of our capital stock 
if our board of directors determines that persons who are not citizens of the us own more than of our outstanding capital stock or more than of our voting power  we may redeem such stock 
the required redemption price could be materially different from the current price of our common stock or the price at which the non citizen acquired the common stock 
if a non citizen purchases our common stock  there can be no assurance that he will not be required to divest the shares and such divestiture could result in a material loss 
such restrictions and redemption rights 
table of contents may make our equity securities less attractive to potential investors  which may result in our common stock having a lower market price than it might have in the absence of such restrictions and redemption rights 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover that you may consider favorable 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also deter  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
these provisions include limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals  the authority of our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and to issue additional shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board or stockholder approval were obtained 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  discourage others from making tender offers for our shares  lower the market price of our stock or impede the ability of our stockholders to change our management  even if such changes would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our stockholders may not receive dividends because of restrictions in our debt agreements  delaware law and state regulatory requirements 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the agreements governing our debt  including our senior credit agreement  our bonding agreements and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
in addition  under delaware law  our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our surplus  as calculated in accordance with the delaware general corporation law  or  if we do not have a surplus  it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
to the extent we do not have adequate surplus or net profits  we will be prohibited from paying dividends 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for holders to resell our common stock when they want or at prices that they find attractive 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in market conditions  quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  
table of contents changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of strategic developments  significant contracts  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  changes in the economy and the financial markets  departures of key personnel  changes in governmental regulations  and geopolitical conditions  such as acts or threats of terrorism  political instability  civil unrest or military conflicts 
in addition  in recent years  global stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
future issuances of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially and adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
the domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets have experienced and are experiencing significant volatility  disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability 
should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness  we may not be able to obtain such additional funds 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock 
without sufficient liquidity  we will be forced to curtail our operations  and our business will suffer 
the principal sources of our liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in the event these resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn 
if internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate paid with respect to our fixed rate indebtedness and heating oil commodity swap contracts to hedge the risk that fluctuations in diesel fuel prices will have an adverse impact on cash flows associated with our domestic dredging contracts 
the united states 
table of contents congress has passed  and the president has signed into law  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act 
the financial reform act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including foreign currency hedging transactions 
the financial reform act requires the commodities futures and trading commission to promulgate rules relating to the financial reform act 
when the rules relating to the financial reform act are established  we will assess the effect  if any  they will have on us 
the rules adopted by the commodities futures and trading commission may in the future significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic hedges to manage our interest expense and reduce our fuel commodity uncertainty and thus protect cash flows 
in addition  the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the financial reform act s new requirements  and the costs of their compliance will likely be passed on to customers such as ourselves  thus potentially decreasing the benefits to us of swap and hedging transactions and potentially reducing our profitability 
the current weakness in the economic environment and other factors could lead to our goodwill and other intangible assets becoming impaired  which may require us to take significant non cash charges against earnings 
under current accounting guidelines  we must assess  at least annually and potentially more frequently  whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non cash charge against earnings  which charge could materially adversely affect our reported net income and our stock price 
we test goodwill annually for impairment in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently should circumstances dictate 
a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the economic environment  slower growth rates or our stock price falling below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary  then we would be required to record a non cash charge against earnings  which  in turn  could have a material adverse affect on our reported net income and the book value of our stockholders equity

item legal proceedings the company or its former subsidiary  natco limited partnership  is named as a defendant in approximately lawsuits  the majority of which were filed between and in these lawsuits  the plaintiffs allege personal injury  primarily pleural abnormality and or asbestosis  and or death  from exposure to asbestos on the company s vessels 
the vast majority of these lawsuits have been filed in the northern district of ohio and a few in the eastern district of michigan 
all cases filed in federal courts were consolidated in philadelphia in under the multi district litigation process 
all of the maritime cases  including those filed against the company prior to  were administratively dismissed in may and any cases filed since that time have similarly been administratively transferred to the inactive docket 
over the last year  the philadelphia presiding judge has reactivated hundreds of lawsuits in an effort to clean out the administrative docket 
prior to the commencement of discovery in any of the reactivated cases  counsel for plaintiffs agreed to name a group of cases that they intended to pursue and to dismiss the remaining cases without prejudice 
plaintiffs have now named  cases that they intend to pursue  including cases against the company  each of which involves one plaintiff

management does not believe that any of the lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is presently unable to quantify the amounts of damages being sought in these lawsuits because none of the complaints specify a damage amount  therefore  the company has not accrued any amounts in respect of these lawsuits 
the company does not believe that it is probable that losses from these claims could be material  and an estimate of a range of losses relating to these claims cannot reasonably be made 
on april   a class action complaint was filed in the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana  on behalf of louisiana citizens who allegedly suffered property damage from the floodwaters that flooded new orleans and surrounding areas when hurricane katrina hit the area on august  the reed complaint 
the reed complaint names as defendants the us government  great lakes dredge dock company and numerous other dredging companies that completed dredging projects on behalf of the army corps of engineers in the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo between and the reed complaint alleges that the dredging of mrgo caused the destruction of louisiana wetlands  which had provided a natural barrier against some storms and hurricanes 
the reed complaint alleges that this loss of natural barriers contributed to the failure of levees as katrina floodwaters damaged plaintiffs property 
the reed complaint asserts claims of negligence  warranty  concealment and violations of the water pollution control act 
other plaintiffs have filed similar class action complaints and one mass tort case together with the reed complaint  the katrina claims 
all of these cases raise the same claims as the reed complaint 
the amount of claimed damages in these claims is not stated  but is presumed to be significant

the plaintiffs did not file a writ of certiorari to the us supreme court 
as a result  the dismissal of the katrina claims is final 
on october   great lakes and the other dredging companies filed in federal district court for exoneration or limitation of liability under the limitation of liability act the limitation action 
the limitation action stays all outstanding katrina claims against great lakes in the district court  pending resolution of the limitation action 
approximately  claims by individuals  businesses  and the state of louisiana were filed against great lakes asserting the same basic theory of liability as in the katrina claims and seeking damages significantly in excess of the million limitation bond posted by great lakes 
in addition  all of the dredging companies  including great lakes  filed cross claims against each other in the limitation action seeking contribution and indemnification 
great lakes currently believes that it has meritorious claims for either exoneration from all liability or limitation of liability to not more than million  which is the value of the vessels which conducted the mrgo dredging work 
these defenses include arguments for both statutory and constitutional immunity from liability 
on september   great lakes filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims 
the district court granted the motion on june   dismissing these claims with prejudice

on december   gldd acquisitions corp  then the company s parent corporation  was merged with a subsidiary of aldabra acquisition corporation  or aldabra 
this merger  referred to in this annual report as the aldabra merger  was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
under this method of accounting  the company was the acquiring company for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the merger was treated as the equivalent of the company issuance of stock for the net monetary assets of aldabra accompanied by a 
table of contents recapitalization 
the net monetary assets of aldabra  primarily cash  were stated at their fair value  which was equivalent to the carrying value  and accordingly no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded 
prior to the merger in  the company had redeemable preferred stock 
dividends on the company s series a and series b preferred stock were cumulative semiannually and payable upon declaration at a rate of 
the preferred stock was recorded at its redemption and liquidation value of per share  or million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
prior to the merger  there was million in accumulated dividends outstanding 
the holders of preferred stock were entitled to payment before any capital distribution was made with respect to any junior securities and had no voting rights 
as a result of the merger on december   the preferred stock and accumulated dividends were exchanged for shares of aldabra stock 
the fair value of stock received was in excess of the carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock at the time of the exchange 
therefore  the net loss available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was adjusted by million in determining earnings per share 
the historical results prior to the merger date of december   were that of gldd acquisitions corp 
the merger was considered a reverse acquisition  and therefore the weighted average shares outstanding for all prior periods were retroactively restated to reflect the shares that were issued to acquire gldd acquisitions corp common stock 
accordingly   were deemed to be outstanding at the beginning of the earliest period presented

it also included the purchase of another vessel for million  funded through a sale leaseback transaction  as well as the buy out of certain equipment previously under operating leases for million

the company presents ebitda as an additional measure by which to evaluate the company s operating trends 
the company believes that ebitda is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that all of the company s primary stakeholders ie its stockholders  bondholders and banks use ebitda to evaluate the company s period to period performance 
additionally  management believes that ebitda provides a transparent measure of the company s recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for this reason  the company uses a measure based upon ebitda to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the company s incentive plan 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  amounts determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap including a operating income as an indicator of operating performance  or b cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
as such  the company s use of ebitda  instead of a gaap measure  has limitations as an analytical tool  including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization  which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the company s business 
for these reasons  the company uses operating income to measure the company s operating performance and uses ebitda only as a supplement

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is the largest provider of dredging services in the united states 
in addition  the company is the only us dredging service provider with significant international operations  which represented approximately of the company s dredging revenues for  down from the company s three year average of 
dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil  sand or rock 
the us dredging market consists of three primary types of work capital  beach nourishment and maintenance 
the company s bid market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic projects on which the company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints 
the company has experienced an average combined bid market share in the us of over the past three years  including  and of the capital  beach nourishment and maintenance sectors  respectively 
these bid market shares do not reflect the activities of matteson prior to december  with its acquisition of matteson  on january  the company began to provide the following additional dredging and other services inland lake and river dredging  inland levee and construction dredging  environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction 
in  matteson s revenues were million 
our fleet of dredges  of which are deployed internationally  material transportation barges  two drillboats  and numerous other specialized support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any us dredging company 
the mobility of the company s fleet enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities to employ our dredges 
the company estimates the replacement cost of the company s fleet to be in excess of billion in the current market 
our largest domestic dredging customer is the army corp of engineers corps which is responsible for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of us waterways 
approximately of our dredging revenues resulted from contracts with federal government agencies  including the corps as well as other federal entities such as the us coast guard and the us navy 
this is comparable with the company s three year average 
the company also owns a majority interest in nasdi  a demolition service provider headquartered in the boston  massachusetts area 
nasdi s principal services consist of interior and exterior demolition of commercial and industrial buildings  salvage and recycling of related materials  and removal of hazardous substances and materials 
the majority of nasdi s work has historically been performed in the new england area  however  nasdi is currently expanding into the new york area and other markets including marine and bridge demolition 
in january  the company acquired a interest in yankee  a provider of environmental remediation services including asbestos abatement and removal of other hazardous materials for private and governmental entities 
prior to this acquisition  yankee served as a subcontractor on many nasdi projects  and continues to serve as a subcontractor many nasdi projects subsequent to the acquisition 
the company has a ownership interest in amboy 
amboy s primary business is mining sand from the entrance channel to new york harbor in order to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and building construction 
together with the company s amboy joint venture partner  the company owns a interest in 
table of contents land that is adjacent to amboy s property and may be used in conjunction with amboy s operations 
the company s investment in amboy is accounted for using the equity method 
the company operates in two reporting segments dredging and demolition 
contract revenues most of the company s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the types of equipment required to perform the specified service and the estimated project duration affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid 
the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  based on the company s engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost to cost approach for demolition projects 
for dredging projects  costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project 
for demolition projects  contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation due to the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition 
the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues 
contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered  necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal 
significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project 
these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses 
costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term rentals  fuel  subcontracts  rentals and project overhead 
hourly labor is generally hired on a project by project basis 
costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
generally  capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects  while beach nourishment projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to variability in weather conditions 
the company s cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs  including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term equipment rentals  averaging approximately to of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years 
during the year  both equipment utilization and the timing of cost expenditures fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  the company allocates these equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses 
specifically  at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on the company s dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis 
in the fourth quarter  any over and under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year 
as a result of this methodology  the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period 

table of contents primary factors that determine operating profitability dredging 
the company s results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors bid wins and dredge employment the company s dredging segment generates revenues when the company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project 
although the company s dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full time basis 
if a dredge is idle ie  the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle 
project and dredge mix the company s domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital  maintenance and beach nourishment work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work 
in addition  the company s dredging projects vary in duration and  in general  projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period 
moreover  the company s dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects 
accordingly  the company s dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities 
the company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross margin ie  gross profit divided by revenues for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges 
the company s expected gross margin for a project is based upon the company s estimates at the time of the bid 
although the company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin  the company cannot control the type of dredging projects that are bid from time to time  the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed 
as a result  in some quarters the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively high expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed and in other quarters  the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively low expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed 
project execution the company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with its project estimates 
in general  the company s ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including weather  variances from estimated project conditions  equipment mobilization time periods  unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the company s control 
if the company experiences any of these events and circumstances  the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed  as applicable  and  consequently  the company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates 
the company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control  however  these situations are inherent in dredging 
demolition 
the company s demolition segment generates revenues when the company is awarded a contract for demolition services and performs the project 
the company s revenues from its demolition segment increase or decrease based upon market demand 
like the company s dredging segment  results of operations for the company s demolition segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the company s ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  as well as the related footnote 
table of contents disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
percentage of completion method of revenue recognition the company s contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which is by its nature based on an estimation process 
for dredging projects  the company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion 
for demolition projects  the company uses estimates of remaining costs to complete to determine the percentage of project completion 
in preparing the company s estimates  it draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and demolition businesses and its database of historical dredging information to assure that its estimates are as accurate as possible  given current circumstances 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because i goodwill is a material asset and ii the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july each year 
the company operates in two reporting segments dredging and demolition 
these reporting segments are the company s operating segments and reporting units at which the company tests goodwill for impairment 
the company assesses the fair values of its reporting units using both a market approach and an income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future market growth trends  forecasted revenues and expenses  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the estimates are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value  and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual results differ from those estimates 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through comparison to comparable companies 
under the market approach  the company uses the guideline public company method by applying estimated market based enterprise value multiples to the reporting unit s estimated revenue and ebitda 
the company analyzed companies that performed similar services or are considered competitors 
due to the fact that there are no public companies that are direct competitors  the company weighed the results of this approach less than the income approach 
at december   the majority of goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by madison dearborn capital partners iv  lp on december  goodwill was allocated between the company s two reporting segments  dredging and demolition  based on the value assigned to each segment at that time 
at both december  and  dredging goodwill was million and demolition goodwill was million 
the company performed its most recent annual test of impairment as of july  for the goodwill in both the dredging and demolition segments with no indication of goodwill impairment as of the test date 
as of 
table of contents the test date  the fair value of both the dredging segment and the demolition segment were in excess of their carrying values by approximately 
no goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter for either segment because no triggering event occurred which would require such a test 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
our policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset s book value and fair market value 
our policy is to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows using financial projections that require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management 
changes in these projections may expose us to future impairment charges 
if a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs  the company would evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate 
self insurance reserves the company self insures costs associated with its seagoing employees covered by the provisions of jones act  workers compensation claims  hull and equipment liability and general business liabilities up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that the company will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
in determining its estimates  the company considers historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves

table of contents components of contract revenues the following table sets forth  by segment and type of work  the company s contract revenues for the years ended december in thousands revenues dredging capital us capital foreign beach nourishment maintenance total dredging revenues demolition total revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over dredging revenues of million 
this increase was primarily due to higher revenues in the capital and beach markets more than offsetting lower revenues in the foreign and maintenance markets 
highlights from the company s primary dredging sectors are as follows revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of million in increased million  or  from revenues of million 
during the second half of  several of the company s dredges and ancillary equipment worked on sand berm construction off the coast of louisiana in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
in addition  capital dredging revenues included continued deepening work in the ports of new york  new jersey  and jacksonville 
revenues from beach nourishment projects of million in increased million  or  from million in the amount of beach work won by the company in the second half of significantly exceeded the amount of beach work won by the company in the second half of as the company performs much of its beach work during the first half of each year  when environmental windows are open  the increased backlog at the end of resulted in increased beach revenues 
revenues from maintenance dredging projects in were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in maintenance revenue in was uncharacteristically high because the corps put many delayed projects out to bid 
the company believes that funding of many maintenance projects bid in was augmented by the federal economic stimulus 
the company believes that substantially all of the stimulus funded projects were completed by june  in addition  the number of maintenance projects worked on during the second half of the year declined due to the dredging industry s response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from revenues of million 
foreign revenues started to decline in the second half of as the global recession significantly slowed the rate of infrastructure development in the middle east 
in  the company worked on international projects outside of bahrain  including in the united arab emirates and brazil 

table of contents demolition segment revenues in were million  an increase of million  or  over revenues of million 
this increase was primarily related to improved market conditions in massachusetts and increased activity in new york as well as with respect to bridge demolition  new markets for the demolition segment 
in  demolition revenues were negatively impacted by the slowdown in the us construction industry 
dredging segment gross profit increased to million from million in  and dredging segment gross profit margin dredging gross profit divided by dredging revenue was  up from in the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to increased dredging revenues and dredging project execution that in the aggregate was better than the company s estimates 
demolition segment gross profit increased million from a gross loss of million in to a gross profit of million in and demolition segment gross profit margin was  up from a negative gross profit margin of in  primarily due to improved market conditions which resulted in increased revenues 
while demolition segment gross profit margins have improved in comparison to  they remain lower than pre recession gross profit margins  reflecting continuing competitive pricing pressures 
dredging segment operating income for increased reaching million versus million in  as increased gross profit offset a increase in general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased primarily due to million in costs that were incurred for severance  legal and consulting expenses that were incurred in conjunction with the senior management reorganization 
see note senior management reorganization in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
demolition segment operating loss for decreased million from million in to million in despite improved gross profit  the demolition segment incurred losses with respect to certain projects including a large bridge demolition project  one of the demolition segment s first projects of this type 
in  the demolition segment recorded a loss of million related to this bridge demolition project 
in addition  demolition segment operating results in were negatively impacted by certain projects that had been worked on in and canceled in  resulting in write offs of million 
demolition segment general and administrative expenses for of million increased compared with million in primarily as a result of an increase in bad debt expense and incentive pay 
consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have been generally consistent  ranging between and of revenues over the last three years 
in  general and administrative expenses increased due to additional expenses related to the company s senior management reorganization 
the company s net interest expense for totaled million compared with million in this decrease is due to the lower average outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility during in addition  in the company realized a million gain on its outstanding interest rate swaps compared to a million gain during the company incurred income tax expense of million in compared with million in this million increase is primarily the result of the increase in the company s operating income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the resolution of certain state tax matters 
for the year ended december   net income attributable to great lakes was million compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily driven by higher operating income in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over dredging revenues of million  due to a higher level of dredge employment in in particular  the increase was the result of increased domestic dredging operations that more than offset decreased foreign dredging activity 
dredging gross margin was  up from in  primarily due to increased dredging revenues and project execution that was better than the company s estimates for certain projects  particularly in the first half of the year 
highlights from the company s primary dredging sectors are as follows revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of million in were up million  or  from revenues of million 
this increase was driven by additional capital projects  including deepening work in the ports of new york  new jersey  jacksonville and tampa  florida and three coastal restoration projects in louisiana 
revenues from beach nourishment projects of million in decreased million  or  from million in beach revenues were negatively impacted throughout and the beginning of as state and local governments experienced delays in getting the necessary funding to put projects out to bid 
more beach work was bid and worked in the second half of revenues from maintenance dredging projects in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in this increase was due to the corps continuing to put out maintenance work that had long been delayed 
the company believes that many maintenance projects were supported by the federal economic stimulus funding 
revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from revenues of million 
revenues decreased due to the postponement of a portion of the company s largest foreign project and declining middle eastern demand resulting from the global recession  instability in oil prices and the deterioration of the region s real estate market in and demolition segment revenues in were million  a decrease of million  or  over revenues of million 
as the construction and real estate development market continued to slow in  new project opportunities were scarce 
in addition  a few projects that had been worked on in were canceled in  resulting in write offs related to those projects 
moreover  several large demolition projects were worked on in and were not replaced in as a result  the demolition segment recorded negative gross profit margin of compared to gross profit margin of in dredging segment operating income for increased reaching million versus million in  as strong gross profit performance offset a increase in general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll and incentive costs  legal expenses and other costs related to the company s august secondary offering of stock 
in  the demolition segment produced an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million in due to weaker gross profit performance including write offs related to canceled projects 
demolition segment general and administrative expenses for of million decreased compared with million in primarily as a result of a decrease in incentive pay 
consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have been generally consistent  ranging between and of revenues over the last three years 
the company s net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million in while average debt levels were consistent year over year  lower interest rates decreased interest expense 
the company entered into new interest rate swap agreements in for 
table of contents which the company realized a million gain during the year 
in the company also realized a million gain on its former swap agreements 
the company incurred income tax expense of million compared with million in this million increase is primarily the result of the increase in the company s operating income

bidding activity and backlog the following table sets forth  by segment and type of dredging work  the company s backlog as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  december  backlog dredging capital us capital foreign beach nourishment maintenance rivers lakes total dredging backlog demolition total backlog for comparison purposes  foreign backlog has been decreased by  to reflect the portion of the diyar contract that was reclassified as an option pending award in the first quarter of represents backlog acquired by the company on december  in connection with the matteson acquisition the company s contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
for dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site  the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work 
for demolition contracts  these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the customer 
however  these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government  subject to the company s contractual right to recover the company s actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
in addition  the company s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the company is awarded from the bid market 
a quarterly increase or decrease of the company s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the company s business 
the company s backlog includes only those projects for which the company has obtained a signed contract with the customer 

table of contents approximately of the company s december  backlog is expected to be completed in dredging 
the domestic dredging bid market totaled million  a decline from the domestic dredging bid market of billion 
the bid market was larger than the bid market primarily because the bid market was bolstered by maintenance dredging projects that were funded by the us government economic stimulus package 
in addition  the bid market excludes dredging work related to the construction of sand berms off the coast of louisiana in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
over million of this sand berm construction work was awarded to the company directly by the prime contractor rather than through the customary bidding process 
the company won of the overall domestic bid market compared to of the overall domestic bid market 
the company s five year average win rate is 
this range underscores the variability that can occur in the quarter to quarter and year to year bid results 
the company s december  dredging backlog was million  which includes million attributable to the matteson acquisition 
this represents an increase of million  or  over the company s september  dredging backlog of million  but a decrease of million  or  from the company s december  dredging backlog 
this decrease in the company s annual dredging backlog is primarily the result of the decreased domestic dredging bid market and the company s lower bid win rate 
the company won  or million  of the capital dredging projects awarded in  including a large project in virginia that was awarded in the fourth quarter 
the company s project win rate was adversely affected by the loss of one large capital dredging project  for which the company may ultimately perform work as a subcontractor 
approximately million  or  of the company s december  dredging backlog consists of domestic capital dredging work  a substantial portion of which is expected to be performed in december  capital dredging backlog is less than the prior year because the company worked off most of its backlog related to deepening projects in the ports of new york and new jersey and no large capital projects were added to backlog at year end
