inflation and currency matters china s economy has experienced rapid growth recently 
rapid economic growth could lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation 
if prices for the company s products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the cost of supplies  it may harm the company s profitability 
in order to control inflation in the past  the chinese government has imposed controls on bank credit  limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending 
such policies can lead to a slowing of economic growth 
rises in interest rates by the central bank would likely slow economic activity in china which could  in turn  materially increase the company s costs and also reduce demand for the company s products 
foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  and fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
during  the company supplied products to north america and settled in cash in us dollars 
as a result  appreciation or currency fluctuation of the rmb against the us dollar would increase the cost of export products  and adversely affect the company s financial performance 
in july  the chinese government adjusted its exchange rate policy from fixed rate to floating rate 
during july to december  the exchange rate between rmb and us dollar appreciated from rmb to us to rmb to us 
this significant appreciation of the rmb may continue for in the near term  as the chinese government attempts to slow the rate of inflation in the prc 
significant appreciation of the rmb is likely to decrease the income of export products  thus decreasing the company s cash flow

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
foreign currency risk the company s reporting currency is the us dollar and the majority of its revenues will be settled in rmb and us dollars 
most of the company s assets are denominated in rmb except for cash and accounts receivable 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as its revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb 
the value of the rmb fluctuates and is affected by  among other things  changes in china political and economic conditions 
in addition  the rmb is not readily convertible into us dollars or other foreign currencies 
all foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the bank of china or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rate quoted by the people s bank of china 
the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies such as the us dollar has been generally based on rates set by the people bank of china  which are set daily based on the previous day interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets 
on december  and  the exchange rates of rmb against us dollar were and  respectively 
this floating exchange rate  and any appreciation of the rmb that may result from such rate  could have various adverse effects on the company s business 
the company s currency exchange rate risks come primarily from the sales of products to international customers 
if the rmb appreciates against foreign currencies  it will make the company s sales income decrease 
in order to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk  the company has inserted a currency exchange rate fluctuation compensation provision in its sales contracts with its international customers to the effect that both parties will bear of such loss when the fluctuation is over within that contract year 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable 
the company does not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of its customers are large  well established companies 
the company credit risk is also mitigated because its customers are all selected enterprises supported by the local government 
two customer accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues in  which consisted of chery automobile co  ltd 
and byd automobile co  ltd  which accounted for and  respectively 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to its trade receivables 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
