item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis  particularly with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our proprietary procellex tm protein expression system  or procellex 
using our procellex system  we are developing a pipeline of proprietary and biosimilar or generic versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our plant cell based expression technology that target large  established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action 
our initial commercial focus has been on complex therapeutic proteins  including proteins for the treatment of genetic disorders  such as gaucher disease and fabry disease 
we believe our procellex protein expression system will enable us to develop proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically equivalent or superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications 
because we are primarily targeting biologically equivalent versions of highly active  well tolerated and commercially successful therapeutic proteins  we believe our development process is associated with relatively less risk compared to other biopharmaceutical development processes for completely novel therapeutic proteins 
our lead product development candidate is taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease  which we are developing using our procellex protein expression system 
on december   we filed a new drug application nda for taliglucerase alfa with the fda  and in july we received notification from the fda that it had accepted the filing of our nda and assigned taliglucerase alfa a prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of february  in addition  in november we submitted a marketing application to the israeli moh and an maa to each of the emea and anvisa for taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease 
in addition to our recently completed phase iii clinical trial  we initiated a double blind  follow on extension study as part of the trial during the second quarter of we also initiated a home care treatment program for patients enrolled in the extension study and  in december  we initiated a nine month  worldwide  multi center  open label  switch over clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching gaucher patients currently treated under the current standard of care to treatment with taliglucerase alfa 
in december  we filed a proposed pediatric investigation plan to the pediatric committee of the emea which was approved during the first quarter of  and have since initiated pediatric studies 
on november   protalix ltd 
and pfizer entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement pursuant to which pfizer was granted an exclusive  worldwide license to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  protalix ltd 
retained the right to commercialize taliglucerase alfa in israel 
in connection with the execution of the pfizer agreement  pfizer made an upfront payment to protalix ltd 
of million in connection with the execution of the agreement and subsequently paid protalix ltd 
an additional million upon its filing of a proposed pediatric investigation plan to the pediatric committee of the emea 
protalix ltd 
is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments totaling million for the successful achievement of other regulatory milestones 
pfizer and protalix ltd 
will also share future revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of taliglucerase alfa on a and basis  respectively  and have also agreed to a specific allocation of the responsibilities for the continued development efforts for taliglucerase alfa 
on july   we announced that the french regulatory authority had granted an autorisation temporaire d utilisation atu  or temporary authorization for use  for taliglucerase alfa for the treatment 
table of contents of gaucher disease 
an atu is the regulatory mechanism used by the french health products and safety agency to make non approved drugs available to patients in france when a genuine public health need exists 
this atu allows patients with gaucher disease in france to receive treatment with taliglucerase alfa before marketing authorization for the product is granted in the european union 
payment for taliglucerase alfa has been secured through government allocations to hospitals 
on august   pfizer entered into a million short term supply agreement with the ministry of health of brazil pursuant to which protalix and pfizer have provided taliglucerase alfa to the ministry of health of brazil for the treatment of patients with gaucher disease 
revenue generated from the ministry of health of brazil will be recorded by pfizer and we are entitled to our share of the revenue in accordance with the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement 
in addition  we and the ministry of health of brazil are in discussions relating to a possible long term supply agreement that contemplates  among other matters  providing certain components of our manufacturing technology to the ministry of health of brazil for implementation by it in brazil 
at this time  we are unable to assess whether these discussions will result in an agreement and we can make no assurances that we will be able to enter into such an agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
in any event  we do not expect to enter into a long term supply agreement with the ministry of health of brazil until we receive marketing approval of taliglucerase alfa from the fda or anvisa  if at all 
in addition to taliglucerase alfa  we are developing an innovative product pipeline using our procellex protein expression system 
our product pipeline currently includes  among other candidates  prx  a therapeutic protein candidate for the treatment of fabry disease  a rare  genetic lysosomal disorder in humans  prx  a plant cell expressed pegylated recombinant acetylcholinesterase product candidate for biodefense and other indications  pr antitnf  a plant cell expressed recombinant fusion protein made from the soluble form of the human tnf receptor tnfr and an antibody portion  which is being developed as a treatment of certain immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  juvenile idiopathic arthritis  ankylosing  spondylitis  psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis  an orally administrated glucocerebrosidase enzyme for treating gaucher patients utilizing the oral delivery of the recombinant enzyme produced within carrot cells and additional undisclosed therapeutic proteins  all of which are currently being evaluated in animal studies 
in march  we initiated a preliminary phase i clinical trial of prx  our plant cell expressed pegylated recombinant acetylcholinesterase product candidate for biodefense indications  which we completed in june we are currently preparing for further efficacy trials of this product candidate in larger animals and with live nerve gas 
in december we held a pre ind meeting with the fda with respect to prx we expect to submit an ind to the fda within the next months in connection with an anticipated phase i ii study of prx and to initiate the trial once the ind is approved  if at all 
our business is conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  protalix ltd  which we acquired through a reverse merger transaction effective december  the merger transaction was treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes and  as such  the results of operations discussed below are those of protalix ltd 
prior to the merger transaction  we had not conducted any operations for several years 
protalix ltd 
was originally incorporated in israel in december since its inception in december  protalix ltd 
has generated significant losses in connection with its research and development  including the clinical development of taliglucerase alfa 
since we do not generate significant revenue from any of our product candidates  we expect to continue to generate losses in connection with the continued clinical development of taliglucerase alfa and the research and development activities relating to our technology and other drug candidates 
we except that our expenditures in connection with the research and development activities will continue to represent a significant portion of our expenses for the next several years  and will require further financial resources if the activities are successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses may continue to be substantial over the next several years 
however  if taliglucerase alfa is launched successfully  we anticipate that we will generate revenues to offset any such losses 
we may need to obtain additional funds for the commercialization of our lead product  taliglucerase alfa  and to further develop the research and clinical development of our other programs 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
functional currency the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
as we have no significant source of revenues  we considered the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
most of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
revenues we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  which is when revenue is realized or realizable and earned  there is persuasive evidence a revenue arrangement exists  delivery of goods or services has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue and milestone payments received pursuant to the pfizer agreement in accordance with guidance regarding revenue recognition and accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
pursuant to this guidance  we determine whether our arrangement with pfizer involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting or separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if we determine that there are multiple units of accounting  the consideration from the arrangement is allocated among the separate units based on a relative fair value allocation 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue is recognized over the performance obligation period 
as the arrangement with pfizer requires our continued involvement with respect to the proposed commercialization of taliglucerase alfa  the non refundable  up front license payments we received from pfizer are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimated the performance period of years based on the date that the last relevant patent relating to taliglucerase alfa expires 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we are entitled to of the profits or loss from sales of taliglucerase alfa  and related expenses incurred  except with respect to sales in israel 
we recognize our share of net profit or loss under the pfizer agreement based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms of the pfizer agreement  for its subsidiaries operating outside the united states  financial information is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december we recognize revenues received from the sale of a product to pfizer upon delivery to pfizer 
the revenues represent our cost with respect to the product sold 

table of contents research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the advancement of product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the following table identifies our current major research and development projects project status expected near term milestone taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease nda and maa emea  anvisa and the israeli moh filed pdufa date february  prx alpha gal a preclinical file ind and initiate phase i clinical trials acetylcholinesterase phase i clinical trial additional phase i clinical trials pr antitnf research file ind and initiate phase i clinical trials all of our projects  other than taliglucerase alfa and our acetylcholinesterase product  are in the preclinical or research phase with relatively immaterial costs 
most of our research and development costs were incurred in connection with our phase iii clinical trial of taliglucerase alfa 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across all of our projects 
we currently do not record and maintain research and development costs per project 
the costs and expenses of our projects are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
each grant is deducted from the related research and development expenses as the costs are incurred 
for additional information regarding the grant process  see business israeli government programs encouragement of industrial research and development law  in item of this annual report 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of the product candidates in our pipeline for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
see risk factors all of our product candidates other than taliglucerase alfa and our acetylcholinesterase product are in pre clinical or research stages 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates  our business will be adversely affected and we may not obtain the necessary us or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in a timely manner  if at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we expect our research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and preclinical product development programs for our product candidates other than taliglucerase alfa 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we filed an nda for taliglucerase alfa with the fda in the last quarter of and received a pdufa date of february  in addition  we submitted a marketing application to the israeli moh and an maa to each of the emea and anvisa in the fourth quarter of regarding taliglucerase alfa 
due to the factors set forth above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
see risk factors clinical trials are very expensive  time consuming and difficult to design and implement and may result in unforeseen costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
share based compensation the discussion below regarding share based compensation relates to share based compensation paid by protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
in accordance with the guidance  we record the benefit of any grant to a non employee and remeasure the benefit in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants  as applicable 
in addition  we use the straight line accounting method for recording the benefit of the entire grant  unlike the graded method we use to record grants made to employees 
we measure share based compensation cost for all share based awards at the fair value on the grant date and recognition of share based compensation over the service period for awards that we expect will vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined based on the number of shares granted and the price of our ordinary shares  and calculated based on the black scholes valuation model 
we recognize such value as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the options to purchase common stock granted to employees and non employees during the fiscal year ended december   including shares held by non employees that vested during such period  our management used the fair value of our common stock which was the closing sale price of our common stock on the nyse amex on the date of calculation 
the guidance allows companies to estimate the expected term of the option rather than simply using the contractual term of an option 
because of lack of data on past option exercises by employees  the expected term of the options could not be based on historic exercise patterns 
accordingly  we adopted the simplified method  according to which companies may calculate the expected term as the average between the vesting date and the expiration date  assuming the option was granted as a plain vanilla option 
in performing the valuation  we assumed an expected dividend yield in the previous years and in the next years 
we do not have a dividend policy and given the lack of profitability  dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
the guidance stipulates a number of factors that should be considered when estimating the expected volatility  including the implied volatility of traded options  historical volatility and the period that the shares of the company are being publicly traded 
as we do not have any traded shares or options  the expected volatility figures used in this valuation have been calculated by using the historical volatility of traded shares of similar companies 
in addition  we examined the standard deviation of shares of similar biotechnology companies that engage in research and development  generally with no significant revenues 
we found that the volatility of our shares and the shares of comparable companies was in the range of over periods of three to six years 
the volatility used for each grant differed based on its expected term 
for the term of each grant of our options  the historical volatility was calculated based upon the overall trading history of the common stock of comparable companies 
the risk free interest rate described above has been based on the implied yield of us federal reserve zero coupon government bonds 
the remaining term of the bonds used for each valuation was equal to the 
table of contents expected term of the grant 
this methodology has been applied to all grants valued by us 
the guidance requires the use of a risk free interest rate based on the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed  with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
this requirement has been applied for all grants valued as part of this report 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the amortization of the million of upfront and milestone payments received from pfizer over the entire fiscal year 
such payments were amortized over one month for the year ended december  the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
the amortization during the year ended december  resulted in the recognition of revenue of million  or an increase of million  from  recognized during the year ended december  in addition  we recorded revenues in the amount of approximately million in connection with products delivered to pfizer under our license agreement 
no products were sold during our share in the collaboration agreement we recorded million of income as our share in the collaboration under the pfizer agreement during the year ended december  this income resulted primarily from our share of the approximately million of revenues generated by pfizer s sale of taliglucerase alfa to the ministry of health of brazil under the short term supply agreement during pfizer s fiscal year 
no share in the collaboration was recorded for the year ended december  under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we recorded revenue equal to of the profits realized from sales of taliglucerase alfa  and related expenses incurred based on reports we received from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms of the pfizer agreement  for its subsidiaries operating outside the united states  financial information is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in development expenses related to salaries for personnel involved in research and development  and million in related subcontractors and consultants expenses  mainly in connection with our expanded access program for taliglucerase alfa 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by the recognition of grants from the ocs and pfizer s reimbursement of us  collectively equal to million 
the offsets to our research and development expenses for the year ended december  represent an increase of approximately million  or  compared to the recognition of grants from the ocs equal to million that offset our research and development expenses for the year ended december  we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of preclinical trials for certain of our product candidates and into clinical trials for prx  our product candidate for the treatment of fabry disease  our acetylcholinesterase product candidate and our antitnf product candidate 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or approximately  from million for the year ended december  the decrease 
table of contents resulted primarily from a  decrease in salaries expense during we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add additional personnel and continue to comply with the reporting and other obligations applicable to public companies in the united states 
financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or approximately  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increases in the exchange rate that resulted in income of approximately year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenues of  during the year ended december  the revenue represents the pro rata amortization of the million upfront payment and million milestone payment we received in connection with our license and supply agreement with pfizer 
the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
no revenues were recorded during the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in development expenses related to salaries for personnel involved in research and development  and million in related subcontractors and consultants expenses  mainly in connection with our phase iii clinical trial of taliglucerase alfa 
the increase in research and development expenses was further increased by the recognition of grants equal to million from the ocs during  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to the recognition of grants equal to million during we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of preclinical trials for certain of our product candidates and into additional clinical trials for prx general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of  or approximately  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from a  increase in salaries expenses during financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or approximately  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a lower interest rate for deposits in which contributed to lower financial income during liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate significant product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since our inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds equal to million from the sale of shares of our common stock and from sales of convertible preferred and 
table of contents ordinary shares of protalix ltd  and an additional million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the sale of such ordinary shares  through december  in addition  on october   we generated gross proceeds of million in connection with an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
furthermore  on november   we entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with pfizer  pursuant to which pfizer made an upfront payment to protalix ltd 
of million in connection with the execution of the agreement and subsequently paid to protalix ltd 
an additional million upon meeting a certain milestone 
protalix ltd 
is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to million for the successful achievement of other regulatory related milestones 
we are also entitled to payments equal to of the net profits earned by pfizer on its sales of taliglucerase alfa  if any 
in calculating net profits there are certain agreed upon limits on the amounts that may be deducted from gross sales for certain expenses and costs of goods sold 
we believe that the funds currently available to us as are sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for at least months 
the following table summarizes our past funding sources number of security year shares amount ordinary shares series a convertible preferred shares series b convertible preferred shares series c convertible preferred shares ordinary shares common stock gross proceeds  does not include proceeds from warrant exercises 
includes the issuance of ordinary shares to founders 
during   series b preferred shares were converted on a basis into series c preferred shares for no additional consideration 
also  in connection with such funding  warrants to purchase  series b preferred shares were issued for no additional consideration with an aggregate exercise price of  as of the closing date of the merger   of such warrants were exercised for net proceeds equal to approximately  and  of such warrants were forfeited 
in connection with such funding  warrants to purchase an additional  series c preferred shares were granted to the investors for no additional consideration with a total exercise price equal to million 
as of the closing date of the merger   of such warrants were exercised for net proceeds equal to million   were assumed by our company and  expired 
in connection with such funding  warrants to purchase  ordinary shares were issued for no additional consideration with an aggregate exercise price equal to million 
these warrants were exercised in full on january  cash flows net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  the net loss for of million was further increased by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately million and a decrease of million in deferred revenues 
such net loss was partially offset by non cash charges for share based compensation of million  and depreciation of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was million and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided from financing activities for was approximately  due to option exercises 
net cash provided from operations was million for the year ended december  the net loss for of million was reversed by million received under the license and supply agreement with pfizer 
such reversal was partially offset by non cash charges for share based compensation of million  and depreciation of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was million and consisted 
table of contents primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided from financing activities for was approximately  due to option exercise 
future funding requirements we expect that our operating losses may continue to be substantial over the next several years 
however  we anticipate that we will generate revenues to offset any such losses upon the successful launch of taliglucerase alfa  if at all 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and the advancement of our additional pipeline of product candidate into the various clinical trials 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff  add infrastructure  and incur additional costs related to our preparation for the commercial phase for our lead product candidate  taliglucerase alfa 
in addition  we are working on the expansion of our manufacturing facility that would meet approximately half of the market for our lead product candidate  which would increase our capital expenditures significantly and is estimated to cost approximately million in total 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and the regulatory milestone payments we anticipate receiving from pfizer will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that are subject to change and may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials  costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution and whether these efforts will be performed internally or through some form of collaboration with third parties  the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development  and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue 
we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we currently do not have any commitments for future external funding  other than the potential regulatory related milestone payments from pfizer 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
effects of inflation and currency fluctuations inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or currency fluctuations could affect us by increased or decreased costs mainly for goods and services acquired outside of israel 
we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or

recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method asu 
asu provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance  we may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is achieved  only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years  beginning on or after june   which for our company means the year ending december  early adoption is permitted  however  we have elected to implement asu prospectively  and as a result  the effect of this guidance will be limited to future transactions 
we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as we have no material research and development arrangements which will be accounted for under the milestone method 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers asu 
asu provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufactures and importers on branded prescription drugs which was mandated under the health care reform legislation enacted in the united states in march under this new accounting standard  the annual fee would be presented as a component of operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year such fees are payable using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year 
asu is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially becomes effective  which for our company means the year ending december  as this standard relates only to classification  the adoption of this accounting standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange risk the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
we are currently have no significant source of revenues  therefore we consider the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
approximately of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
since the dollar is the functional currency  monetary items maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and non monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expense items are remeasured at the average rate of exchange in effect during the period in which they occur 
foreign currency translation gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
approximately of our costs  including salaries  expenses and office expenses  are incurred in nis 
inflation in israel may have the effect of increasing the us dollar cost of our operations in israel 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
a revaluation of of the nis will affect our income before tax by less than 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows year ended december  average rate for period rate at year end to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all short term  highly liquid investments  which include short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase  that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  to be cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we invest any cash balances primarily in bank deposits and investment grade interest bearing instruments 
we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
our interest gains may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets
