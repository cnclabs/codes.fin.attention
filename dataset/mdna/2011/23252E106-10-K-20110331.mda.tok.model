item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement for forward looking information statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain forward looking statements 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made below 
these include  but are not limited to  the resolution of litigation involving us  our ability to comply with the terms of our credit facilities  competitive factors  technological and product developments  market demand  and economic conditions 
further information on these and other factors which could affect our financial results can be found in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including part i of this annual report on form k 
overview and outlook we are a new york corporation that develops  manufacturers and markets high performance  professional quality exercise equipment products for the commercial market and  to a lesser extent  the premium segment of the consumer market 
we estimate that commercial sales represent more than of our total net sales 
our financial performance can be affected when  in times of economic uncertainty  our commercial customers  particularly fitness clubs  become cautious in making expansion and other capital investments and reduce their expenditures for items such as the fitness equipment offered by us 
our net sales began to decline commencing with the fourth quarter of  with net sales in and approximately and  respectively  below net sales 
we believe that this sales decline largely reflects our commercial customers  particularly fitness clubs  being cautious in making capital investments due to economic conditions  both generally and in the fitness industry 
our sales began to recover in  with net sales approximately above net sales 
this improvement in sales accelerated throughout the year  with sales in the second and third quarters of essentially flat compared to net sales for the corresponding periods and fourth quarter net sales almost above fourth quarter results 
while we believe that this trend may reflect improving economic and industry conditions as well as our marketing and new product initiatives  there is no assurance that the improved sales trend will continue 
we also cannot be certain the extent that other factors  such as the product liability verdict discussed below or changes in economic conditions  will affect our financial performance 
we took various steps to reduce expenses in response to the decline in our sales 
these steps included a first quarter work force reduction of about and a wage reduction of or for all employees in effect from the second quarter to december  in addition  at the request of our outside board members  a reduction in director fees was in effect during the period of the employee wage reduction 
we intend to monitor general economic conditions and our sales performance and  if warranted  may implement further cost saving measures 
on december   the jury in the barnhard product liability suit returned a million verdict  apportioned to cybex  to a non affiliated co defendant  and to the plaintiff 
under new york law  cybex would be responsible for payment of of any judgment entered on this verdict and may then seek to collect of such judgment from the co defendant 
our available insurance coverage for this matter as of december  was approximately  see item  part of this report and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a more detailed description of this matter 
we intend to vigorously pursue all available options to seek a reversal or reduction of the verdict and any judgment that is ultimately entered on the verdict  and we will seek a stay of enforcement of any judgment during the appellate process 
such a stay may require the posting of a bond in a substantial amount  up to the full amount of the judgment 
while we will ask the court to issue such a stay with a limited or no bonding requirement  there is no assurance we will be successful in this regard or that we will have the financial ability to secure a bond at a level required by the court 
the requirement to post a bond in a significant amount  even if at a level within our capacity to secure  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and business prospects 
if we are unable to obtain a required bond  the plaintiff would be able to immediately enforce the judgment before we are able to fully pursue our appeal 
we do not have the capital resources or liquidity to satisfy our obligations if the plaintiff is ultimately able  either due to our inability to post a bond or the failure of our appeal  to enforce a judgment in this matter that has not been substantially reduced from the jury verdict 
the report of our independent registered public accountants on our consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the barnhard jury verdict raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements that are included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we believe that we were not at fault in the accident that is the basis of the plaintiff s claims and accordingly that this case was wrongly decided as to liability 
in addition  we believe that the amount of damages awarded by the jury is grossly overstated 
our strategy to resolve the doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern is to vigorously contest the outcome of the barnhard jury verdict through post trial proceedings and appeal  in order to obtain a reversal or substantial reduction of the award 
the foregoing statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
in particular  the uncertainties created by the jury verdict discussed above  and the continued uncertainties in us and global economic conditions and in the fitness industry  make it particularly difficult to predict future events and may preclude us from achieving expected results 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses litigation charge goodwill impairment charge operating loss interest expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss net sales our net sales increased  or  to  in compared with a  or  decrease in compared to the increase in was attributable to increases in sales of cardiovascular products of  or to  and increased freight  parts and other sales of  or to  offset by decreases in sales of strength products of  or to  we believe that the overall increase in sales is reflective of improving economic conditions as well as our marketing and new product initiatives 
the decrease in was attributable to decreases in sales of cardiovascular products of  or to  strength training products of  or to  and freight  parts and other sales of  or to  the sales decline was generally throughout our product offerings and we believe was reflective of economic conditions  generally and in the fitness industry 
sales outside of north america represented  and of consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin was in  compared with in and in margins increased in due to higher selling prices  favorable product mix  lower warranty costs  lower component costs  lower obsolescence expense 
and lower manufacturing costs 
margins decreased in due to higher material costs as a percentage of sales due primarily to higher steel costs and product and customer mix  higher warranty costs  and higher overhead as a percentage of sales mainly due to lower volumes 
these decreases in margin were partially offset by lower labor costs as a percentage of sales and improvements in freight billings compared to freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including bad debt expense  increased by  or in to  compared to a decrease of  or  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was predominantly due to higher sales and marketing costs  including initiatives directed to new markets  higher sales compensation and advertising costs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was predominantly due to a decrease in domestic and international selling expenses  and a decrease in product development costs  and was the result of various cost reductions we effectuated during in response to economic conditions 
litigation charge the litigation charge for the year ended december  relates to an unfavorable jury verdict in the barnhard product liability suit 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment charge at december   we tested our goodwill for impairment and performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation by comparing the fair market value of our single reporting unit  as determined using market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  to its carrying value 
as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of the impairment evaluation was performed to calculate impairment  and as a result a goodwill impairment charge of  the entire amount of the goodwill carrying value  was recorded effective december   with no corresponding tax benefit 
the primary reason for the impairment charge was the reduction in our market capitalization resulting from the sustained decline of our stock price during the second half of interest expense  net net interest expense decreased by  or  in to  compared to an increase of  or  in during  interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates on the new equipment facility offset by higher interest earned in from a financing program 
during  interest expense increased due to a higher applicable interest rate resulting from debt modifications  offset by lower average borrowings 
income taxes we recorded  as of december   an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  to fully offset our deferred tax assets of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent it cannot be determined that the realization of these assets is more likely than not 
due to the uncertainty created by an unfavorable product liability jury verdict see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  we determined that a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax assets as of december  is necessary 
we recorded an income tax expense benefit of  including the increase in the valuation allowance   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the effective tax benefit rate was in excluding the litigation charge and related tax expense  in and in before the non deductible goodwill impairment charge 
the tax benefit rates in each year are affected by non deductible foreign losses  and the percentage that these losses represent of our results for the year causes large fluctuations in our tax benefit rates 
actual cash outlays for taxes continue to be reduced by the available operating loss carryforwards and credits 
as of december   us federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately  were available to us to offset future taxable income and  as of such date  we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of  federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had negative working capital of  compared to positive working capital of  at december  the net decrease in working capital is primarily due to the net liability accrued for the non cash barnhard litigation charge of  as well as the use of cash for capital expenditures and the reduction of long term debt  partially offset by the net cash provided by operating activities in for the year ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories in compared to decreases in  partially offset by net income excluding the litigation charge and related tax expense generated in compared to a net loss in cash used in investing activities of  in consisted of purchases of manufacturing tooling and equipment of  primarily for the manufacture of new products  and computer hardware and infrastructure of  cash used in investing activities of  during consisted of purchases of manufacturing tooling and equipment of  primarily for the manufacture of new products  and computer hardware and infrastructure of  while capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  the timing and amount of these expenditures will depend on economic conditions  the results of our operations and our other cash needs 
for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities of  consisted primarily of  in repayment of the wells fargo bank  na wells fargo term loans and  of principal payments on the citizens real estate loan  offset by  advanced under the citizens equipment facility 
for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities of  consisted primarily of net term loan payments of  and  for the purchase of treasury stock through a repurchase program 
we have credit facilities with rbs citizens  national association and rbs asset finance  inc collectively  citizens 
our citizens credit agreement provides a revolving line of credit of up to the lesser of a ceiling or an amount determined by reference to a borrowing base 
our citizens loan agreement provided for a  real estate loan which was advanced in to finance the acquisition of our owatonna facility 
our citizens equipment facility has provided  of equipment lease financing  the proceeds of which were used in june to retire equipment term loans and related obligations to wells fargo 
the citizens real estate loan and revolving line of credit are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the citizens equipment facility is secured by our equipment  is cross collateralized by our accounts receivable and inventory and matures on july  the citizens real estate loan matures on july  the citizens revolving line of credit matures july  while there can be no assurance  we anticipate that the line will either be extended or replaced prior to that date 
at december   there were no outstanding revolving credit loans  a  real estate loan and  outstanding under the citizens equipment facility 
availability under the revolving loan fluctuates daily 
at the date of this report  the availability under the revolving line of credit is  our credit facilities include financial covenants 
these financial covenants were amended in march  permitting us to remain in compliance with them as of december  we believe that we will remain in compliance with our financing agreements throughout  provided that there is a stay of execution of any judgment issued on the barnhard verdict which continues throughout the period 
while there can be no assurance  we do not believe it is probable that the judgment will be enforced without a stay of execution pending our appeals  or that we will be required to post a bond in excess of an amount acceptable to the bank  which would constitute events of default  during at least calendar we rely upon cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
as discussed above under the caption overview and outlook  the barnhard jury verdict creates uncertainties as to whether our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our obligations 
in addition to these uncertainties  a decline in sales or margins or a failure to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facilities or to extend the maturity date of our revolving line of credit could result in having insufficient funds for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
however  we believe that our cash flows and the availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund our general working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months  provided that there is a stay of enforcement of any judgment issued on the barnhard verdict which continues throughout the period 
as of december   we had approximately  in us federal and non us net operating loss carry forwards  substantially all of which will be available to offset future taxable income 
these losses do not include the charge relating to the unfavorable jury verdict in the barnhard matter  as it is not currently deductible for income taxes

this presentation is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and the tables include a reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results 
we believe that the non gaap statement of operations data is a beneficial supplemental disclosure in analyzing and assessing our operating performance  exclusive of the effects of the litigation charge and related increase in valuation allowance  and to provide a basis for reviewing our operating performance on a consistent basis for the periods presented 
we also believe that the non gaap balance sheet data is beneficial supplemental disclosure in analyzing and assessing changes in our financial condition  exclusive of the effects of the litigation charge and related tax impact

cybex international  inc matter described in item  legal proceedings 
at the date of this report  no judgment has been entered on the verdict 
the company intends to vigorously pursue all available options to seek a reversal or reduction of the verdict and any judgment that is ultimately entered 
we have agreements with our named executive officers that provide for severance payments to the officer in the event the employee is terminated without cause or  in certain situations  the officer resigns after a change in control 
as further described in note  employment agreements  to the company s consolidated financial statements  the maximum cash exposure under these agreements is  as of december  the actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the executive officer s separation from the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have a lease financing program  whereby we arrange equipment leases and other financing for certain commercial customers for selected products 
these leases are sales type leases and are generally for terms of three to five years  at which time title transfers to the lessee 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guaranty or other recourse provisions 
at december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately  a reserve for estimated losses under recourse provisions of  has been recorded based upon historical experience  and is included in accrued liabilities at december  recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance addressing revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this new guidance establishes a new hierarchy for allocating revenues among multiple deliverables in a multi element arrangement 
in order of preference  revenues will be allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence  or estimated selling price 
additional disclosures are required to describe the effects of adoption  including changes in how arrangement consideration is allocated or in the pattern and timing of revenue recognition 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and the company elected to early adopt for new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after january  the adoption did not materially impact the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued guidance to require new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and activity in level fair value measurements 
additionally  this guidance clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted this guidance on january  and included the appropriate disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserves for warranty obligations  reserves for legal matters and product liability  and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
all products are warranted for one year of labor and up to ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to ten years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from management s estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company will record a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no loss is recorded 
as additional information becomes available  the company will continue to assess whether losses from legal matters are probable  possible  or remote  and the adequacy of accruals for probable loss contingencies 
product liability reserve 
due to the nature of its products  the company is involved in certain pending product liability claims and lawsuits 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage subject to deductibles 
reserves for self insured retention  including claims incurred but not yet reported  are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  based on management s review of outstanding claims and claims history and consultation with its third party claims administrators 
the company records a reserve for the self insured retention portion of product liability matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of the loss can be determined 
the company records a reserve and a corresponding insurance receivable if the amount of the product liability exposure is recoverable from the company s insurance carrier 
if actual results vary from management s estimates  adjustments to the reserve would be required 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion on product liability 
the company  as of december   recorded a  litigation reserve as a current liability pertaining to the barnhard jury verdict and a corresponding litigation related receivable of  representing the amount recoverable from the co defendant in the matter and the estimated amount recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
the company also accrued  and  as of december  and  respectively  for product liability claims and a corresponding receivable for the liability claims estimated to be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
this product liability claims accrual is included as a component of other liabilities and the insurance recoverable is included as a component of other assets at december  and december  on a quarterly basis  the company reviews and adjusts each product liability claim and corresponding receivable 
the change in accrual for product liability claims and the corresponding receivable from december  to december  primarily relates to the insured settlement of a product liability claim during the first quarter of valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
at december   there is a valuation allowance of  which reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
approximately  of future taxable income is needed to fully recognize the company s deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions relating to the likely utilization of the deferred tax asset change in the future  the valuation allowance may change accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes and also to reduce volatility of its financing costs 
under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on agreed notational principal amounts 
these agreements are considered highly effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of the company s variable debt  and hedge accounting is used to account for these instruments 
the company has an interest rate swap which effectively converts the citizens real estate loan in the amount of  at december  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of to based on a performance grid throughout the duration of the loan 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these instruments 
a change in interest rates would not materially impact the company s interest expense because the interest rate swap effectively converts the majority of the company s outstanding debt to fixed rate debt 
foreign currency rates the company at times uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on sales made in the uk in british sterling 
there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  foreign currency fluctuations do not have a significant impact on the business because most purchases and sales are denominated in us dollars
