background and overview we design  develop  market and support high performance  object oriented database management software solutions and provide related maintenance and professional services 
our products and services address the complex data management needs of enterprises and providers of products requiring data management functions 
our products and services collectively comprise our single operating segment  which we call data management 
our end user customers typically use our products to manage data for business systems and to enable these systems to access and integrate data necessary for the customers data management applications 
our data management products and services offer customers the ability to manage real time  xml and other types of hierarchical and navigational data 
we believe that by using our data management solutions  customers cut their hardware costs  accelerate and simplify their development efforts  significantly reduce administration costs and deliver products and services with a significant competitive edge 
our data management business is currently comprised of the following key products versant object database or vod  previously known as vds  an eighth generation object oriented database management system that is used in high performance  large scale  real time commercial applications in distributed computing environments 
we also offer several optional ancillary products for use with versant object database to extend its capabilities  provide compatibility and additional protection of stored data 
fastobjects  an object oriented database management system that can be embedded as a high performance component into customers applications and systems 

table of contents dbo  an open source object oriented database software solution targeting the embedded device market 
our versant object database product offerings are used primarily by larger organizations  such as technology providers  telecommunications carriers  government defense agencies  defense contractors  healthcare companies and companies in the financial services and transportation industries  each of which have significant large scale data management requirements 
with the incorporation of the fastobjects solution into our product line following our march merger with poet holdings  inc  we expanded the scope of our solutions to also address the data management needs of smaller business systems 
by our recent acquisition of dbo in december  we further expanded the scope of our solutions to include the embedded device market 
our customers data management needs can involve many business functions  ranging from management of the use and sharing of a company internal enterprise data to the processing of externally originated information such as customer enrollment  billing and payment transaction data 
our solutions have also been used to solve complex data management issues such as fraud detection  risk analysis and yield management and can be adapted for use with many different applications 
in addition to our product offerings  we provide maintenance and technical support services to assist users in using our products 
we also offer a variety of consulting and training services to assist users in developing and deploying applications based on versant object database  fastobjects and dbo 
we license our products and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
in addition to these products and services  we resell related software developed by third parties 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from the following data management products and related services sales of licenses for versant object database and fastobjects  maintenance and technical support services for our products  including dbo  consulting and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with versant object database  the resale of licenses  and maintenance  training and consulting services for third party products that complement versant object database  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  which we incurred and are recorded as revenues in our statements of income 
continued adverse global economic conditions are negatively impacting our business the united states and global economies and financial markets have experienced a prolonged downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions  slower economic activity  the more recent crises relating to concerns about the debt and financial stability of certain european countries  concerns about failures or the instability of major financial institutions and other businesses  inflation and deflation  high rates of unemployment  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions  liquidity concerns and other factors 
the severity of these economic and financial market conditions and the length of time they may persist are unknown 

table of contents our business has been negatively affected by these ongoing worldwide economic conditions 
it is unclear when or to what extent the macroeconomic environment may improve 
during fiscal  our selling environment remained very challenging  causing customers to delay or reduce technology purchases or to make smaller investments in our solutions and services 
we are seeing continuing pressures on our customers budgets  and as they are facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  some of our customers are deferring purchases of our products 
the current difficult and uncertain economic conditions are causing some of our customers to face financial challenges and they may continue to face such challenges for the foreseeable future 
the current economic downturn in our customers industries has contributed to the substantial reduction in both our license and maintenance revenues and could continue to harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
financial highlights for fiscal our net revenues in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from net revenues of million in fiscal this decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases in maintenance revenues related to fewer back maintenance transactions and customers choosing less expensive support options and to a lesser extent  fewer license transactions and the relative absence of larger license transactions 
in fiscal  our license revenues were negatively impacted by the weakened global economy 
one customer accounted for of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended october  we depend heavily on our installed customer base for future revenues from maintenance renewal fees 
our net income for fiscal was million compared to a net income of million in fiscal the decrease in net income in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in our revenues and an increase in the provision for income taxes  partially offset by modest decreases in our cost of revenues and operating costs 
the increase in the provision for income taxes resulted primarily from an adjustment to the company deferred tax assets in fiscal that was not repeated in fiscal our combined sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative and restructuring expenses were million in fiscal  representing a decrease of  or from million of such expenses reported in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in our general and administrative expenses  a  decrease in our research and development expenses and a  decrease in restructuring expense  partially offset by a  increase in our sales and marketing expenses during fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to an approximate million reduction in operating income and a  increase in trade accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to our acquisition of the dbo assets for approximately million in cash in fiscal  and  in cash in fiscal cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal when compared to fiscal was due to an increase of approximately million we used to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase programs  together with a decrease of  in the proceeds we received from issuance of common stock 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by million to million at october  compared to million at october  
table of contents fiscal and beyond during fiscal  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on our data management products  versant object database  fastobjects and dbo and on related maintenance  consulting and training services 
versant object database was the key focus of our marketing efforts and the major source of our license and service revenues in fiscal we again expect to derive most of our revenues in fiscal from versant object database  fastobjects and dbo licenses and related services 
on december  we acquired the assets of the database software business of privately held servo software  inc formerly dbobjects  inc for million in cash 
dbo is an open source object database software solution targeting the embedded device market 
it is distributed under free open source licenses to a large  open source community of approximately  registered members located around the world  and in some cases is licensed on a fee bearing basis to certain customers for redistribution 
like many other software companies  we do not operate with a significant backlog of orders 
our license revenues  in particular  are difficult to forecast 
the outlook into the company anticipated performance in fiscal is uncertain  due principally to the prolonged worldwide recession and economic instability 
in addition  versant has plans to increase its sales and marketing spending levels by approximately in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company expects to recognize benefits from these additional sales and marketing expenditures over the medium term  and currently expects its total revenues in fiscal year to increase modestly from the fiscal year total revenues of million 
due to the projected increased spending in sales and marketing  the company is currently projecting income from operations to remain relatively stable for fiscal year without limitation  the estimates  forecasts and other statements in this paragraph are forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period covered by our financial statements 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends  industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that such estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding many future variables and uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  as set forth in accounting standards codification asc  software  revenue recognition  formerly known as and comprised of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop and modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  asc  revenue recognition  construction type and production type contracts  formerly known as sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 

table of contents our revenues consist mainly of revenues earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements otherwise known as post contract customer support or pcs and  to a lesser degree  agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered by us at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenues based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements of a transaction  we defer all revenues from that transaction until sufficient evidence of the fair value exists or until all elements have been delivered 
under the residual method  discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  with any undelivered elements being deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
we typically do not offer discounts on future undeveloped products 
we have established vsoe of fair value of our pcs as evidenced by stand alone renewal transactions using the bell shaped curve approach 
pcs of our versant object database is priced as a percentage of the original software license fees 
we perform quarterly analysis on a transaction by transaction basis to document the range of pricing in pcs renewals 
we conclude that we have established vsoe of fair value for our pcs  if substantial majorities greater than of our stand alone renewal transactions are priced within a reasonably narrow range plus or minus from the midpoint of the range 
for the year ended october   the pricing of over of our stand alone pcs renewal transactions fell within the predefined pricing range 
revenues from software license arrangements  including prepaid license fees  are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred and there are no future deliverables except pcs 
the fee is fixed and determinable 
if we cannot conclude that a fee is fixed and determinable  then assuming all other criteria have been met  we recognize the revenues as payments become due in accordance with asc collection is reasonably assured 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenues are not recognized until customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or until satisfaction of the contingency  as applicable 
our license fees are generally non cancelable and non refundable 
also  our customer agreements for prepaid deployment licenses typically do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of the software 
therefore  a customer delay or acceleration in its deployment schedule generally does not impact our revenue recognition in the case of a prepaid deployment license 
revenues from related pcs for all product lines are usually billed in advance of the service being provided and are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term in which the pcs is to be performed  which is generally twelve months 
in some cases pcs revenues are paid in arrears of the service being provided and are recognized as revenues at the time the customer provides a report to us for deployments made during a given time period 
training and consulting revenues are recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
we categorize our customers into two broad groups  end users and value added resellers vars 
end user customers are companies who use our products internally and do not redistribute 
table of contents our product outside of their corporate organizations 
var customers include traditional value added resellers  systems integrators  original equipment manufacturers oems and other vendors who redistribute our products to their external third party customers  either separately or as part of an integrated product 
we license our data management products through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop and test an application program that uses our software product 
before an end user customer may deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses in which the license fees are based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our product  or for certain applications  are based on the number of users 
pricing of versant object database and fastobjects licenses varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application runs and the number of users that are able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment to us of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
vars and distributors purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis on terms similar to those of development licenses that we sell directly to end users 
vars are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of our data management products that are either bundled or embedded in the var applications and sold directly to end users 
vars are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is either based on the number of copies of the application software that are distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the vars to their end user customers 
these royalties from vars may be prepaid in full or paid upon deployment 
our var agreements for prepaid royalty arrangements are non cancelable  non refundable and do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of our software  and therefore  the future deployment schedules of our vars have no impact on revenue recognition 
provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  revenues from arrangements with vars are recognized  i as to prepaid license arrangements  when the prepaid licenses are sold to the var  and ii as to other license arrangements  at the time the var provides a royalty report to us for sales made by the var during a given period 
revenues from our resale of third party products or services are recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in the cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions by assuming the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenues from the resale of third party products or services are recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
on occasion  at a customer request  we perform engineering work to port our products to an unsupported platform  to customize our software for specific functionality  or to perform other non routine technical assignments for a customer 
in these instances  we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  construction type and production type contracts  and use either the time and material percentage of completion method or the completed contract method for recognizing revenues 
we use the percentage of completion method if we can make reasonable and dependable estimates of labor costs and hours required to complete the work in question 
we periodically review these estimates in connection with the work performed and rates actually charged and recognize any losses when identified 
progress to completion is determined using the cost to cost method  whereby cost incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost determines the percentage completed and 
table of contents revenue recognized 
when using the percentage of completion method  the following conditions must exist an agreement must include provisions that clearly specify the rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by both parties  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
the customer is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
versant is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the completed contract method is used when reasonable or dependable estimates of labor costs and time to complete the work cannot be made 
as a result  in such situations  we defer all revenues until such time as the work is fully completed 
management makes significant judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the revenue we recognize in each accounting period 
if we had made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized would have resulted 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with asc  business combinations  and allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we test for any goodwill impairment within our single data management operating segment and reporting unit 
all our goodwill reflected in the financial statements included in this report has been aggregated from  and acquired in connection with  the following acquisitions versant europe  acquired in  poet holdings  inc  acquired in march  technology of jdo genie pty ltd  acquired in june  fastobjects  inc  acquired in july  and dbo  acquired in december financial accounting standards board fasb guidance requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events 
we use the market approach to assess the fair value of our assets and this value is compared with the carrying value of those assets to test for impairment 
the total fair value of our assets is estimated by summing the fair value of our equity as indicated by versant publicly traded share price and shares outstanding plus an estimated control premium less our liabilities 
under this approach  if the estimated fair value of our assets is greater than their carrying value  then there is no goodwill impairment 
if the estimated fair value of our assets is less than their carrying value  then we allocate the reporting unit estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities as though the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill allocable to the reporting unit is less than that reporting unit goodwill carrying amount and would be recorded in operating results during the period of such impairment 
identifiable intangibles are currently amortized using the straight line method over five years in relation to the jdo genie pty ltd acquisition  six years in relation to the fastobjects  inc 
table of contents acquisition  seven years in relation to our acquisition of poet  nine years in relation to the acquisition of the dbo customer relationships  and five years for other dbo related acquired intangible assets 
we performed our annual valuation and analysis of goodwill in october  october and october we did not perform impairment tests related to our intangible assets during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  as there were no triggering events which might indicate impairment 
as a result  we determined that the value of our goodwill and intangible assets had been fairly recorded in our financial statements  and therefore no impairment charges were recorded against our goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method provided by asc  income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we assess the likelihood that  and the extent to which  our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
if we establish or release a valuation allowance then we must increase or decrease the tax provision in our statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based upon our operating results in recent years and through october  as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of a portion of our net deferred tax assets in germany to the extent of our expected taxable income for fiscal due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the balance of our deferred tax assets  we have maintained a valuation allowance at october  of million 
as of october   we had a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets 
as required by asc  income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we are subject to us federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the us as well as in foreign jurisdictions 
tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before with respect to prior tax years no longer subject to examination due to expiration of the statute of limitations  income may nevertheless be recomputed for the purpose of determining the amount of nol that may be carried over to open years 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes for all periods presented  which were not significant

fluctuations in our total revenues can be attributed to changes in economic and industry conditions  product and customer mix  general trends in information technology 
table of contents spending  changes in geographic mix  and the corresponding impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
further  product life cycles impact revenues periodically as old contracts expire and new products are released

see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding this transaction 
our total revenues decreased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of million or in maintenance revenues and from a decrease of  or in license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in maintenance revenues in fiscal was principally due to fewer back maintenance transactions and customers choosing less expensive support options 
we believe the principal factors that caused our license revenues to decrease in fiscal included adverse global economic conditions  smaller license transactions and fewer license transactions 
our total revenues decreased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of million or in license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in total revenues also included approximately million resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which comprised of the million decrease in total revenues 
we believe factors that caused our license revenues to decrease in fiscal included the adverse global economic conditions  the relative absence of larger license transactions  fewer license transactions and the stronger us dollar as compared to the euro in fiscal  which resulted in lower consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal maintenance revenues remained relatively stable in fiscal over fiscal  decreasing by  or 
in fiscal year  one customer accounted for of our total revenues for the fiscal year 
two different customers accounted for and of our total revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter of no one customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal and for the quarters ended october  and october  the inherently unpredictable business cycle of an enterprise software company makes discernment of continued and meaningful business trends difficult 
in terms of license revenues  we are still experiencing lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis where payment is tied to actual usage or deployment of our software  versus the older historical practice of prepaying license fees in advance of usage  a factor which can adversely affect the amount of our license revenues 
license revenues also are a critical factor in driving the amount of our services revenues  as new license customers typically enter into support and maintenance agreements with us  from which our maintenance revenues are derived over future fiscal periods 
the outlook into the company anticipated performance in fiscal is uncertain  due principally to the significant worldwide economic slowdown 
we are currently expecting our total revenues for fiscal to increase approximately from fiscal

license revenues were million or of total revenues for fiscal  a decrease of approximately  or from million or of total revenues reported for fiscal the reduced license revenues in absolute dollars for fiscal were mainly attributable to fewer and smaller license transactions 
the decrease in license revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal included unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately  the majority of our license revenues in fiscal continued to be transactions with existing var customers in the telecommunications industry  which was our largest vertical market in fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance and technical support revenues include revenues derived from maintenance agreements  under which we provide customers with internet and telephone access to support personnel and software upgrades  dedicated technical assistance and emergency response support options 
maintenance revenues were million or of total revenues for fiscal  a decrease of million or from million or of total revenues reported for fiscal the decrease in maintenance revenues for fiscal was partially due to an approximate decrease of  in recognized back maintenance compared to fiscal and an approximate decrease of  resulting from certain customers electing less expensive support and maintenance options in fiscal the decrease in maintenance revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal included unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately  professional services revenues professional services revenues consist of revenues from consulting  training and technical support  as well as billable travel expenses incurred by our professional services organization 
professional services revenues were  or of total revenues in fiscal  a decrease of  or from  or of total revenues reported in fiscal this decrease in the absolute dollar amount of professional services revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to decreases in consulting and training revenues in both the us and the european

revenues from north america the  or decrease in revenues from north america in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of  in maintenance revenues and a decrease of  in license revenues 
north american maintenance revenues declined from fiscal to fiscal as customers chose less expensive support options or maintained fewer licenses 
north american license revenues decreased due to fewer license transactions and the approximate  decrease to license revenues resulting from one customer previous misreporting and overpayment of royalties to versant 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding this transaction 
revenues from europe the million or decrease in revenues from europe in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in european maintenance revenues and to a lesser extent  a  decrease in european license revenues 
the decrease in european maintenance revenues from fiscal to fiscal included an approximate  decrease in back maintenance transactions and an approximate  decrease as a result of customers choosing less expensive support options 
the decrease in european license revenues from fiscal to fiscal reflected fewer license transactions in europe and the relative absence of larger license transactions 
the decrease in total revenues from europe also included approximately  resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the company acquisition of poet holdings  inc in early  we have generally derived a higher percentage of international revenues due to stronger demand for our products in europe 
we expect in the future to continue to experience a somewhat stronger demand for our products in europe as compared to our other geographic markets 
revenues from asia we experienced an increase of  or in revenues from our asia pacific region during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased revenues from our distributor in japan 
a variety of factors may impact versant future revenues  including the potential strengthening of the us dollar which would have the effect of reducing portions of our revenue resulting from favorable currency exchange fluctuations and the generally difficult economic environment currently being experienced in the global economy  which may negatively impact demand for our products and services 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in total revenues occurred across geographic regions as the global economy slowed

we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis during fiscal 
table of contents our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in euros  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the euro though in the future the same could be true of other foreign currencies depending on the source of our revenues 
this exposure has the potential to produce fluctuations within our consolidated results 
however  in some instances our european operations act as a natural hedge  since both operating expenses as well as revenues are denominated in local currencies 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  our european operating expenditures will be lower as well 
additionally  we held approximately of our total cash balances at october  in the form of us dollars to assist in neutralizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations

taking into consideration the cash outflows related to potential common stock repurchases and with our current and estimated revenues  collections and cost structure  we expect to operate with a moderate negative cash flow in fiscal cash flows from operating activities the main source of our operating cash flows is cash collections from customers who have purchased our products and services 
our primary uses of cash in operating activities are payments for personnel related expenditures and facilities costs 

table of contents fiscal we generated million of cash flows from operations in fiscal this amount resulted from million in net income  adjusted for non cash charges of million and partially offset by a million increase in operating assets net of liabilities since the beginning of fiscal the increase in operating assets net of liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of  in trade accounts receivable 
non cash adjustments were approximately million  as reflected in our cash flow statement in fiscal  which were primarily share based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization expense of  non cash adjustments may increase or decrease in the future and  as a result  this might positively or negatively impact our future operating results  but they will not have a direct impact on our cash flows 
the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and collections from our customers for accounts receivable will impact our cash flows from operating activities 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
our standard payment terms for our invoices are usually between and days net 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of our accounts receivable and our days sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso by taking the ending accounts receivable balances net of bad debt allowance divided by the average daily sales amount 
average daily sales amount is calculated by dividing the total quarterly revenue recognized net of changes in deferred revenues by days 
collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in future periods  due to the timing and amount of our revenues and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our dsos were days  days and days for the three months ended october   october  and october   respectively 
fiscal we generated million of cash flows from operations in fiscal this was primarily derived from million in net income  adjusted for non cash charges of  non cash adjustments were approximately  as reflected in our cash flow statement in fiscal  which were primarily share based compensation expense of  depreciation and amortization expense of  and restructuring charges of  partially offset by the deferred income tax benefit of  our working capital was million as of october  compared to million as of october  fiscal we generated million of cash flows from operations in fiscal this was primarily derived from million in net income offset by a  reduction in accounts payables and other liabilities

our cash used in investing activities also reflects our acquisition of dbo for  and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we anticipate a moderate decrease in our overall spending related to property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from financing activities our primary use of cash in financing activities has been the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by cash proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
purchases of our common stock were approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
no stock repurchases were made in fiscal proceeds from issuance of our common stock were approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our future liquidity and capital resources could be impacted by the exercise of outstanding common stock options and the cash proceeds we receive upon exercise of these securities 
as of october  we had approximately  shares available to issue under our current equity incentive and director plans 
the timing of the issuance of options under these plans  the duration and timing of their vesting schedules and their grant price will all impact the timing of any exercises and proceeds 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the amount of such proceeds at this time 
on november  versant board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock in fiscal year the stock repurchase program is currently scheduled to expire upon the earlier of october   or such time as versant has expended million to repurchase outstanding common shares under the program  however the program may be suspended  discontinued  terminated or extended at any time by the company 
we currently do not anticipate establishing a credit or loan facility in fiscal commitments and contingencies our principal commitments as of october  consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and equipment 
in september  the company entered into an amended lease agreement to extend the office facilities lease for its us headquarters and in july  the company entered into a new lease agreement for its european headquarters 
on november  versant board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock in fiscal year the stock repurchase program is currently scheduled to expire upon the earlier of october   or such time as versant has expended million to repurchase outstanding common shares under the program  however the program may be suspended  discontinued  terminated or extended at any time by the company 
any repurchases made under the stock repurchase program are expected to be funded from the company working capital 
after taking into account potential common stock repurchases under our current stock repurchase program  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash forecast from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations during the next twelve months
