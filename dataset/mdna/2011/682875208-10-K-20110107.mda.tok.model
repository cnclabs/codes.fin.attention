recent developments a for reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock was effective on april  except as otherwise indicated  all related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and in this k  including common share quantities  convertible debenture conversion prices and exercise prices of options and warrants  have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split 
on september   we entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with lincoln park capital fund  llc lpc  whereby lpc agreed to an initial purchase of  shares of our common stock and  shares of our series a preferred stock series a  together with warrants to purchase  of our common shares 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  lpc also received  shares of our common stock as a one time commitment fee and a cash payment of  as a one time structuring fee 
on september   we received net proceeds of  from lpc in exchange for our issuance of the above shares and warrants 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  lpc also committed to purchase  at our sole discretion  up to an additional  shares of our common stock in installments over the term of the purchase agreement  generally at prevailing market prices  but subject to the specific restrictions and conditions in the purchase agreement 
during the period from october  through january  lpc purchased an additional  shares of our common stock under that purchase agreement for net proceeds of approximately  from january through may we borrowed an aggregate of million from four individual investors under the terms of unsecured subordinated convertible notes 
although the remaining principal balance of these notes was  as of september    of this balance was satisfied by us on october  by the payment of cash and the issuance of common shares 
the remaining outstanding principal balance of  as of september  will require future principal payments of  per month through april plus a balloon payment of  in may  although it may be accelerated by the holder under certain conditions 
on march   we terminated the merger agreement for the acquisition of narrowstep  which merger agreement we had first entered into on may  the merger agreement could be terminated by either onstream or narrowstep at any time after november  provided that the terminating party was not responsible for the delay 
on december   narrowstep filed a complaint against us in the court of chancery of the state of delaware  alleging breach of contract  fraud and three additional counts and seeking i million in damages  ii reimbursement of an unspecified amount for all of its costs associated with the negotiation and drafting of the merger agreement  including but not limited to attorney and consulting fees  iii the return of narrowstep s equipment alleged to be in our possession  iv reimbursement of an unspecified amount for all of its attorneys fees  costs and interest associated with this action and v any further relief determined as fair by the court 
after reviewing the complaint document  we determined that narrowstep had no basis in fact or in law for any claim and accordingly  this matter was not been reflected as a liability on our financial statements 
on december  narrowstep counsel advised the court in writing that narrowstep had reached an agreement in principle with us to dismiss their lawsuit with prejudice  provided that both parties executed a mutual release 
under this mutual release  which has been agreed to in principle by both parties but is still being finalized  no further actions will be filed against each other or affiliated parties in connection with this matter

results of operations our consolidated net loss for the year ended september  was approximately million loss per share as compared to a loss of approximately million loss per share for the prior fiscal year  a decrease in our loss of approximately million 
the decreased net loss was primarily due to compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended september  that were approximately million lower and million lower  respectively  than such expenses for the prior fiscal year 
in addition  the million charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the current fiscal year was  lower than the million charge for such item in the prior fiscal year 
these items were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately  or  for the year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the following table shows  for the periods presented  the percentage of revenue represented by items on our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended september  revenue dmsp and hosting webcasting audio and web conferencing network usage other total revenue cost of revenue dmsp and hosting webcasting audio and web conferencing network usage other total costs of revenue gross margin operating expenses compensation professional fees other general and administrative write off deferred acquisition costs impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net interest expense other income  net total other expense  net net loss the following table is presented to illustrate our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
this table should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes therein 
for the years ended september  increase decrease amount percent total revenue total costs of revenue gross margin general and administrative expenses write off deferred acquisition costs impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net net loss revenues and gross margin consolidated operating revenue was approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year  due to decreased revenues of the audio and web conferencing services group 
audio and web conferencing services group revenues were approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily a result of decreased infinite division revenues arising from the loss of a major customer during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as decreased network usage service fees from the ednet division  which decrease we believe resulted from a reduction in television and movie production activity in the current fiscal year in response to a general economic slow down 
the number of minutes billed by the infinite division was approximately million for the year ended september   as compared to approximately million minutes billed for the prior fiscal year 
however  the average revenue per minute was approximately cents for the year ended september   as compared to approximately cents for the prior fiscal year 
the average revenue per minute statistic includes auxiliary services and fees that are not billed to the customer on a per minute basis 
for some time the infinite division sales force has been focusing on entering into agreements with organizations with resources to provide infinite s audio and web conferencing services to certain targeted groups 
this included agreements with proforma  a leading provider of graphic communications solutions  a reseller agreement with copper conferencing  a leading  carrier class conferencing services provider for small and medium sized businesses  a master agency agreement with presidio networked solutions  a systems integrator and a collaboration with peerport to launch webmeet community  an integrated suite of virtual collaboration services 
in march we announced the expansion of infinite s alliance with bt conferencing by providing a jointly developed conferencing platform to infinite s reservationless client base 
although these relationships and initiatives are important as a basis for building future sales  in some cases there will be a lead time of a year or longer before they are reflected in actual recorded sales 
furthermore  we relatively recently reorganized the infinite management and sales staff  which included the hiring of a new divisional president in june the revenues of the audio and web conferencing services group for the three months ended september  were approximately  greater than those revenues for the corresponding fiscal quarter  with this increase almost entirely related to the infinite division 
we expect this trend to continue and accordingly we expect the fiscal revenues of the audio and web conferencing services group for the year as a whole to exceed the fiscal amounts  although this increase cannot be assured 
digital media services group revenues were approximately million for the year ended september   an increase of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an approximately  net increase in dmsp and hosting revenues over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in dmsp and hosting revenues included i an approximately  increase in hosting and bandwidth charges to certain larger dmsp customers serviced by our smart encoding division and ii an approximately  increase in the dmsp division s revenues from its store and stream and streaming publisher products 
this  increase was partially offset by an approximately  decrease in smart encoding division revenues for services other than hosting 
as of september   we had monthly recurring subscribers to the store and stream and or streaming publisher applications of the dmsp  which applications were developed as a focused interface for small to medium business smb clients  as compared to subscribers as of september  including large dmsp hosting customers supported by our smart encoding division  these customer counts were and  respectively 
we expect this dmsp customer base to continue to grow  especially as a result of the launch of mp discussed below 
in addition to the store and stream and streaming publisher applications of the dmsp  we are continuing to work with several entities assisting us in the deployment via the dmsp of enabling technologies necessary to create social networks with integrated professional and user generated multimedia content 
one of the key components of our march acquisition of auction video was the video ingestion and flash transcoder  already integrated into the dmsp as an integral component of the services offered to social network providers and other user generated video ugv applications 
auction video s technology may be used in various applications such as online yellow pages listings  delivering video to mobile phones  multi level marketing and online newspaper classified advertisements  and can also provide for direct input from webcams and other imaging equipment 
in addition  our auction video service was approved by ebay to provide video hosting services for ebay users and powersellers high volume users of ebay 
the auction video acquisition was another strategic step in providing a complete range of enabling  turnkey technologies for our clients to facilitate video on the web applications  which we believe will make the dmsp a more competitive option as an increasing number of companies look to enhance their web presence with digital rich media and social applications 
in addition to the beneficial effect of the auction video technology on dmsp revenues  we believe that our ownership of that technology will provide us with other revenue opportunities  including software sales and licensing fees  although the timing and amount of these revenues cannot be assured 
in march we retained the law firm of hunton williams to assist in expediting the patent approval process and helping protect our rights related to our patent pending ugv technology 
in april  we revised the original patent application primarily for the purpose of splitting it into two separate applications  which  while related  are being evaluated separately by the us patent office uspo 
with respect to the claims pending in the first of the two applications  the uspo issued non final rejections in august  february and may  as well as final rejections in january and june our responses to certain of these rejections included modifications to certain claims made in the original patent application 
in response to the latest rejection we filed a notice of appeal with the uspo on november  and the expected next step is our filing of an appeal brief with the uspo  which is due on january   although extensions for this filing are available until june  with the payment of additional fees 
after our appeal brief is filed  the uspo would be expected to file a response and following that  a decision would be made by a three member panel  either based on the filings or a hearing if requested by us 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of this matter  our management has determined that an adverse decision with respect to this patent application would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the uspo has taken no formal action with regard to the second of the two applications 
certain of the former owners of auction video  inc have an interest in proceeds that we may receive under certain circumstances in connection with these patents 
as a result of this technology plus other planned enhancements to the dmsp  the expected favorable impact of the recently launched mp and our increased sales and marketing focus on opportunities with social networks and other high volume users of digital rich media  we expect the fiscal dmsp and hosting revenues for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
webcasting revenues increased by approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we have historically experienced a seasonal decline in webcasting revenues during the fourth quarter  as compared to the preceding third quarter 
however  the decline in webcasting revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to such revenues for the third quarter of fiscal  was less than the decline in webcasting revenues that we experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to such revenues for the third quarter of fiscal the number of webcasts produced  approximately  for the year ended september   was approximately equal to the number of webcasts for the prior fiscal year and the average revenue per webcast event of approximately for the year ended september  was approximately equal to the prior fiscal year 
the number of webcasts reported  as well as the resulting calculation of the average revenue per webcast event  does not include any webcast events attributed with or less revenue  based on our determination that excluding such low priced or even no charge events increases the usefulness of this statistic 
in addition  we believe that the following factors will favorably impact our webcasting revenues for fiscal expanding government related business in november we announced that we had been awarded a stake in a three year master services agreement msa by the state of california to provide video and audio streaming services to the state and participating local governments 
in august we announced that we had been awarded three new multi year public sector webcasting services contracts with the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc  california state department of technology services dts  and california state board of equalization boe 
in april we announced that  in addition to the extension of the nrc contract for the first full year after a successful initial test period  we were engaged to perform webcasting services for use by the us department of interior  minerals management service  via a strategic partner relationship 
in november  we announced that we were engaged to perform webcasting services for the department of the treasury s internal revenue service irs and to provide webinar services for use by the us department of housing and urban development s federal housing administration fha philadelphia homeownership center hoc  via a strategic partner relationship 
we also announced the extension of the nrc contract  discussed above  for the second full year 
we recognized aggregate revenues for the above government related contracts of approximately  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively  which represents a increase 
our financial statements for these periods include webcasting revenues from government related business not included in these numbers  as these numbers only relate to the specific government related contracts that we have publicly announced  as listed above 
new products and technology iencode is a full featured  turnkey  standalone webcasting solution  designed to operate inside a corporate lan environment with multicast capabilities 
although we recorded some iencode revenue during fiscal prior to the introduction of version v of iencode in june  v was not available for delivery to our customers until december and we have continued to make some technical improvements after that date 
although iencode sales have been limited to date  we expect them to start to increase to more meaningful levels during fiscal we have relatively recently completed several feature enhancements to our proprietary webcasting platform including a premium flash webcasting service announced by us in november for the google android smartphone platform 
in addition to delivering webcasts to android based mobile users  the new flash based webcasting solution enhances our traditional online webcasting service to existing clients as well as opens up a new market for us with enterprise customers 
bt reseller agreement in october  we announced an expansion of our business relationship with bt conferencing  a division of bt group plc  one of the world leading providers of communications solutions and services  via the signing of a new webcasting  iencode  and digital media services reseller agreement 
prior to this agreement  and continuing to the current time  we recognized significant webcasting revenues from a bt business group that had succeeded to our business relationship with another reseller  by virtue of bt s acquisition of that reseller 
under the reseller agreement announced in october  another business group within bt conferencing will also be offering our webcasting  iencode and digital media services to its new and existing clients worldwide 
the implementation of this new agreement is in process and is expected to first impact our revenues in a meaningful way during fiscal organizational changes in october  we announced ari kestin s appointment as the executive vice president and general manager of our webcasting division 
in his new role with the webcasting division  mr 
kestin will be responsible for all client facing activities  sales and marketing  operations  partnerships  product and application development within the division 
mr 
kestin will also continue as president of the infinite division  a position he has held since june as a result of the above factors  we expect fiscal webcasting revenues for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
during fiscal  we began the development of the marketplace mp platform  which enables the creation of on line virtual marketplaces  trade shows and social communities  with the goal of generating business leads for our customers  the mp site promoters 
there are currently four active mp promoter sites subway a private marketplace for internal use by subway vendors  franchisees and staff and the first site launched in july  home service expo a general public accessible marketplace providing services for homeowners in the dade  broward and palm beach counties of florida launched in november  green light expo a general public accessible global products and services expo targeting all things green for lifestyle and business applications launched in november and proactive capital forum general public accessible and believed to be the first financial tradeshow concentrating on companies in the life sciences and technology areas launched in november 
fred deluca  co founder and co owner of subway and active in the management of that company  is one of our major shareholders and also controls rockridge capital holdings  llc  an entity to which we owe approximately million as of september  and which debt is convertible into shares of our common stock under certain conditions 
the promoter of green light expo s mp site is also affiliated with subway 
in addition to the four active marketplaces  we have signed mp promoter contracts for another marketplaces  several of which we expect will launch and become active in the coming weeks and months 
in addition  we have entered into several mp agent agreements  including the following in december  we announced an agreement with the tarsus group plc tarsus for them to market mp to tarsus more than  trade shows and  suppliers that are part of their trade show news network tsnn  a leading online resource for the trade show  exhibition and event industry 
in february  we announced an agreement with the trade show exhibitors association tsea for them to market mp to tsea s members  vendors and sponsors 
in april  we announced an agreement with amc institute  to provide mp  as well as our full suite of digital media and communications services  to the organization s association management company members who represent over  associations throughout the us  canada  europe and asia 
in may  we announced an mp agent agreement with conventions 
net  which has thousands of industry suppliers in over categories and plans to showcase the mp platform through its website and other marketing vehicles 
we will charge each promoter a monthly fee based on the number of exhibitors within their mp marketplace  as well as a share of the revenue from advertising in their mp marketplace  but we also expect to recognize additional revenue beyond these exhibitor and advertising fees since mp will integrate with and utilize almost all of our other technologies including dmsp  webcasting  ugc and conferencing 
special pricing and payment terms have been granted to subway and may be granted to other mp promoters  particularly during the initial stages of introducing the mp platform 
once we are past the initial introductory stage and as the process of launching mp sites continues  we expect that revenues from mp will begin to be a meaningful part of our overall operating results 
however  the attainment of any revenue from a mp marketplace or promoter contract will be subject to various factors  including the implementation of the mp product by the promoter purchaser  including the sales of booths to exhibitors and related advertising  which amount and timing cannot be assured 
due to the anticipated increases in webcasting and dmsp and hosting revenues  as well as our anticipation of meaningful revenues in fiscal from the recently launched mp platform  all as discussed above  we expect the fiscal revenues of the digital media services group for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
consolidated gross margin was approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due to approximately  less gross margin from the audio and web conferencing services group  corresponding to the decrease in audio and web conferencing services group revenues as discussed above  as well as decreased gross margin percentage on those revenues from to 
primary reasons for this decreased gross margin percentage were i certain costs related to providing webconferencing services that are generally fixed to us and do not vary with utilization ii increased costs from purchasing additional overflow operating capacity from third parties and iii decreases in our per minute charges to certain customers deemed necessary in order to respond to competition 
the consolidated gross margin percentage was for the year ended september   versus for the prior fiscal year 
based on our expectation that the fiscal revenues of both the audio and web conferencing services group and the digital media services group for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  as discussed above  we expect consolidated gross margin in dollars for fiscal year for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
however  it is possible that gross margin as a percentage of the related revenue for fiscal year may be lower than such percentage for fiscal year  since i we expect continued price pressure in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  arising from competition in all of our major product lines and ii it is possible that the infinite division s cost of sales  on a per minute basis  may increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  in order for us to attract larger customers by increasing the reliability of the subcontractors supporting our service offerings 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately million from the prior fiscal year  primarily because compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense each decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended september   as compared to those expenses for the prior fiscal year 
in addition  the million charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the current fiscal year was  lower than the million charge for such item in the prior fiscal year and we recorded an approximately  charge for the write off of deferred acquisition costs for the year ended september  versus no such expense in the current fiscal year 
this write off related to the terminated narrowstep acquisition  which is discussed in more detail in item of part i of this k 
the decrease in compensation expense for the year ended september  of approximately million was of that expense for the prior fiscal year 
effective october   a significant portion of our workforce  including all of management  took a payroll reduction  which we expect will be maintained until increased revenue levels result in positive cash flow sufficient to cover capital expenditures and debt service 
this action  as well as payroll cost reduction actions we took primarily during february and march  continued in resulting in compensation expense reductions of approximately million for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and are therefore the primary reason for the decreased compensation expense during fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended september  of approximately million was of that expense for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to i reduced depreciation expense related to the dmsp as a result of certain dmsp components reaching the end of the useful lives assigned to them for book depreciation purposes and ii reduced amortization expense related to certain intangible assets as a result of the impairment losses we recorded during the year ended september  and the year ended september   which were recorded as a reduction of the historical depreciable cost basis of those assets as of those dates 
the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the asc  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
although other intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  the unamortized balances are still subject to review and adjustment for impairment 
there is a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
we performed impairment tests on infinite  ednet and acquired onstream as of december  we assessed the fair value of the net assets of these reporting units by considering the projected cash flows and by analysis of comparable companies  including such factors as the relationship of the comparable companies revenues to their respective market values 
based on these factors  we concluded that there was no impairment of the assets of ednet as of that date 
although the first step of the two step testing process of the assets of acquired onstream and infinite preliminarily indicated that the fair value of those intangible assets exceeded their recorded carrying value as of december   it was noted that as a result of the then recent substantial volatility in the capital markets  the price of our common stock and our market value had decreased significantly and as of december   our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations  was determined to be less than our net book value ie  stockholders equity as reflected in our financial statements 
based on this condition  and in accordance with the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the asc  we recorded a non cash expense  for the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets  of million for the year ended september  this million adjustment was determined to relate to million of goodwill and intangible assets of infinite   of intangible assets of auction video and million of goodwill of acquired onstream 
we also performed impairment tests on infinite  ednet and acquired onstream as of december   using the same methodologies discussed above 
based on these factors  we concluded that there was no impairment of the assets of acquired onstream or ednet as of that date 
however  we determined that infinite s goodwill and certain of its intangible assets were impaired as of that date and based on that condition  and in accordance with the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the asc  we recorded a non cash expense  for the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets  of million for the year ended september  as the result of the decline in the price of our common stock from per share as of march  to as of june   it appeared that our market value after certain adjustments as discussed above was probably less than our net book value as of june  however  we concluded that the decline in market value as of june  was not of sufficient duration nor was it otherwise indicative of a triggering event that would require an interim impairment review 
however  this decline continued after june  and resulted in a common stock price of as of september  and as of december  as a result  we determined that it was appropriate for us to evaluate whether our goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as of september  we performed impairment tests on infinite  ednet and acquired onstream as of september   using the same methodologies discussed above 
based on these factors  we concluded that there was no impairment of the assets of infinite or ednet as of that date 
however  we determined that acquired onstream s goodwill and certain of its intangible assets were impaired as of that date and based on that condition  and as discussed above  in accordance with the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the asc  we recorded a non cash expense  for the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets  of million  which combined with the adjustment described above  resulted in a total impairment expense of million for the year ended september  the valuations of infinite  ednet and acquired onstream incorporate our management s estimates of future sales and operating income  which estimates in the cases of infinite and acquired onstream are dependent on products audio and web conferencing and the dmsp  respectively from which significant sales and or sales increases may be required to support that valuation 
furthermore  even if our market value were to exceed our net book value in the future  annual reviews for impairment in future periods may result in future periodic write downs 
tests for impairment between annual tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the net carrying amount 
since we do not expect continued material reductions in compensation expense or depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect our consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year to be approximately equal to the corresponding prior year amounts excluding any reduction arising from fiscal reductions in goodwill impairment charges as compared to those costs in fiscal  although this cannot be assured 
other expense other expense of approximately million for the year ended september  represented an approximately  increase as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this additional expense was primarily related to an increase in interest expense of approximately  arising from a much higher level of interest bearing debt  as well as increased effective interest rates  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september as of september   we had outstanding interest bearing debt with a total face amount of approximately million  versus approximately million as of september  the million was primarily comprised of i approximately million in borrowings outstanding for working capital under a line of credit arrangement the line  ii convertible debentures for financing software and equipment purchases with a balance of million and bearing interest expense at per annum and iii the rockridge note balance of approximately million  which did not exist until april and carries an effective interest rate of approximately per annum after the september amendment 
in addition to the above  we have received cash proceeds from interest bearing financing activities  net of repayments  of another approximately  during the year ended september  approximately  of these cash proceeds relate to additional borrowings aggregating million  under the greenberg note in january   under the wilmington notes in february and  under the lehmann note in may less  of principal payments against those notes 
the effective interest rates on these notes range from to per annum  with a weighted average rate of per annum 
in addition to the increases in our outstanding debt as noted above  the line was amended in december and as a result the interest rate modified to be per annum  adjusted for future changes in the prime rate  plus a weekly monitoring fee of one twentieth of a percent of the borrowing limit 
the interest rate at the time of the amendment was per annum prime rate plus but there was no monitoring fee 
based on the outstanding balance of approximately million under the line as of september   the amended terms would represent increased interest expense  including the monitoring fee  of approximately  per year 
as a result of the january renegotiation of the terms of the  ccj note  including related changes to series a preferred also held by ccj  the effective interest rate on the ccj note increased from per annum to approximately per annum see the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below for details 
although a significant portion of the remaining outstanding balance due on the borrowings made during fiscal was repaid on october  using proceeds from non interest bearing equity financing  based on the remaining outstanding interest bearing portion of that debt  the increased interest rate on the line that was not effective for the entirety of fiscal  the increased effective interest rate on the ccj note from january and potential further borrowings in fiscal in order to address our working capital deficit  we anticipate our interest expense during fiscal to at least be equal to  or potentially greater than  that expense for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our financial statements for the year ended september  reflect a net loss of approximately million and cash used in operations for that period of approximately  although we had cash of approximately  at september   our working capital was a deficit of approximately million at that date 
during the year ended september   we obtained financing from four primary sources i the sale of our common and preferred stock under the terms of the lpc purchase agreement  discussed in more detail below and which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately  during the period ii the unsecured subordinated convertible greenberg note  wilmington notes and lehmann note  under which we borrowed an aggregate of  net of repayments during the period  iii the line  collateralized by our accounts receivable  under which we borrowed approximately  net of repayments during the period and iv the rockridge note  collateralized by all our assets not pledged under the line  under which we borrowed approximately  net of repayments during the period 
on september   we entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with lincoln park capital fund  llc lpc  whereby lpc agreed to an initial purchase of  shares of our common stock and  shares of our series a preferred stock series a  together with warrants to purchase  of our common shares 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  lpc also received  shares of our common stock as a one time commitment fee and a cash payment of  as a one time structuring fee 
on september   we received net proceeds of  from lpc in exchange for our issuance of the above shares and warrants 
after deducting legal  accounting and other out of pocket costs incurred by us in connection with this transaction  the net cash proceeds were during the period from october  through january  lpc purchased an additional  shares of our common stock under that purchase agreement for net proceeds of approximately  lpc has also committed to purchase  at our sole discretion  up to an additional  shares of our common stock in installments over the remaining term of the purchase agreement  generally at prevailing market prices  but subject to the specific restrictions and conditions in the purchase agreement 
there is no upper limit to the price lpc may pay to purchase these additional shares 
the purchase of our shares by lpc will occur on dates determined solely by us and the purchase price of the shares will be fixed on the purchase date and will be equal to the lesser of i the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date or ii the average of the three lowest closing sale prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive business days prior to the date of a purchase by lpc 
lpc shall not have the right or the obligation to purchase any shares of our common stock from us at a price below per share 
in addition  we have agreed to use our best efforts to get  within days from the date of the purchase agreement  shareholder approval to sell up to an additional  of our common shares to lpc  which upon such approval lpc has agreed to purchase  at our sole discretion and subject to the same restrictions and conditions in the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement has a term of months but may be terminated by us at any time after the first year at our discretion without any cost to us and may be terminated by us at any time in the event lpc does not purchase shares as directed by us in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
lpc may terminate the purchase agreement upon certain events of default set forth therein  including but not limited to the occurrence of a material adverse effect  delisting of our common stock and the lack of immediate relisting on one of the specified alternate markets and the lapse of the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement for more than the specified number of days 
the purchase agreement restricts our use of variable priced financings for the greater of one year or the term of the purchase agreement and  in the event of future financings by us  allows lpc the right to participate under conditions specified in the purchase agreement 
the shares of common stock sold and issued under the purchase agreement and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of series a  were sold and issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed by us on september  with the securities and exchange commission in connection with a takedown of an aggregate of million shares from our shelf registration 
in connection with the purchase agreement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement with lpc  dated september   under which we agreed  among other things  to use our best efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the maturity date as defined in the purchase agreement and to indemnify lpc for certain liabilities in connection with the sale of the securities 
from january through may we issued the unsecured subordinated convertible greenberg note  wilmington notes and lehmann note  for aggregate gross proceeds of million  as discussed above 
the remaining principal balance of the greenberg and wilmington notes  representing  in original borrowing  was  as of september  this  balance  as well as all accrued but unpaid interest  was satisfied by us on october  with cash payments aggregating  plus the issuance of  unregistered common shares 
the effective rate of the greenberg note was initially calculated to be approximately per annum  assuming a one year loan term 
the effective rate of the wilmington notes was initially calculated to be approximately per annum  assuming a six month loan term and excluding the finder s fees payable by us to a third party in cash and equal to of the borrowed amount 
the lehmann note  an unsecured subordinated convertible note under which we borrowed  in may  is repayable in principal installments of  per month beginning july   with the final payment on may   including remaining principal and all accrued but unpaid interest at per annum 
the lehmann note is convertible into common stock at lehmann s option based on our closing share price on the funding date of the lehmann note  which was 
 of the amount we borrowed under the wilmington notes in february came from lehmann 
the lehmann note provides for i our issuance of  unregistered common shares upon receipt of the funds and our issuance of  unregistered common shares if the loan is still outstanding after months and ii our prepayment of the first six months of interest in the form of shares  based on our closing share price on the funding date of the lehmann note 
in the event the lehmann note is prepaid after the first six months  the second tranche of  unregistered common shares will be cancelled on a pro rata basis  to the extent the second six month time period has not elapsed at the time of such payoff 
the effective rate of the lehmann note is approximately per annum  assuming a six month loan term and excluding the finder s fees payable by us to a third party in cash and equal to of the borrowed amount 
we may prepay the lehmann note at any time with ten days notice  provided that lehmann may convert the outstanding balance to common shares during such ten day period 
if we successfully conclude a financing of debt or equity in excess of  during the term of the lehmann note  the proceeds of such financing will be used to pay off the remaining balance of the lehmann note 
although the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of common and preferred shares under the lpc purchase agreement exceeded  as of november   our position is that the sale of shares in october  november and december were separate financings from the initial sale of shares in september and since none of those financings were in excess of  early repayment of the lehmann note is not required 
in the event of a default  uncured after the notice provisions in the note  we will be obligated to pay lehmann an additional interest per month based on the outstanding loan balance and pro rated on a daily basis until the default has been cured  payable in cash or unregistered common shares 
the maximum allowable borrowing amount under the line is now million  subject to certain formulas with respect to the amount and aging of the underlying receivables 
the outstanding balance approximately million as of december  bears interest at per annum  adjustable based on changes in prime after december   plus a weekly monitoring fee of one twentieth of a percent of the borrowing limit 
the outstanding principal under the line may be repaid at any time  but no later than december  which term may be extended by us for an extra year  subject to compliance with all loan terms  including no material adverse change  as well as concurrence of the lender 
during fiscal we borrowed million from rockridge capital holdings  llc rockridge  an entity controlled by one of our largest shareholders  in accordance with the terms of a note and stock purchase agreement that we entered into with rockridge dated april  and amended on september  we received another  under the note and stock purchase agreement on october   resulting in cumulative allowable borrowings of million 
in connection with this transaction  we issued a note the rockridge note  which is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets  such lien subordinated only to the extent higher priority liens on assets  primarily accounts receivable and certain designated software and equipment  are held by certain of our other lenders 
we also entered into a security agreement with rockridge that contains certain covenants and other restrictions with respect to the collateral 
the rockridge note  which had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million at september   is repayable in equal monthly installments of  extending through august  the maturity date  which installments include principal except for a  balloon payable at the maturity date and which balloon payment is also convertible into restricted onsm common shares under certain circumstances plus interest at per annum on the remaining unpaid balance 
upon notice from rockridge at any time prior to the maturity date  up to fifty percent of the outstanding principal amount of the rockridge note excluding the balloon payment subject to conversion per the previous sentence may be converted into a number of restricted shares of onsm common stock 
if we sell all or substantially all of our assets  or at any time after september  and prior to the maturity date  the remaining outstanding principal amount of the rockridge note may be converted by rockridge into a number of restricted shares of onsm common stock 
the above conversions are subject to a minimum of one month between conversion notices unless such conversion amount exceeds  and will use a conversion price of eighty percent of the fair market value of the average closing bid price for onsm common stock for the twenty days of trading on the nasdaq capital market or such other exchange or market on which onsm common shares are trading prior to such rockridge notice  but such conversion price will not be less than per share 
the note and stock purchase agreement also provides that rockridge may receive an origination fee  upon not less than sixty one days written notice to us  of  restricted shares of our common stock the shares 
the value of those shares is subject to a limited guaranty of no more than an additional payment by us of  which will be effective in the event the shares are sold for an average share price less than the minimum of per share 
the effective interest rate of the rockridge note was approximately per annum  until the september amendment  at which time it was reduced to approximately per annum 
these rates exclude the potential effect of a premium to market prices if the balloon payment is satisfied in common shares instead of cash as well as the potential effect of any appreciation in the value of the shares at the time of issuance beyond their value at the date of the rockridge agreement or the amendment  as applicable 
we are currently obligated under convertible equipment notes with a face value of million which are collateralized by specifically designated software and equipment owned by us with a cost basis of approximately million  as well as a subordinated lien on certain other of our assets to the extent that the designated software and equipment  or other software and equipment added to the collateral at a later date  is not considered sufficient security for the loan 
interest is payable every months in cash or  at our option  in restricted onsm common shares  based on a conversion price equal to seventy five percent of the average onsm closing price for the thirty trading days prior to the date the applicable payment is due 
on november   we elected to issue  unregistered shares of our common stock to the investors in lieu of  cash interest on these equipment notes for the period from may through october  which was recorded as interest expense of  on our books  based on the fair value of those shares on the issuance date 
on april   we elected to issue  unregistered common shares to the investors in lieu of  cash interest on these equipment notes for november through april  which was recorded as interest expense of  on our books  based on the fair value of those shares on the issuance date 
on december   we elected to issue  unregistered shares of our common stock to the investors in lieu of  cash interest on these equipment notes for the period from may through october  which was recorded as interest expense of  on our books  based on the fair value of those shares on the issuance date 
the equipment notes may be converted to restricted onsm common shares at any time prior to their maturity date  at the holder s option  based on a conversion price equal to seventy five percent of the average onsm closing price for the thirty trading days prior to the date of conversion  but in no event may the conversion price be less than per share 
in the event the notes are converted prior to maturity june   interest on the equipment notes for the remaining unexpired loan period will be due and payable in additional restricted onsm common shares in accordance with the same formula for interest as described above 
during august  ccj trust ccj remitted  to us as a short term advance bearing interest at per day equivalent to approximately per annum until the date of repayment or unless the parties mutually agreed to another financing transaction s prior to repayment 
this advance was included in accounts payable on our september  balance sheet 
on december   we entered into an agreement with ccj whereby accrued interest through that date of  was paid by us in cash and the  advance was converted to an unsecured subordinated note payable at a rate of interest per annum in equal monthly installments of principal and interest for months plus a  principal balloon at maturity the ccj note although none of those payments were subsequently made by us 
to resolve this payment default  the ccj note was amended in january to prospectively increase the interest rate to per annum  payable quarterly  and to require two principal payments of  each on december  and december   respectively 
this amendment also called for our cash payment of the previously accrued interest in the amount of  on or before january  the remaining principal balance of this note may be converted at any time into our common shares at the greater of i the previous day market value or ii per share which was per share prior to the january renegotiation 
in conjunction with and in consideration of the december note transaction  the  shares of series a held by ccj at that date were exchanged for  shares of series a plus four year warrants for the purchase of  onsm common shares at per share 
in conjunction with and in consideration of the january note amendment  it was agreed that certain terms of the  shares of series a held by ccj at that date would be modified 
the effective interest rate of the ccj note prior to the january amendment was approximately per annum  including the black scholes value of the warrants plus the value of the increased number of common shares underlying the series a shares versus the series a shares 
the effective rate of per annum also included per annum related to dividends that would have accrued to ccj as a result of the later mandatory conversion date of the series a shares versus the mandatory conversion date of the series a shares 
following the january amendment  the effective interest rate of the ccj note increased to approximately per annum  to reflect the value of the increased value of common shares underlying the series a shares as a result of the modified terms as well as the increase in the periodic cash interest rate from to per annum 
the effective rate of per annum also includes per annum related to dividends that could accrue to ccj as a result of the later mandatory conversion date of the series a shares as a result of the modified terms 
projected capital expenditures for the twelve months ended september  total approximately million which includes software and hardware upgrades to the dmsp  the webcasting system including iencode and the audio and web conferencing infrastructure  as well as costs of software development and hardware costs in connection with the introduction and establishment of the marketplace platform 
this total includes at least  of projected capital expenditures which we have determined may be financed  deferred past the twelve month period or cancelled entirely  depending on our other cash flow considerations 
this total excludes approximately  reflected by us as accounts payable at september   primarily representing amounts that are presently the subject of litigation and which will not be reflected as capital expenditures in our cash flow statement until paid 
we have estimated that we would require an approximately increase in our consolidated revenues  as compared to our revenues for the twelve months ended september   in order to adequately fund our anticipated operating cash expenditures for the next twelve months including cash interest expense and a basic level of capital expenditures 
due to seasonality  this increase would be accomplished if we were to achieve average revenues over the next four quarters equivalent to the revenues for the third quarter of fiscal we have estimated that  in addition to this revenue increase  we will also require additional debt or equity financing of approximately to million in addition to recent sales of common and preferred shares discussed above over the next twelve months to satisfy principal repayments due against existing debt other than debt repaid from the proceeds of recent sales of common and preferred shares discussed below as well as past due trade payables that we believe are necessary to pay to continue our operations 
however  approximately million of this to million would not be required until june if we were to achieve revenue increases in excess of this  or if any of our lenders elected to convert a portion of the existing debt to equity as allowed for under its terms  the required financing could be less than this to million 
however  if we did not achieve these revenue increases  or if our operating expenses  cash interest or capital expenditures were higher than anticipated over the next twelve months  the required financing could be greater than this to million 
we have implemented and continue to implement specific actions  including hiring additional sales personnel  developing new products and initiating new marketing programs  geared towards achieving revenue increases 
the costs associated with these actions were contemplated in the above calculations 
however  in the event we are unable to achieve the required revenue increases  we believe that a combination of identified decreases in our current level of expenditures that we would implement and the raising of additional capital in the form of debt and or equity that we believe we could obtain from identified sources would be sufficient to allow us to operate for the next twelve months 
we will closely monitor our revenue and other business activity to determine if further cost reductions  the raising of additional capital  or other activity is considered necessary 
a prospectus allowing us to offer and sell up to million of our registered common shares shelf registration was declared effective by the sec on april  in connection with the lpc purchase agreement million common shares including shares issuable upon conversion of preferred shares were included in a prospectus supplement filed by us on september  with the sec as a takedown under the shelf registration 
however  there is no assurance that we will sell additional shares to lpc under the purchase agreement or that we will sell additional shares under the shelf registration  or if we do make such sales what the timing or proceeds will be 
in addition  we may incur fees in connection with such sales 
furthermore  sales under the shelf registration that exceed in aggregate twenty percent of our outstanding shares would be subject to prior shareholder approval 
on january   we received a funding commitment letter the funding letter from j c resources  inc j c irrevocably agreeing to provide us  within twenty days after our notice given on or before december   aggregate cash funding of up to  which may be requested in multiple tranches 
mr 
charles johnston  one of our directors  is the president of j c 
this funding letter was obtained by us solely to demonstrate our ability to obtain short term funds in the event other funding sources are not available  but does not represent any obligation on our part to accept such funding on these terms and is not expected by us to be exercised 
the cash provided under the funding letter would be in exchange for our issuance of a a note or notes with interest payable monthly at per annum and principal payable on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or july  and b our issuance of million unregistered common shares  which shares would be prorated in the case of partial funding 
the note or notes would be unsecured and subordinated to all of our other debts  except to the extent such the terms of such debts would allow pari passu status 
furthermore  the note or notes would not be subject to any provisions  other than with respect to priority of payments or collateral  of our other debts 
upon receipt by us of an equivalent amount in dollars of investment from any other source after the date of this funding letter  other than funding received in connection with the lpc purchase agreement  this funding letter will be terminated 
we have incurred losses since our inception  and have an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of september  our operations have been financed primarily through the issuance of equity and debt 
cash required to fund our continued operations will be affected by numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  our ability to successfully market and sell the dmsp  iencode and marketplace as well as our other existing products and services  the degree to which competitive products and services are introduced to the market  our ability to control and or reduce expenses  our need to invest in new equipment and or technology  and our ability to service and or refinance our existing debt and accounts payable 
we cannot assure that our revenues will continue at their present levels  nor can we assure that they will not decrease 
as long as our cash flow from sales remains insufficient to completely fund operating expenses  financing costs and capital expenditures  we will continue depleting our cash and other financial resources 
other than working capital which may become available to us from further borrowing or sales of equity including but not limited to proceeds from the lpc purchase agreement  shelf registration or funding letter  as discussed above  we do not presently have any additional sources of working capital other than cash on hand and cash  if any  generated from operations 
as a result of the uncertainty as to our available working capital over the upcoming months  we may be required to delay or cancel certain of the projected capital expenditures  some of the planned marketing expenditures  or other planned expenses 
in addition  it is likely that we will need to seek additional capital through equity and or debt financing 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt  this will result in increased interest expense 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution 
our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to raise capital and to market and sell our services successfully 
however  there are no assurances whatsoever that we will be able to sell additional common shares or other forms of equity under the lpc purchase agreement  the shelf registration or otherwise and or that we will be able to borrow further funds under the funding letter or otherwise and or that we will increase our revenues and or control our expenses to a level sufficient to provide positive cash flow 
cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended september   as compared to approximately  provided by operations for the prior fiscal year 
the  reflects our net loss of approximately million  reduced by approximately million of non cash expenses included in that loss and reduced by approximately  arising from a net decrease in non cash working capital items during the period 
the net decrease in non cash working capital items for the year ended september  is primarily due to an approximately  increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and amounts due to directors and officers  offset by an approximately  increase in accounts receivable 
this compares to a net decrease in non cash working capital items of approximately million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  primarily due to an approximately  increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities amounts due to directors and officers 
the primary non cash expenses included in our loss for the year ended september  were million arising from a charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  approximately million of depreciation and amortization  approximately  of employee compensation expense arising from the issuance of stock and options and approximately  of amortization of deferred professional fee expenses paid for by issuing stock and options 
the primary sources of cash inflows from operations are from receivables collected from sales to customers 
future cash inflows from sales are subject to our pricing and ability to procure business at existing market conditions 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
current and prior period investing activities primarily related to the acquisition of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
current and prior year financing activities primarily related to net proceeds from notes payable and convertible debentures  net of repayments 
the current year also included proceeds from the sale of common stock and a preferred shares and the prior year also included proceeds from the sale of a preferred shares 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and our significant accounting policies are described in note to those statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the management s most subjective judgments 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described as follows 
our prior acquisitions of several businesses  including the onstream merger and the infinite merger  have resulted in significant increases in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets  which include acquired customer lists  were approximately million at september   representing approximately of our total assets and approximately of the book value of shareholder equity 
in addition  property and equipment as of september  includes approximately million net of depreciation related to the dmsp and other capitalized internal use software  representing approximately of our total assets and approximately of the book value of shareholder equity 
in accordance with gaap  we periodically test these assets for potential impairment 
as part of our testing  we rely on both historical operating performance as well as anticipated future operating performance of the entities that have generated these intangibles 
factors that could indicate potential impairment include a significant change in projected operating results and cash flow  a new technology developed and other external market factors that may affect our customer base 
we will continue to monitor our intangible assets and our overall business environment 
if there is a material adverse and ongoing change in our business operations or if an adverse change initially considered temporary is determined to be ongoing  the value of our intangible assets  including those of our dmsp or infinite divisions  could decrease significantly 
in the event that it is determined that we will be unable to successfully market or sell our dmsp or audio and web conferencing services  an impairment charge to our statement of operations could result 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets  although not requiring any additional cash outlay  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we follow a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment and described above  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment  including a comparison and reconciliation of the carrying value of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations 
if our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations  is determined to be less than our net book value ie  stockholders equity as reflected in our financial statements  that condition might indicate an impairment requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets  although not requiring any additional cash outlay  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as the result of a recent decline in the price of our common stock from per share as of september  to per share as of december   it appears that our market value after certain adjustments as discussed above may be less than our net book value as of december  if the price of our common stock and our market value were to remain at the same levels  or decline  such condition could result in future non cash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill and other intangible assets arising either from an interim impairment review as of december  or from our next scheduled recurring annual impairment review  as of september  we will closely monitor and evaluate all such factors as of december  and subsequent periods  in order to determine whether to record future non cash impairment charges
