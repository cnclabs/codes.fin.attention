item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and functional measurement  or fm  products 
we believe that these products enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular heart disease by improving the efficiency and efficacy of existing percutaneous interventional  or pci  therapy procedures in the coronary or peripheral arteries 
we market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
our products consist of multi modality consoles which are marketed as stand alone units or as customized units that can be integrated into a variety of hospital based interventional surgical suites called catheterization laboratories  or cath labs 
we have developed customized cath lab versions of these consoles and are developing additional functionality options as part of our cath lab integration initiative 
our consoles have been designed to serve as a multi modality platform for our phased array and rotational ivus catheters  fractional flow reserve  or ffr  pressure wires and medtronic s pioneer reentry device 
we are developing additional offerings for integration into the platform  including  forward looking ivus  or fl 
ivus  catheters  image guided therapy catheters and ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography  or oct  systems and catheters 
our ivus products include single procedure disposable phased array and rotational ivus imaging catheters and additional functionality options such as virtual histology  or vh  ivus tissue characterization and chromaflo stent apposition analysis 
our fm offerings include fm consoles and single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque enabling physicians to gauge the plaque s physiological impact on blood flow and pressure 
through axsun technologies  inc  or axsun  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  we also develop and manufacture optical monitors  laser and non laser light sources  and optical engines used in oct imaging systems as well as micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors used by telecommunications and other industrial companies 
we have corporate infrastructure in the us  europe and japan  direct sales capabilities in the us and south africa  and a combination of direct sales capabilities and distribution relationships in our primary international markets  including japan  europe  the middle east  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
our corporate office is located in san diego  california 
our worldwide manufacturing and research and development operations are located in rancho cordova  california 
we also have additional research and development facilities in cleveland  ohio  forsyth county  georgia and san diego  california 
we have sales offices in alpharetta  georgia and tokyo  japan  sales and distribution offices in zaventem  belgium and woodmead  south africa  and third party distribution facilities in chiba  japan and tokyo  japan 
in addition  we have facilities in billerica  massachusetts for the manufacturing and operations of axsun  our wholly owned subsidiary  and the research and development of oct and fl 
ivus technology 
during the first half of  we completed our restructuring plan to close our facility in san antonio  texas and consolidated our oct resources into our billerica  massachusetts facility 
in september  we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a series of agreements to acquire real property and to design and build manufacturing facilities in costa rica 
we have focused on building our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
at december   we had  employees worldwide  including manufacturing employees  sales and marketing employees and research and development 
table of contents employees 
we sell our products directly to customers in certain european markets and utilize distributors in other european markets  including spain  portugal and parts of italy 
beginning in the third quarter of  we primarily sell our products directly to customers in japan see recent developments  direct sales strategy in japan below 
we also have a direct contractual relationship with johnson johnson kk  cordis division  or johnson johnson  through which our ivus products are distributed in japan 
in certain markets  including the major markets of asia pacific  latin america  europe  australia  africa and the middle east  we have distributor relationships through which we sell our products 
our distributors are involved in product launch planning  education and training  physician support and clinical trial management 
at december   we had a worldwide installed base of over  consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
in the year ended december   the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues  a million  or increase from  in which the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues 
we manufacture our multi modality and fm consoles  ivus catheters and fm guide wires at our facility in rancho cordova  california 
we use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards and mechanical sub assemblies used in the manufacture of our consoles 
we also use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the manufacture of our single procedure disposable products 
we perform incoming inspection on these circuit boards  mechanical sub assemblies and components  assemble them into finished products  and test the final product to assure quality control 
on december   we acquired axsun technologies  inc  a company that develops and manufactures optical monitors for the telecommunications industry  laser and non laser light sources and optical engines used in medical oct imaging systems and advanced photonic components and sub systems used in spectroscopy and other industrial applications 
we believe axsun s proprietary oct technology will provide us competitive advantages in the invasive imaging sector 
in connection with the axsun acquisition  we and axsun were sued by lightlab imaging  inc  or lightlab 
lightlab was a wholly owned subsidiary of goodman company  ltd  which was a distributor of our ivus and fm products in japan until that relationship was terminated in july lightlab was acquired by st 
jude medical  inc  or st 
jude  on july  lightlab develops and sells oct products for cardiovascular imaging and other medical uses 
for details related to the litigation  see note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in and to million in our operating loss was million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the acquisition of novelis 
our operating loss increased to million in  which included an million charge related to in process research and development for a milestone of the cardiospectra acquisition and a million charge related to the accrual of a milestone payment related to the novelis acquisition 
in we had operating income of million  which included a reversal of the million charge related to the novelis milestone  as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
this is discussed in more detail in recent developments novelis milestone payment 
our operating results also included million in expenses resulting from the judgment related to our ongoing lightlab litigation discussed in more detail in note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation lightlab to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since our inception  is the first full fiscal year in which profitability was achieved 
in the years ended december   and    and  respectively  of our revenues and   and  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in various non us dollar currencies  primarily the euro and the yen 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses will continue to be denominated in non us dollar currencies 
as a result  we are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operating results in the future 

table of contents economic conditions have continued to deteriorate significantly in many countries and regions  including without limitation the us  japan  europe  middle east and africa  where we have generated most of our revenues 
these conditions may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
if our customers do not obtain or do not have access to the necessary capital to operate their businesses  or are otherwise adversely affected by the deterioration in national and worldwide economic conditions  this could result in reductions in the sales of our products  longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies by our customers  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  our customers and suppliers liquidity  capital resources and credit may be adversely affected by their relative ability or inability to obtain capital and credit  which could adversely affect our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and lengthen our collection cycles  or limit our timely access to important sources of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our consoles and catheters 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial or credit markets will improve the national and worldwide economic conditions in the near term 
recent developments plans to increase manufacturing capacity 
in september  we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a trust  land purchase and right of first refusal agreement  or purchase agreement  with zona franca coyol  sociedad anonima  or cfz  a costa rica stock corporation  and banco improsa  sociedad anonima  a costa rica stock corporation  as trustee  pursuant to which we will gain title to a parcel of land  or property  for which we paid million  for the purpose of constructing a manufacturing facility  and we will have a five year right of first refusal to purchase a parcel of land contiguous to the property 
the purchase price for such parcel will be for an amount not to exceed million for the land  and the construction costs for our shell building will be an amount not to exceed million 
in connection with the purchase agreement  we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  also entered into a fixed price building construction agreement for phase one  or construction agreement  for the design  planning  construction and administration of construction of our cold shell manufacturing building and exterior work on the property for million  of which was paid upon execution of the construction agreement  and the remainder of which will be paid over the eleven month construction period 
also  in connection with the purchase agreement  we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a design  architecture  engineering and construction management contract  pursuant to which cfz will act as the designer  planner and construction manager  as well as constructor and general contractor  for the completion of an operational manufacturing facility  including the addition of equipment and related improvements 
we expect the cost of these improvements to be approximately million and we will incur these costs during and early cfz will be paid on a cost plus basis whereby cfz shall perform or cause to be performed the work specified by us and cfz for the cost of work  plus a construction management fee and reimbursable costs 
fluid medical acquisition 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in fluid medical  inc  or fluid medical  a privately held company  which was engaged in the development of imaging technology for use in various structural heart applications  including  but not limited to  mitral valve repair 
fluid medical s technology and intellectual property provide forward field of view imaging on highly maneuverable catheters that have the potential to enable or enhance visualization for procedures currently done with inadequate imaging 
this technology is expected to result in a forward looking intra cardiac echo  or fl 
ice  catheter that will initially be focused on minimally invasive structural heart applications  such as percutaneous aortic and mitral valve therapies 
as we expand our line of visualization tools used in performing pcis we believe this technology will enhance our ability to provide a broad suite of visualization products to our customers 
the purchase price of million consisted of million in cash payments and  of debt forgiveness related to working capital loans we made to fluid medical prior to the acquisition 
we have retained  as a hold back liability to satisfy any claims for indemnification made within months following the closing 
assets acquired included million of in process research and development  or ipr d  which we recorded as an intangible asset   of fixed assets  and  of cash 
liabilities assumed consisted of  of accrued vacation 
additionally  we recorded a deferred tax liability of million related to the difference 
table of contents between the book and tax basis of the acquired assets 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination and  as such we recorded million of goodwill reflecting the amount by which the purchase consideration exceeded the acquired net assets 
we recorded  of acquisition related costs related to this transaction  which were recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended december  as selling  general and administrative expense 
convertible debt offering 
in september  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due september   or notes  in an offering registered under the securities act of  as amended 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on march and september  commencing on march  the notes are general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with our other existing and future unsecured obligations 
prior to june   the notes are convertible only upon certain specified events 
the initial conversion rate for the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  representing an initial effective conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the indenture governing the notes but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest 
we received proceeds of million from issuance of the notes  net of debt issuance costs million and net payments related to our hedge transactions million 
in connection with this hedge transaction  we purchased call options on our common stock from jpmorgan chase bank  national association  or jpmorgan chase 
in addition  to reduce the cost of the hedge  under separate transactions we sold warrants to jpmorgan chase 
we recorded total debt issuance costs including broker fees of approximately million  which have been allocated on a pro rata basis to the debt million and equity  components of the transaction 
the debt component is primarily included in non current liabilities and is being accreted to interest expense over five years  the term of the notes 
the equity component was netted against the proceeds and included in additional paid in capital 
direct sales strategy in japan 
historically  we sold our products in japan primarily through distributors 
during  we began to implement our direct sales strategy by terminating our relationship with our largest distributor in japan 
during the third quarter of  we continued to expand our direct sales strategy  including our efforts to place and sell our products directly through an internal sales force in japan 
on september   we entered into an agreement with fukuda denshi co  ltd  or fukuda  to terminate our distribution relationship 
the effective date of the termination  or the termination date  was november  under the terms of the agreement  as consideration for the early termination of the distribution agreement  we agreed to pay fukuda million japanese yen approximately million  or the termination payment  of which approximately  was paid in september  and the remainder was paid on the termination date 
the termination payment was capitalized as an intangible asset customer relationships and will be amortized over the remaining term of the distribution agreement 
in addition to the termination payment we purchased consoles owned by fukuda primarily placed in service at third party customer sites for million japanese yen approximately million  which represents the estimated fair value of these consoles 
this amount is capitalized within property and equipment  and is being depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
additionally  we expect to pay fukuda approximately million japanese yen approximately million  net of outstanding accounts receivable  for the purchase of disposables held by fukuda at termination date  that we agreed to repurchase 
for additional information regarding the risks associated with our direct sales strategy in japan  see risk factors 
reversal of accrual for novelis milestone payment 
under the terms of our merger agreement with novelis  a milestone payment of million was eligible to be earned by the novelis stockholders upon receipt of fda approval of a k application for the novelis fl 
ivus device  but only in the event that the k application for such a device was filed with the fda on or before december  at december  a k application had been made to the fda 
at that time  we believed that the k application would be approved and that the milestone would become payable 
accordingly  at december  we recorded an accrual for million in relation to the potential milestone payment 

table of contents based on our internal assessments in relation to our ongoing interactions with the fda regarding this k application  during the fourth quarter of it became apparent that our k application would not be approved prior to its expiration 
accordingly  we reversed the accrual for the milestone payment  resulting in a million credit to ipr d expense during the quarter 
financial operations overview the following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses 
revenues 
we derive our revenues from two reporting segments medical and industrial 
our medical segment represents our core business  in which we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our consoles and single procedure disposables 
our industrial segment derives revenues related to the sales of axsun s micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors to telecommunication and other industrial companies and sales of lasers to lightlab for use in its oct system 
in the year ended december   we generated million of revenues which is composed of million from our medical segment and million from our industrial segment 
we experienced increases in revenues related to ivus and fm single procedure disposables from compared with  while console sales remained relatively flat year over year 
in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our consoles  as compared with in the year ended december  in the year ended december   ivus single procedure disposables accounted for of our medical segment revenues  compared to in  while in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our fm single procedure disposables  as compared with in the year ended december  other revenues consist primarily of service and maintenance revenues  shipping and handling revenues  sales of distributed products  spare parts sales  and license fees 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our quarterly revenues from console sales due in part to the timing of hospital capital equipment purchasing decisions 
further  we expect variability of our revenues based on the timing of our new product introductions  which may cause our customers to delay their purchasing decisions until the new products are commercially available 
alternatively  we may include in our arrangements with customers future deliverables  such as unspecified hardware upgrades or training 
in these cases  we would be required to defer associated revenues from these customers until we have met our future deliverables obligation 
our medical segment sales in the us are generated by our direct sales representatives and our products are shipped to hospitals throughout the us from our facilities in rancho cordova  california and billerica  massachusetts 
our medical segment international sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and are shipped throughout the world from our facilities in rancho cordova  california  billerica  massachusetts  zaventem  belgium  chiba  japan  tokyo  japan  and woodmead  south africa 
our industrial segment sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and these products are shipped to telecommunications and other industrial companies domestically and abroad from our facility in billerica  massachusetts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs for the products that we sell and other costs associated with our manufacturing process  such as personnel costs  rent  depreciation and utilities 
in addition  cost of revenues includes depreciation of company owned consoles  royalty expenses for licensed technologies included in our products  service costs  provisions for warranty  distribution  freight and packaging costs and stock based compensation expense 
we expect our gross margin for ivus and fm products to improve over time if we are successful in our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve our manufacturing processes and increase production volumes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the sales  marketing  executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include travel and entertainment expenses  facility costs  
table of contents trade show  training and other promotional expenses  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock based compensation expense 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing efforts and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support our continued growth 
we expect these expenses to grow at a slower rate than our revenues as we plan to leverage these costs as we continue to grow our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  consultants  prototype materials  clinical studies  depreciation  regulatory filing fees  certain legal costs related to our intellectual property and stock based compensation expense 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products  technologies and applications 
amortization of intangibles 
we amortize intangible assets  consisting of our developed technology  licenses  customer relationships  assembled workforce and patents and trademarks  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives up to twenty years 
these assets are regularly tested for impairment and abandonment 
in process research and development 
in process research and development  or ipr d  consists of our projects acquired in connection with acquisitions that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of each acquisition date 
certain additional payments that may be required in connection with our acquisitions could result in future charges to ipr d 
in december  we acquired certain oct assets in connection with our acquisition of cardiospectra  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval remained to be completed as of the acquisition date at an estimated cost of million 
in december  we achieved a milestone specified in the cardiospectra merger agreement related to the receipt of ce mark regulatory approval and million became payable by us to the former stockholders of cardiospectra 
we paid such amount to the former stockholders of cardiospectra with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and  of cash 
although we have received ce mark approval for a preliminary version of our oct product  this version is not intended to be commercialized 
we believe there is significant incremental effort and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization and there is significant risk that a commercializable product may not result from our efforts 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to obtain a commercializable oct product for a total of approximately million 
the oct project was originally expected to be commercialized by late  however the oct project was at an earlier stage of development than our initial assessment indicated 
as of december   commercialization is not expected until additional milestone payments of up to million may be paid to the former stockholders of cardiospectra in connection with successful and timely regulatory approvals and sales milestones see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
if we are unable to launch an oct product in a timely manner  or at all  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize a potential competitive position  experience difficulties in obtaining our forecasted revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay some or all of the remaining milestone payments 
in may  we acquired the fl 
ivus project in connection with our acquisition of novelis  which was valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval protocols remained to be completed for the fl 
ivus project as of the acquisition date  at an estimated cost of million 
in december  we recorded million of additional ipr d expense related to our fl 
ivus program from novelis 
this represented a contractual milestone payment that was to be made to the former stockholders of novelis upon achievement of a regulatory milestone 
in december  we determined that we would no longer achieve the milestone and  
table of contents accordingly  we reversed the million charge recognized in the prior year 
we believe there are significant incremental efforts and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to commercialize the first product using fl 
ivus for a total of million 
we originally expected the fl 
ivus project to receive regulatory approvals and be commercialized during as of december   the project was expected to be completed in if the fl 
ivus project is not completed in a timely manner  or at all  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize our competitive position and experience a potential loss of revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay the milestone payment 
in august we acquired the forward looking intra cardiac echo fl 
ice project in connection with our acquistition of fluid 
this project was recorded as an intangible asset and was valued at million 
at the date of acquistition the estimated costs to complete were million 
at december  we estimated costs to complete would be approximately million 
in november  we acquired an ipr d project in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of impact medical technologies  llc  a minor acquisition  valued at approximately the following table summarizes our significant ipr d projects in millions as of acquisition date costs incurred since acquisition estimated cost to complete  as of december  total estimated costs to complete since acquisition date project name fair value estimated cost to complete oct fl

ice interest income 
interest income is comprised of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents and our short term and long term available for sale investments  or investments 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest expense related to our convertible debt including coupon interest  accretion of debt discount  and amortization of issuance costs  as well as interest expense related to our capital lease obligations 
exchange rate loss gain 
exchange rate loss gain is comprised of foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses  net  and the effect of changes in value and net settlements of our foreign exchange forward contracts 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes is comprised of foreign income taxes as well as various state and local income taxes 
we have evaluated our ability to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
for those jurisdictions in which we believe there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no current benefit has been recognized for net operating losses or other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established at december  and to reflect these uncertainties 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and our state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely 
we also have federal research and experimentation tax credits  which begin to expire in  and state research and experimentation tax credits  which carry forward indefinitely

comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to revenues of million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   revenues related to ivus single procedure disposables increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december   while revenues related to fm single procedure disposables increased million or in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues related to console sales in the year ended december  increased as compared to the year ended december   based on an increase in console unit sales 
overall  our revenue increases were driven by increased demand for our disposables  as well as higher revenues resulting from our direct sales efforts in japan 
additionally  the increases in fm disposable revenues were primarily due to the broader availability of ffr technology as this functionality has been incorporated into our multi modality console  in conjunction with an increased adoption of the technology based on clinical study data 
industrial segment revenues were million in the year ended december   compared to our industrial segment revenues of million in the year ended december   resulting from higher sales to our international telecommunications customers 
other revenues increased million  or  due primarily to higher service contract and rental revenues  partially offset by lower sales of distributed products 
increases in revenues were realized across all our key geographic markets 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   from million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the cost of revenues was primarily due to higher sales volume 
gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   up from of revenues in the year ended december  this gross margin improvement was primarily the result of favorable pricing from our transition to the direct sales model in japan  a decrease in the production costs of ivus and fm disposable products due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives  increased overhead recovery rates due to higher volumes  and lower warranty related costs 
these benefits were partially offset by increased depreciation costs from our console unit placement pool additions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our us  europe and japan sales organizations  including continued 
table of contents growth in our japan operation to support our direct sales efforts there  legal expenses related to our litigation matters  including the lightlab litigation and associated judgment of million which is discussed in more detail in note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation lightlab to our consolidated financial statements  increased infrastructure expenses to support company growth  higher stock based compensation expense  increased marketing expenses related to new product launches  and severance payments related to the resignation of two senior executives 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  was primarily due to increased spending on various new and existing product development projects  including oct and fl 
ivus and activities supporting other acquired technologies  and increased clinical and regulatory expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense decreased to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the decrease in amortization expense is primarily related to developed technology that we originally acquired from jomed  nv that was fully amortized as of december  partially offset by amortization expense related to developed technology acquired in february in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were a reduction of expenses of million  or of revenues in the year ended december  this primarily resulted from the reversal of an accrual for a milestone payment of million recognized in related to our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
ipr d expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to a milestone payment for our oct project acquired from cardiospectra and million related to the accrual of a milestone payment for our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average yield earned on our investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to our convertible debt financing which was completed in september interest expense during the year ended december  related to our convertible debt including coupon interest  accretion of debt discount  and amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on our capital lease obligations  while in the year ended december  interest expense was entirely related to our capital lease obligations 
exchange rate loss gain 
exchange rate loss for the year ended december  was  compared to an exchange rate gain of million in the year ended december  the gain in the year ended december  primarily related to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the yen and the related effect on the valuation of euro based monetary assets and liabilities held by volcano europe sa nv  or volcano europe 
in october  approximately million of intercompany receivable amounts owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan co 
ltd  or volcano japan  were converted to long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
in addition  in october  we implemented a hedging program to mitigate the volatility of our exchange rate gains and losses resulting from the translation of our intercompany receivable balances at current exchange rates 
during the year ended december   the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates was significantly reduced through our hedging practices 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the 
table of contents provision and the year over year increase were comprised primarily of taxes related to our japanese operations  while the year over year increase also included amounts related to state taxes

overall  our revenue increases were driven by an increase in the number of pcis performed  resulting in increased utilization of our single procedure disposable products 
additionally  the increases in fm disposable revenues were primarily due to the broader availability of ffr technology as this functionality has been incorporated into our multi modality console  in conjunction with an increased adoption of the technology based on recent clinical study data 
industrial segment revenues were million in the year ended december  we had  of industrial segment revenues in the year ended december  as we acquired axsun on december  other revenues increased million  or  due primarily to higher service contract and rental revenues and the inclusion of axsun medical segment revenues in the period  partially offset by lower sales of distributed products 
increases in revenues were realized across all our key geographic markets 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   from million  or of revenues in the year ended december  gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   down from of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the cost of revenues was primarily due to higher sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the addition of lower margin products from axsun  higher console depreciation and higher field service costs 
these unfavorable gross margin impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the production costs of ivus and fm disposable products due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives and higher manufacturing capacity utilization 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to growth in our japan operation to support our direct sales efforts there  increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our us and europe sales organizations  legal expenses related to the lightlab litigation  commission expenses related to the termination of our relationship with goodman  increased infrastructure expenses to support company growth  inclusion of a full year of expenses from ongoing operations of axsun and higher stock based compensation expense 
we acquired axsun in december   therefore the year ended december  did not include significant expenses related to axsun 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in due diligence expenses that were incurred in the year ended december  related to an acquisition that was not consummated

research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses from ongoing operations of novelis and axsun  increased personnel related costs  increased spending on various product development projects and increased clinical trial and regulatory expenses 
we acquired axsun in december 
table of contents  therefore the year ended december  did not include significant expenses related to axsun 
we acquired novelis in may  therefore the year ended december  included approximately seven months of expenses relating to novelis 
in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to a milestone of our oct project acquired from cardiospectra and million related to a milestone of our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis 
ipr d expenses were million  or of revenues in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to the acquisition of novelis 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense increased to million  or of revenues in the year ended december   as compared to million  or of revenues in the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired from axsun 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our investments and a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease was entirely due to a reduction in balances of our capital lease obligations 
interest expense during the years ended december  and primarily related to our capital lease obligations 
exchange rate gain 
exchange rate gain for the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the fluctuation of the euro and the yen relative to the us dollar and its related effect on the intercompany receivables between volcano corporation and volcano europe and volcano japan 
exchange rate gain was also favorably impacted by gains related to our foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of the hedging program we implemented during the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  compared to a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes consisted primarily of foreign income taxes and domestic state and local income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity historically  our sources of cash have included issuance of equity and debt securities  including underwritten public offerings of our common stock and convertible bonds  cash generated from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  cash generated from operations  primarily from product sales  and interest income 
our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development infrastructure and other working capital needs  
table of contents expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity and improving our manufacturing efficiency  capital expenditures related to the acquisition of equipment that we own and place at our customer premises and other fixed assets  cash used to repay our debt obligations and related interest expense  and cash used for acquisitions 
fluctuations in our working capital due to timing differences of our cash receipts and cash disbursements also impact our cash inflows and outflows 
prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations and acquisitions primarily through the issuances of million of preferred stock  million of senior subordinated notes and million of term loans 
these issuances of equity and debt were supplemented with borrowings from a revolving credit facility and equipment financing arrangements 
the issuances of our senior subordinated notes  term loans and revolving credit facility included warrants to purchase our common stock or series b preferred stock  which automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
we completed an underwritten initial public offering on june  that resulted in net proceeds of million  an underwritten follow on offering on december  that resulted in net proceeds of million  and an underwritten follow on offering on october  that resulted in net proceeds of million 
on september   we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes in an offering registered under the securities act of  as amended 
to hedge against potential dilution upon conversion of the notes  we purchased call options on our common stock from jpmorgan chase bank  national association  or jpmorgan chase 
in addition  to reduce the cost of the hedge  under separate transactions we sold warrants to jpmorgan chase 
we received proceeds of million from issuance of the notes  net of issuance costs million and net payments related to our hedge transactions million 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled million 
we invest our excess funds in short term and long term securities issued by corporations  banks  the us government  municipalities  and financial holding companies and in money market funds comprised of us treasury and agency securities 
we do not hold securities backed by mortgages 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since inception  we have generated significant operating losses and as a result we have not generated sufficient operating cash flow to fund our operations and the growth in our business 
during the year ended december   our business generated million in cash flows from operating activities

table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of million for reflected our net income of million  adjusted for non cash expenses  consisting primarily of million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation expense 
decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities million  and accrued compensation million also provided cash 
uses of cash included an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased sales  increased prepaid and other assets of million  and an adjustment for non cash expenses related to a decrease in ipr d expenses of million primarily due to the reversal of an accrual for a development milestone payment related to the novelis acquisition million 
cash used in operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million and non cash investment amortization of  in addition  uses of cash include increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and a decrease of accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increased sales volume and timing of cash receipts  the increase in inventory is due to anticipated increased sales volume and the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of disbursements 
these amounts were offset by benefits realized from non cash expenses consisting of in process research and development expense of million related to milestones of the cardiospectra and novelis acquisitions  depreciation and amortization of million and non cash stock compensation expense of million 
in addition  sources of cash include an increase in accrued compensation of million  primarily due to increased headcount and related accrued benefits  and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million primarily related to accrued commissions to goodman and accrued legal costs for the lightlab litigation 
cash provided by operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million  non cash investment accretion of  and a non cash gain on foreign exchange of million 
in addition  uses of cash include increases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increased sales volume and timing of cash receipts  the increase in inventory is due to anticipated increased sales volume and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to payments made for future expenses 
these amounts were offset by benefits realized from non cash expenses consisting of in process research and development expense of million related primarily to the acquisition of novelis  depreciation and amortization of million and non cash stock compensation expense of million 
in addition  sources of cash include accounts payable increases of million related to the increase in inventory and timing of payments  accrued compensation increases of million  primarily due to increased headcount and salary deferrals for the employee stock purchase plan  and deferred revenue increases of  cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million was used to purchase short term and long term available for sale securities and million was used for the purchases of long term assets  including capital expenditures for medical diagnostic equipment and manufacturing equipment 
additionally  we used million for the acquisition of fluid medical and million for the acquisition of other intangible assets  including purchased technology and costs of patents 
these purchases were partially offset by million from the sale or maturity of investments

cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the convertible debt and related hedge transactions  million from exercises of common stock options  and million from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from exercises of common stock options of million and proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million of proceeds from exercises of common stock options and proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
future liquidity needs our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to medical diagnostic equipment that we own and place at our customers premises  our facilities expansion needs  including costs of acquiring or leasing additional facilities and associated building costs or tenant improvements  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  upgrades to our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and improve overall productivity  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources in the us and abroad  particularly in japan where our strategy is to continue to pursue a direct sales model  the continued advancement of research and development activities  improvements to and increases in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  and acquisitions of technologies that enhance our capabilities or compliment our markets 
our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
at december   we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and our investments will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures including the expansion of our manufacturing operations into costa rica and the implementation of a new enterprise resource management system  and operations for at least the next months 
we intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of any future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital required to support our sales 
table of contents growth  funds required to service our debt  the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  our sales and marketing programs  our need for infrastructure to support our sales growth  the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies and changes in the market and regulatory environment and cash that may be required to settle our foreign currency hedges 
our ability to fund our longer term cash needs is subject to various risks  many of which are beyond our control see risk factors we may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
should we require additional funding  such as additional capital investments  we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income if we remain profitable 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  use of net operating loss carryforwards related to acquisitions of approximately million may be limited 
we expect to utilize our available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations in the event we are successful in maintaining continued profitability 
however  future limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other minimum state taxes may increase our overall tax obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification to business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
at december   we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
in october  we signed a clinical research support agreement with a third party in which the third party will conduct clinical studies concerning drug eluting stents 
we have agreed to provide a total of million to fund clinical study activities 
at december   we have a remaining obligation of up to million and we will be billed as services are performed under the agreement 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with other third parties to sponsor clinical studies 
generally  we contract with one or more clinical research sites for a single study and no one agreement is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we are usually billed as services are performed based on enrollment and are required to make payments over periods ranging from less than one year up to three years 
our actual payments under these agreements will vary based on enrollment 
at december   we estimate our contractual obligations related to these clinical studies are approximately million over the next three years 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments that are not reflected in our balance sheet at december  for each of the periods indicated in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations and commercial commitments capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase commitments commitments for construction of costa rica facility total 
table of contents we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in the us as well as locations in europe and asia 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases at december  consists of non cancelable commitments primarily for the purchase of production materials 
the table above does not include milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million which may be due to the former shareholders of cardiospectra see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements upon the achievement of certain milestones and may  at our election  be payable in either cash or stock  and up to an estimated million in payments for clinical studies which are billed as services are performed see above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the terms of which are generally free on board shipping point 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we prospectively adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu  on january  we have applied asu to our revenue arrangements containing multiple deliverables that were entered into or significantly modified on or after january  these deliverables can consist of consoles  options for the console  single procedure disposable products  service and maintenance agreements  biomedical equipment education and exchange rights for alternative platforms of our product functionality 
as a result of adopting asu  we have identified additional separate units of accounting related to options for our consoles  biomedical equipment education and exchange rights for alternative platforms of our product functionality 
we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables 
selling prices are determined using fair value  when available  or our estimate of selling price when fair value is not available for a given unit of accounting 
significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends  a customer s geographic location and the 
table of contents expected gross margins by product line 
prior to the adoption of asu  we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when we had not established fair value of delivered items and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 
typically  we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting upon delivery of the item and complete all obligations under an arrangement with multiple deliverables within one year 
we occasionally enter into agreements requiring cash payments to partners who are also customers 
we apply the provisions of asc topic  customer payments and incentives  to account for cash payments made under these agreements 
this typically results in a reduction of revenue for such payments 
fair value we record our investments at fair value 
at december   our cash and investments totaled million 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note financial statement details to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
valuations using level and inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation 
we utilize a third party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments 
while pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models  the inputs used are based on observable market information  therefore we have classified our inputs as level and level we do not value any of our investments using level inputs 
we also record our foreign exchange forward contracts at fair value 
at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts of  was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we classified these fair value inputs as level inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to obsolescence  potential expiration of raw materials and reductions in estimated future demand 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are generally three to five years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  which is generally between three and ten years 
the straight line method is used for depreciation and amortization 
intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology  customer relationships  licenses  and patents and trademarks  which are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to ten years  representing the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on our new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the legal life of the patent or the product s estimated useful life  up to twenty years 
acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
we believe the useful lives we assigned to these assets are reasonable 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
intangible assets  consisting of developed technology  licenses  customer relationships  assembled workforce  patents and trademarks  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives up to twenty years 
purchased ipr d is also capitalized 
amortization begins upon completion of a commercializable product and continues over the life of the product 
these assets are regularly tested for impairment and abandonment 
asc requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
we conduct our assessment on october of each year 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
acquisitions which cause us to recognize goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations that involve estimates and judgments about the value and recoverability of those assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value 
if less than their carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to long lived assets require us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated which requires significant judgment 
actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
foreign currency translation on july   we adopted the japanese yen as the functional currency for volcano japan 
consistent with the considerations specified in fasb asc topic  foreign currency matters  or asc  the change was made to reflect recent developments with our japan operations  including increases in direct sales denominated in the japanese yen and growth in the local infrastructure that has enabled the day to day operations of volcano japan to become relatively self contained and integrated into the japanese economic environment 
in accordance with asc  assets and liabilities of volcano japan s operations are translated into us dollars at period end exchange rates  revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period and adjustments resulting from the translation are reported on our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
due to the complexities and variability of foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and japanese yen  we are not able to estimate the financial effect this change will have on our future results of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight line method 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock based compensation expense 
we have used the black scholes model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected option life 
if we had made different assumptions  the amount of our deferred stock based compensation  stock based compensation expense  gross margin  net income loss and net income loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions to determine the fair value of our common stock and that deferred stock based compensation and related amortization were recorded properly for accounting purposes 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
for example  we granted stock options for  shares of our common stock during the year ended december  using our assumptions  we calculated approximately million of stock compensation expense related to these awards that will be amortized over four years 
given a ten percent change in our volatility assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately million 
given a one hundred basis point change in our risk free interest rate assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately million 
given a one year change in our expected option life assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately million 
in addition  given a one hundred basis point change in our weighted average forfeiture rate assumption  our stock compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  would have differed by approximately  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the realization of our deferred tax assets  which had a gross carrying value of million at december   is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
within the us and selected international jurisdictions  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our past and future performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of tax attributes in the past  and the length of carryforward periods and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance in the us and selected international jurisdictions until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable in the respective jurisdictions 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic which updates the guidance in asc topic  subsequent events  to no longer require companies that file with the sec to indicate the date through which they have analyzed subsequent events 
this updated guidance became effective immediately upon issuance 
in december  the fasb issued asupdate no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test so that for those reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not based on an assessment of qualitative indicators that goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments as well as our convertible debt which has a fixed rate 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments of which million consisted of highly liquid financial investments with original final maturities of one year or less and the remaining amount was long term available for sale investments with original final maturities over one year 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments  the impact of an increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in our annual interest income of approximately  from these investments 
we invest in cash and cash equivalents and investments in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields consistent with our tolerance for investment risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
we do not hold mortgage backed securities 
due to the generally short term nature of the majority of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european and japanese operations 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
during the year ended december   and of our revenues were denominated in the euro and yen  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in the euro and of our operating expenses were denominated in the yen 
during the year ended december   revenues were unfavorably impacted by the valuation of the euro and favorably impacted by the valuation of the yen  as compared to the us dollar 
in periods of a strengthening us dollar  our results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods could be negatively impacted 
exchange rate fluctuations resulting from the translation of the inter company balances between volcano corporation  our us entity  and volcano japan  and volcano corporation and volcano europe  and other non us dollar denominated liabilities into non us dollars are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses and are included in exchange rate gain in the consolidated statement of operations 
on october   approximately million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan was converted into a long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
in april  million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano europe was converted into equity  resulting in a decrease in the amount of euro based receivables being marked to market 
these conversions thereby reduce the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations in our consolidated statements of operations 
through september   we did not engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exchange risk 
commencing october  we began using foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the yen and the euro 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one year or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts used to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as these transactions have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
these contracts effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
these contracts contain net settlement features 
if we experience unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  we may be required to use material amounts of cash to settle the transactions which may adversely affect the operating results that we report with respect to the corresponding period 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded exchange rate losses of million and exchange rate gains of  respectively  related to our foreign exchange forward contracts 
we had no gains or losses related to foreign exchange forward contracts in we currently hold foreign exchange forward contracts with a single counterparty 
the bank counterparty in these contracts exposes us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum credit quality guidelines 
in addition  our exposure in the event of a default by our counterparty is limited to the changes in value of our hedged balances 
at december   we were in a net liability position with our counterparty for  market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce the potential equity dilution  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the hedge entitling us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at an initial stock price of per share  each of which is subject to adjustment 
upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  the hedge is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock 
table of contents exceeds the strike price of the hedge 
we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the hedge entitling them to acquire up to million shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  at an initial strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period the quarter or year to date period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants
