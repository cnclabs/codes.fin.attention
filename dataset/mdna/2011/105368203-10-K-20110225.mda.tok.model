item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december   we manage our portfolio within seven segments pennsylvania suburbs  philadelphia cbd  metropolitan washington d 
c  new jersey delaware  richmond  virginia  austin  texas and california 
the pennsylvania suburbs segment includes properties in chester  delaware  and montgomery counties in the philadelphia suburbs 
the philadelphia cbd segment includes properties located in the city of philadelphia in pennsylvania 
the metropolitan washington  dc segment includes properties in northern virginia and suburban maryland 
the new jersey delaware segment includes properties in burlington  camden and mercer counties and in new castle county in the state of delaware 
the richmond  virginia segment includes properties primarily in albemarle  chesterfield  goochland and henrico counties and durham  north carolina 
the austin  texas segment includes properties in austin 
the california segment includes properties in oakland  concord  carlsbad and rancho bernardo 
we generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates  costs of tenant improvements  tenant creditworthiness  current and expected operating costs  the length of the lease  vacancy levels and demand for office and industrial space 
we also generate cash through sales of assets  including assets that we do not view as core to our portfolio  either because of location or expected growth potential  and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors 
factors that may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the us  market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging  characterized by tighter credit conditions and slower growth 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued volatility in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants  to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
real estate asset valuation general economic conditions and the resulting impact on market conditions or a downturn in tenants businesses may adversely affect the value of our assets 
significantly challenging economic conditions in the us  declining demand for leased office  mixed use  or industrial properties and or a decrease in market rental rates and or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets could have a negative impact on the value of our assets  including the value of our properties and related tenant improvements 
if we were required under gaap to write down the carrying value of any of our properties to the lower of cost or fair value due to impairment  or if as a result of an early lease termination we were required to remove or dispose of material amounts of tenant improvements that are not reusable to another tenant  our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected 

table of contents leasing activity and rental rates the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space  newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 
development and redevelopment programs historically  a significant portion of our growth has come from our development and redevelopment efforts 
we have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size  timing  costs and scope of our development and redevelopment programs and  as necessary  scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our strategic submarkets 
given the economic conditions  we do not intend to commence new development or redevelopment projects in the near future 
we believe that a portion of our future potential growth will continue to come from our newly developed or redeveloped properties once current economic conditions normalize 
however  we anticipate that the general economic conditions and the resulting impact on conditions in our core markets will delay timing and reduce the scope of our development program in the near future  which will further impact the average development and redevelopment asset balances qualifying for interest and other carry cost capitalization 
we cease capitalizing such costs once a project does not qualify for interest and other carry cost capitalization under gaap 
in addition  we may be unable to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected timeframes or complete development or redevelopment properties on schedule or within budgeted amounts  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
financial and operating performance our financial and operating performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets  our leasing results  our acquisition  disposition and development activity  our financing activity  our cash requirements and economic and market conditions  including prevailing interest rates 
in seeking to increase revenue through our operating  financing and investment activities  we also seek to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risks that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  and that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases  at anticipated rental rates  or if tenants terminate their leases early  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  if economic conditions persist or deteriorate further  we may experience increases in past due accounts  defaults  lower occupancy and reduced effective rents 
this condition would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents development risk at december   we were redeveloping one garage project located in philadelphia with total projected costs of million of which million then remained to be funded 
in addition  we were completing the lease up of five recently completed developments  aggregating million square feet  for which we expect to spend an additional million in we are actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants but can provide no assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of space at these projects 
as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land 
as market conditions warrant  we will seek to opportunistically dispose of those parcels that we do not anticipate developing 
for the parcels of land that we ultimately develop  we will be subject to risks associated with development of this land including construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates  building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
lease incentives  which are included as reductions of rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
for certain leases in the portfolio  there are significant assumptions and judgments made by management in determining the lease term such as when termination options are provided to the tenant 
the lease term impacts the period over which minimum rents are determined and recorded and also considers the period over which lease related costs are amortized 
in addition  our rental revenue is impacted by our determination of whether the improvements made by us or the tenant are landlord assets 
the determination of whether an asset is a landlord asset requires judgment and principally considers whether improvements would be utilizable by another tenant upon move out by the existing tenant 
to the extent they are determined not to be landlord assets  and we fund them  they are considered as lease incentives 
to the extent the tenant funds the improvements that we consider to be landlord assets  we treat them as deferred revenue which is amortized to revenue over the lease term 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and constructions costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs during the period of development 
estimates and judgments are required in determining when capitalization of certain costs such as interest should commence and cease 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets 

table of contents real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this accounting standard requires significant use of judgments and estimates in determining its application 
if the entity is not deemed to be a vie  and we serve as the general partner within the entity  we evaluate to determine if our presumed control as the general partner is overcome by the kick out rights and other substantive participating rights of the limited partners in accordance with the same accounting standard 
we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary ii entities that are non vies which we do not control  but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and iii entities that are non vies which we control through our general partner status  but the limited partners in the entity have the substantive ability to dissolve the entity or remove us without cause or have substantive participating rights 
we continuously assess our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is  and whether or not the limited partners in an entity have substantive rights  more particularly if certain events occur that are likely to cause a change in original determinations 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
our estimates of value for each investment particularly in commercial real estate joint ventures are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and operating costs 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  accordingly  the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized 
our broadmoor joint venture owns an office park in austin  texas which is currently leased to a single tenant who is also a partner in the joint venture 
the said tenant is also the owner of the land which the joint venture currently leases under an existing ground lease agreement 
the office buildings lease renewals are currently under negotiation 
given the current circumstances  we have performed an impairment assessment of our investment in the venture using probability weighted scenarios that include varying outcomes 
we believe that a market participant would assess the probabilities of these outcomes in the same fashion 
in evaluating the scenarios  we have determined that the fair value of our investment marginally exceeded its carrying value and the investment is not impaired at december  however  given the lease has not yet been executed and the negotiations of specific terms of the lease are ongoing  the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could cause an impairment of our investment that could be material 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of the investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
there are also operating properties evaluated as they have been identified for potential sale 
no impairment was determined  however  if actual cashflows or the estimated holding periods change  an impairment could be recorded in the future and it could be material 
although our strategy is generally to hold our properties over the long term  we will dispose of properties to meet our liquidity needs or for other strategic needs 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred and the assets are classified as held and used  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 

table of contents where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
at december   we performed an impairment assessment of our land holdings as management determined that a sale scenario was the most likely source of future cash flows for certain of the land parcels aggregating to total cost of million which is included in land inventory 
this impairment assessment required management to estimate the expected proceeds from sale at some point in the future  to determine whether an impairment was indicated 
this estimate requires significant judgment 
if our expectations as to the expected sales proceeds  or timing of the anticipated sale change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment could be different and such differences could be material 
during our impairment review for  we determined that no impairment charges were necessary 
during the first quarter of  we determined that one of our properties  during our testing for impairment under the held and used model  had a historical cost greater than the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  an impairment on the property of million was recorded to reduce its carrying value to an amount equal to management s estimate of the then current fair value 
we sold this property in the second quarter of we also recorded a million impairment charge on properties designated as held for sale at june   and sold these properties during the fourth quarter of we also entered into development agreements related to our two parcels of land under option for ground lease that require us to commence development by december  if we determine that we will not be able to start the construction by the date specified  or if we determine development is not in our best economic interest and an extension of the development period cannot be negotiated  we will have to write off all costs that we have incurred in preparing these parcels of land for development amounting to million as of december  income taxes parent company the parent company has elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition  the parent company has several subsidiary reits 
in order to continue to qualify as a reit  the parent company and each of its reit subsidiaries are required to  among other things  distribute at least of their reit taxable income to their stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets 
as reits  the parent company and its reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of their income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the operations of these reits 
the parent company and its reit subsidiaries intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows them to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as reits 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the parent company or one of its reit subsidiaries were to fail to meet these requirements  they would be subject to federal income tax 
the parent company may elect to treat one or more of its subsidiaries as a trs 
in general  a trs may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
the parent company has elected to treat certain of its corporate subsidiaries as trss  these entities provide third party property management services and certain services to tenants that could not otherwise be provided 
operating partnership in general  the operating partnership is not subject to federal and state income taxes  and accordingly  no provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the partners of the operating partnership are required to include their respective share of the operating partnership s profits or losses in their respective tax returns 
the operating partnership s tax returns and the amount of allocable partnership profits and losses are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities 
if such examination results in changes to the operating partnership profits or losses  then the tax liability of the partners would be changed accordingly 

table of contents the operating partnership has elected to treat several of its subsidiaries as reits under sections through of the code 
each subsidiary reit has met the requirements for treatment as a reit under sections through of the code  and  accordingly  no provision has been made for federal and state income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if any subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  that subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years 
also  each subsidiary reit may be subject to certain local income taxes 
the operating partnership has elected to treat several of its subsidiaries as taxable trss  which are subject to federal  state and local income tax 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
for accrued rent receivables  we consider the results of the evaluation of specific accounts as well as other factors including assigning risk factors to different industries based on our tenants sic classification 
considering various factors including assigning a risk factor to different industries  these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience adjusted for current market conditions 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs  particularly internal costs  meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term on a basis that approximates the effective interest method while capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease includes the below market fixed renewal period  if applicable 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 

table of contents other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and any fixed rate bargain renewal periods 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors that we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 
characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease prior to the end of the lease term  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same store property portfolio and the total portfolio 
the same store property portfolio consists of properties containing an aggregate of approximately million net rentable square feet that we owned for the entire twelve month periods ended december  and this table also includes a reconciliation from the same store property portfolio to the total portfolio net income ie  all properties owned by us during the twelve month periods ended december  and by providing information for the properties which were acquired  under development including lease up assets or placed into service and administrative elimination information for the twelve month periods ended december  and in thousands

table of contents total revenue cash rents from the total portfolio decreased by million from to  primarily reflecting decrease of million of rental income at the same store portfolio as a result of the decrease in same store occupancy of basis points  decrease of million due to the deconsolidation of three of our real estate ventures as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities beginning january  during the first quarter of this standard does not require retrospective adoption  decrease of million of rental income due to the decrease in occupancy at three redevelopment properties that we recently placed in service  and an offsetting increase of million of rental income due to our acquisition of three logan square and the completion and placement in service of the irs philadelphia campus and the cira south garage during the third quarter of straight line rents at the total portfolio increased by million due to million of straight line rents from the acquisition of three logan square during the third quarter of the remainder of the increase is due to leases that commenced during the year of with free rent periods at our same store properties and at one of our redevelopment properties 
tenant reimbursements increased by million from to primarily due to the significant number of leases which includes base year operating expense recovery calculations that reached their base year amounts quicker in than in lease structure  the significant northeast snowfall expenses in the first quarter of  as well as the deferral to later months and timing of the repairs and maintenance expenses in the second quarter of  resulted in the base year leases achieving their base year amounts earlier in than in this is consistent with the increase in property operating expenses 
termination fees at the total portfolio increased million from to is mainly due to increased tenant move outs during which is consistent with the decrease in occupancy noted above 
third party management fees  labor reimbursement and leasing decreased by million from to mainly due to the termination of third party management contracts during the course of totaling million square feet 
this is consistent with the decrease in third party management fees 
this decrease was off set by the company no longer eliminating third party management fee income related to two of our real estate ventures of million in other income other income increased by million mainly as a result of additional construction management fee income of million from our agreement with the gsa relating to the irs philadelphia campus 
in addition  we received million of proceeds from bankruptcy settlements with two of our former tenants and million from a new energy efficiency rebate program in property operating expenses property operating expenses increased by million mainly due to our acquisition of three logan square and the completion and placement in service of the irs philadelphia campus and the cira south garage during the third quarter of totaling million of additional expenses 
in addition  we incurred higher snow removal and repairs and maintenance expenses totaling million during compared to this net increase was off set by a decrease of million in bad debt expense during as compared to real estate taxes real estate taxes decreased by million mainly due to lower taxes assessed on our properties during compared to and refunds related to prior years  offset by additional real estate taxes due to our acquisition of three logan square during the third quarter of 
table of contents general administrative expenses general and administrative expense increased by million primarily due to an increase of million in amortization of stock based compensation as a result of stock option and restricted stock performance units granted in march  an increase of million in salaries  bonus and recruiting fees due to new hires during  a million one time bonus payment made during  and a net increase of million as a result of various corporate level expenses during  none of which were individually significant  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million from to  primarily due to our depreciation and amortization expense on assets placed in service since  particularly three logan square and the irs philadelphia campus which totaled million of depreciation and amortization expense 
during  we also recorded million of depreciation related to and prior years principally with respect to completed projects that were not closed out of our job cost system timely 
this net increase was off set by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from assets written off related to early move outs and fully amortized assets when comparing to provision for impairment on real estate during our first quarter impairment review  we determined that one of the properties tested for impairment under the held and used model had a historical cost greater than the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  the recorded amount was reduced to an amount based on management s estimate of its fair value 
where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense of million is primarily due to the following a decrease of million resulting from our buybacks of various unsecured notes subsequent to the details of the various purchases completed during are noted in the loss gain on early extinguishment of debt section below  a decrease of million resulting from the pay off of an unsecured note at maturity during the fourth quarter of  a decrease of million resulting from lower weighted average interest rates on our million term loan and our three preferred trust borrowings 
such borrowings have variable interest rates and a portion of such borrowings are swaps which matured early in the quarters  and an increase of million in capitalized interest as a result of the increase in cumulative spending on development projects in compared to 
table of contents the above described decrease of million was offset by an increase of million from the sale of million of unsecured notes in the third quarter of and a net increase of million resulting from a higher outstanding mortgage notes payable balance as of december  compared to december  we also had an increase of million in interest expense related to the interest accretion of the two logan square million future liability expected to be settled in 
in addition  there was an increase of million in interest expense related to the estimated equity interest payments as a result of our partnership in the irs philadelphia campus 
deferred financing costs decreased by million mainly due to the acceleration of such expenses incurred from greater debt repurchase activities during the compared to the offset by deferred financing costs amortized relating to the forward financing on the irs philadelphia campus and cira south garage 
recognized hedge activity during  we recorded a million mark to market adjustment relating to two of our swaps that were applied to our september offering of million senior unsecured notes due the swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting upon completion of this offering as the hedging relationship was terminated 
accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the swaps were reflected in our statement of operations until they were settled in cash in december we paid million to terminate these swaps 
we also recorded a net million of income related to the write off of aoci and the ineffective portion of certain of our hedges 
equity in income of real estate ventures the increase in equity in income of real estate ventures of million from to is mainly due to a distribution in of million of sales proceeds that were held in escrow until resolution of certain contingencies arising from the sale of the property held by the five tower bridge partnership 
the remainder of the increase is the result of normal operating activities at the partnership level  and includes million of preferred return pick up from our ownership in a newly created real estate venture with thomas properties group commerce square 
gain loss on early extinguishment of debt during  we repurchased i million of our million exchangeable notes  ii million of our million guaranteed notes due and iii million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
the net loss was off set by a gain from the write off of the remaining premium on the pmec note at the time of pay off of million resulting in an aggregate net loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during  we repurchased million of our million exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
the gain on early extinguishment of debt is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments 
discontinued operations during  we sold one property in richmond  va  one property in exton  pa  one property in king of prussia  pa  one property in austin  tx  and four properties in marlton  nj 
these properties had total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and gain on sale of million 
the december  amounts are reclassified to include the operations of the properties sold during the twelve months period ended december   as well as all properties that were sold through the year ended december  therefore  the discontinued operations amount for the twelve months period ended december  includes total revenue of million  operating expenses of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million 
during the  we also recognized a provision for impairment of million on a property that was sold during the second quarter of 
table of contents net income net income decreased by million from the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
net income is significantly impacted by depreciation of operating properties and amortization of acquired intangibles 
these non cash charges do not directly affect our ability to pay dividends 
such charges can be expected to continue until lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated duration of the tenant relationship 
earnings per common share loss per share basic and diluted were for the twelve month period ended december  as compared to loss per share of for the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
the increase in the average number of common shares outstanding is primarily due to the commencement of the continuous equity offering program in march and the result of the million public equity offering of  shares during the second quarter of

table of contents total revenue cash rents from the total portfolio increased by million from to  primarily reflecting an additional million from four development redevelopment properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to an additional million of rental income due to increased occupancy at nine development redevelopment properties in in comparison to the increase was offset by the decrease of million of rental income at our same store properties from to due to a decrease in occupancy of basis points 
straight line rents at the total portfolio decreased by million primarily due to free rent converting to cash rent during tenant reimbursements increased by million from to primarily due to the increase in property operating expenses at our same store portfolio 
tenant reimbursements increased by million at our same store portfolio and the property operating expenses including real estate taxes at those properties increased by million 
the decrease in termination fees of million from to is mainly due to the recognition of a million termination fee from one tenant during in comparison to a million termination fee received from one tenant at one of redevelopment properties and a million termination fee received from one tenant at one of our same store properties in third party management fees  labor reimbursement and leasing decreased by million from to as a result of the termination of the management fee contract on march  that we entered into when we sold the office properties located in reading and harrisburg  pa 
as the contract was terminated early  approximately million of unamortized deferred management fees were taken into income during the decrease also resulted from the termination of other third party management contracts totaling million square feet subsequent to property operating expenses property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  at the total portfolio increased by million due to increased repairs and maintenance expenses along with increased snow removal expenses during compared to we also incurred an additional million of expenses from four properties that we completed and placed in service subsequent to these increases were offset by a decrease in the bad debt expense of million from to general administrative expenses general administrative expenses decreased by million from to mainly due to the severance costs of million in that we did not have in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million from to  primarily due to million of depreciation and amortization expense recorded on the four properties completed and placed in service subsequent to an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense was recorded on portions of the nine development properties that were placed in service subsequent to the increase was offset by the decrease of million at the same store portfolio for asset write offs related to early move outs and fully amortized assets when comparing to interest income expense interest income increased by approximately million  mainly due to the accretion of the million non interest bearing note receivable from the sale of the five northern california properties in the fourth quarter of the note receivable was recorded at its present value on the date of sale of million 
during  we recognized million of interest income related to this note receivable and million of interest income related to the million note receivable from the sale of the two trenton properties during the fourth quarter of during  we recognized million of interest income related to the note receivable from the sale of the five northern california properties and million of interest income received from a certificate of deposit investment 

table of contents the decrease in interest expense of million is mainly due to the following decrease of million resulting from the payoff at maturity of our million private placement notes in december decrease of million resulting from a lower average credit facility balance at the end of and a lower weighted average interest rate on such borrowings in compared to december  decrease of million resulting from lower weighted average interest rates on our million bank term loan and our three preferred trust borrowings 
such borrowings have variable interest rates and a portion of such borrowings are swapped to fixed rate debt through our hedging program 
this decrease is offset by an increase of million paid under these hedges since the variable interest rates on such debt is lower than the swapped fixed rate on the hedges assigned to these borrowings 
decrease of million resulting from our buybacks of unsecured notes in the details of the repurchases completed during the twelve months ended december  and are noted in the gain on early extinguishment of debt section below 
this decrease is offset by an increase of million of interest on issuance of new notes 
the above explained net decrease of million is offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of million as a result of the decrease in the average balance  on open development and redevelopment projects  million of interest expense related to our tax credit transactions  and an increase of million from a higher outstanding mortgage notes payable balance as of december  compared to december  amortization of deferred financing costs increased by million due to the acceleration of such expenses incurred in the debt repurchase activities of provision for impairment on land inventory as part of our review of long lived assets in accordance with the accounting standard for long lived assets  during the quarter ending december   management determined that certain of the parcels in our land inventory considered at that time more likely to be sold had historical carrying values in excess of the current estimate of their fair value 
our impairment was recorded based on management s estimate of the current fair value of the land inventory at that time 
provision for impairment on real estate during the quarter ended march  impairment review  we determined that one of the properties tested for impairment under the held and used model had a historical cost greater than the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  the recorded amount was reduced to an amount based on management s estimate of the current fair value 
during the nine months period ended september   we recorded a provision of million for impairment relating to the sale of the five northern california properties classifies as held for sale 
where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
recognized hedge activity during  we recorded a million mark to market adjustment relating to two of our swaps that were applied to our offering of million senior unsecured notes due completed in september the swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting upon completion of this offering as the hedging relationship was terminated 
accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the swaps were reflected in our statement of operations until they were cash settled in december we paid million to terminate these swaps 
during the year  we also recorded a net million of income related to the write off of aoci and the ineffective portion of certain of our hedges 

table of contents equity in income of real estate ventures the decrease in equity in income of real estate venture from to was mainly due to a payout of million that we received for our interest in a real estate venture that was sold during the fourth quarter of the remainder of the decrease is primarily attributable to lower net income at the real estate venture properties 
gain on early extinguishment of debt during  we repurchased million of our million exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
the gain on early extinguishment of debt is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments 
during  we repurchased million of our million guaranteed exchangeable notes  million of our million guaranteed notes due and million of our million guaranteed notes due which resulted in an million gain that we reported for the early extinguishment of debt 
the gain on extinguishment of debt has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our adoption of the new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments 
discontinued operations during the twelve month period ended december   we sold two properties in exton  pa  one property in moorestown  nj  one property in bethesda  md  two properties in trenton  nj and a condominium unit and an undivided interest in an office building in lawrenceville  nj 
these properties had total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and gain on sale of million 
we determined that the sale of the two properties in trenton  nj should be accounted for using the installment sale method 
as a result  we deferred the portion of the gain which exceeded the calculated gain following the installment sale method 
these amounts will decrease in proportion with the paydown of the principal balance on our note receivable from the buyer of the properties 
the buyer is not obligated to make any principal payments over the next seven years 
if they do make principal payments in advance  a portion of these amounts that are deferred will be recognized as a gain on sale in the period that we receive the cash for the principal payments 
we also recorded a million loss provision during the first quarter of in connection with the property in bethesda  md sold during the second quarter of which reduced our income from discontinued operations 
the december  amounts are reclassified to include the operations of the properties sold during the twelve months period ended december   as well as all properties that were sold through the year ended december  therefore  the discontinued operations amount for the twelve months period ended december  includes total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  interest expense of million and gains on sale of million 
we also recorded a million loss provision in connection with the five northern california properties classified as held for sale during the second quarter of which reduced our income from discontinued operations 
net income net income decreased by million from the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
net income is significantly impacted by depreciation of operating properties and amortization of acquired intangibles 
these non cash charges do not directly affect our ability to pay dividends 
such charges can be expected to continue until lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated duration of the tenant relationship 
earnings per common share loss per share basic and diluted were for the twelve month period ended december  as compared to earnings per share of for the twelve month period ended december  as a result of the factors described above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
the increase in the average number of common shares outstanding is primarily the result of a million public equity offering of  shares during the second quarter of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources of the parent company the parent company conducts its business through the operating partnership and its only material asset is its ownership of the partnership interests of the operating partnership 
the parent company  other than acting as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  issues public equity from time to time and guarantees the debt obligations of the operating partnership 
the parent company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock 
the parent company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is the distributions it receives from the operating partnership 
as of december   the parent company owned a interest in the operating partnership 
the remaining interest consists of common units of limited partnership interest owned by non affiliated investors 
as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  the parent company has full and complete authority over the operating partnership s day to day operations and management 
the parent company s principal source of capital is from the distributions it receives from the operating partnership 
the parent company believes that the operating partnership s sources of working capital  particularly its cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its credit facility  are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the parent company  which in turn will enable the parent company to make dividend payments to its stockholders 
the parent company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time  but is required by the operating partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of the operating partnership 
the parent company s ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company as a whole and the current trading price of its shares 
the parent company regularly analyzes which source of capital is most advantageous to it at any particular point in time 
in march  the parent company commenced a continuous equity offering program  under which it may sell up to an aggregate amount of  common shares until march  in amounts and at times to be determined by the parent company 
actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the parent company  including market conditions  the trading price of its common shares and determinations by the parent company of the appropriate sources of funding 
in conjunction with the offering program  the parent company engaged sales agents who received compensation  in aggregate  of up to of the gross sales price per share sold during the twelve months ended december  through december   the parent company sold  shares under this program at an average sales price of per share resulting in net proceeds of million 
the parent company contributed the net proceeds from the sales to the operating partnership 
on december   the parent company declared a distribution of per common share  totaling million  which it paid on january  to its shareholders of record as of january  in addition  the parent company declared distributions on its series c preferred shares and series d preferred shares to holders of record as of december  these shares are entitled to a preferential return of and  respectively 
distributions paid on january  to holders of series c preferred shares and series d preferred shares totaled million and million  respectively 
the parent company also maintains a share repurchase program under which its board of trustees has authorized the parent company to repurchase its common shares from time to time 
as of december   there were approximately million shares remaining to be repurchased under this program 
the parent company s board of trustees has not limited the duration of the program  however  it may be terminated at any time 
together with the operating partnership  the parent company maintains a shelf registration statement that has registered common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares and warrants and unsecured debt securities 
subject to the company s ongoing compliance with securities laws  and if warranted by market conditions  the company may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement 
the parent company also guarantees the operating partnership s secured and unsecured debt obligations which as of december   amounted to million and  million  respectively 
if the operating partnership were to fail to comply with its debt requirements  the parent company would be required to fulfill the operating partnership s commitments under such guarantees 
as of december   the operating partnership was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  the parent company is required to  among other things  pay dividends to its shareholders of at least of its reit taxable income 
the parent company has historically satisfied this requirement 
overall  the liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership s ability to make distributions to the parent company 
however  there can be no assurance that the operating partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available to meet its working capital needs including its ability to make distribution payments to the parent company 
in cases where the operating partnership is faced with working capital problems or would need to raise capital to fund acquisitions and developments  the parent company will have to consider alternative sources to increase liquidity  including  among other things  equity issuances through its existing offering program  use of its available line of credit and potential sale of properties 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership general the operating partnership s principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund repayment of certain debt instruments when they mature  fund current development and redevelopment costs  and fund distributions to the parent company 
the operating partnership believes that with the uncertain economic conditions  it is likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may continue to increase in most or all of its markets in and possibly beyond 
as a result  the operating partnership s revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  and its cash flow could be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the operating partnership expects that it would finance cash deficits through borrowings under our credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the operating partnership believes that its liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations  financing activities and selective property sales 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are its principal sources of cash used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain its reit qualification 
the operating partnership seeks to increase cash flows from its properties by maintaining quality standards for its properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
the operating partnership s revenue also includes third party fees generated by its property management  leasing  development  and construction businesses 
the operating partnership believes that its revenue  together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings  will continue to provide funds for its short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in its operating or financing activities may adversely affect its net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect its ability to fund distributions to the parent company  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in its cash provided by operations would affect the financial performance covenants under its credit facility  unsecured term loan and unsecured notes 
financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty 
the operating partnership s ability to fund development projects  as well as its ability to repay or refinance debt maturities could be adversely affected by its inability to secure financing at reasonable terms beyond those already completed 
it is possible  in these unusual and uncertain times that one or more lenders in its credit facility could fail to fund a borrowing request 
such an event could adversely affect its ability to access funds from its credit facility when needed 
the operating partnership s liquidity management remains a priority 
the operating partnership is proactively pursuing new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position 
as a result of these dedicated efforts  the operating partnership is comfortable with its ability to meet future debt maturities and development or property acquisition funding needs 
the operating partnership believes that its current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing  despite the volatility in the credit markets 
the following are the operating partnership s significant activities during affecting its liquidity management from the inception of the parent company s continuous equity offering program in march through december   the parent company had contributed million in net proceeds from the sale of  common shares to the operating partnership in exchange for the issuance of  common partnership units to the parent company 
the operating partnership used the net proceeds contributed by the parent company to reduce borrowings under the credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in june  the operating partnership through one of its wholly owned trs entities  received a million contribution under the historic tax credit transaction entered into in with us bancorp 

table of contents on august   the operating partnership issued  units of its newly established class f units in connection with the acquisition of three logan square 
the class f units do not accrue a dividend and are not entitled to income or loss allocations prior to the first anniversary of the closing 
they are also not convertible into the parent company s common shares for that period 
for purposes of computing the total purchase price of three logan square  the class f units were valued based on the closing market price of the parent company s common shares on the acquisition date of less the annual dividend rate per share of to reflect that these units do not begin to accrue a dividend prior to the first anniversary of their issuance

as of december   the operating partnership has received million of the total amount held back 
the loans are non recourse and are secured by the irs philadelphia campus and the cira south garage  respectively 
the loans bear interest at per annum with interest only through september  and thereafter require principal and interest monthly payments through its maturity in september the operating partnership used the loan proceeds to reduce borrowings under its credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
the operating partnership uses multiple financing sources to fund its long term capital needs 
it uses its credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
it will also consider other properties within its portfolio as necessary  where it may be in its best interest to obtain a secured mortgage 
the operating partnership s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including its credit ratings  the value of its unencumbered assets  its degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by its current lenders 
if more than one rating agency were to downgrade its credit rating  its access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under its existing credit facility and the term loan would increase 
the operating partnership s ability to sell its limited partnership and preferred units is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and the current trading price of the parent company s shares 
the parent company contributes the proceeds it receives from its equity issuances to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of the operating partnership in accordance with the operating partnership s partnership agreement 
the operating partnership uses the net proceeds from the sales contributed by the parent company to reduce borrowings under the credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
the operating partnership  from time to time  also issues its own partnership units as consideration for property acquisitions and developments as shown in one of the operating partnership s activities during above the operating partnership will also consider sales of selected properties as another source of managing its liquidity 
asset sales during and through have been a source of cash 
during  it sold properties containing million in net rentable square feet for net cash proceeds of million 
since mid  the operating partnership has used proceeds from asset sales to repay existing indebtedness  provide capital for its development activities and strengthen its financial condition 
there is no guarantee that it will be able to raise similar or even lesser amounts of capital from future asset sales

these circumstances have impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
as a result  the operating partnership expects debt financings will be more difficult to obtain and that borrowing costs on new and refinanced debt will be more expensive 
moreover  the volatility in the financial markets  in general  will make it more difficult or costly  for it to raise capital through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity instruments or through public issuances of debt securities from its shelf registration statement as it has been able to do in the past 
such conditions would also limit its ability to raise capital through asset dispositions at attractive prices or at all

interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the operating partnership s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
the operating partnership s financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   its consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages  million of variable rate mortgages  million in borrowings under its credit facility  million borrowings in an unsecured term loan and  million in unsecured notes before reduction of discounts of which  million are fixed rate borrowings and million are variable rate borrowings 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
as of december   based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the fair value of the operating partnership s unsecured notes was billion 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of its debt  including the notes  of approximately million at december  from time to time or as the need arises  the operating partnership uses derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative purposes 
all of the operating partnership s interest rate swap agreements matured on october  the total carrying value of the operating partnership s variable rate debt was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the total fair value of the operating partnership s debt was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of its debt of approximately million at december   and a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of its debt of approximately million at december 
table of contents if market rates of interest were to increase by  the fair value of the operating partnership s outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest were to decrease by  the fair value of its outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   the operating partnership s outstanding variable rate debt based on libor totaled approximately million 
at december   the interest rate on its variable rate debt was approximately 
if market interest rates on its variable rate debt change by basis points  total interest expense would change by approximately million for the year ended december  these amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the operating partnership s financial instruments 
due to the uncertainty of specific actions the operating partnership may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases  this analysis assumes no changes in its applicable financial instruments or structure
