item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents industry background the commercial real estate industry encompasses real estate asset types such as office  industrial  retail  multi family  hotel  storage and land for development 
according to prudential real estate investors  the aggregate value of commercial real estate in the united states was approximately trillion as of much like the residential real estate industry  the commercial real estate industry relies primarily on brokers and agents who facilitate sales and leasing transactions for a commission 
according to cb richard ellis  the commercial real estate services industry in the united states generated approximately billion in services revenue in this brokerage system is highly fragmented and  according to cb richard ellis  the top five commercial real estate brokerage firms accounted for less than of the revenue generated by the commercial real estate services industry in in most cases  commercial real estate agents associated with both small and large brokerage firms operate as independent contractors  make decisions for property marketing strategies  and seek cost effective means to market their property listings 
we believe that the majority of transactions in the industry are small and are consummated by local independent brokers 
according to the association of real estate license law officials  there are approximately million licensed real estate professionals in the united states  including commercial and residential real estate agents 
in addition to the brokerage community  industry participants include tenants  owners  property investors and business operators  all of which are actively involved in commercial real estate transactions 
commercial office  industrial  and retail properties are often occupied by operating businesses  which are generally either rent paying tenants or owners of those properties 
according to the small business administration  in there were approximately million operating businesses classified as employers and there were another million operating businesses which were classified as non employers  such as small family owned and operated businesses 
we also believe that there are a large number of private investors who actively participate in commercial real estate transactions 
the traditional processes for marketing commercial real estate are inefficient 
traditionally  agents working on behalf of commercial real estate sellers and landlords market their property listings through methods such as word of mouth in the brokerage community  signage placed directly on buildings for sale or with space for lease  availability lists that are printed and shared among brokerage firms  advertisements placed in print media including newspapers and other publications  direct mail campaigns and emails sent to private distribution lists 
similarly  the process of searching for properties available for sale or for lease has been inefficient 
unlike the residential real estate industry  which is served by local multiple listing services or other central local databases of residential real properties available for sale  there has not been an equivalent listing service in the commercial real estate or operating business for sale industries 
as a result  compiling a comprehensive and reliable collection of current for sale or for lease property listings has been a slow and expensive process for individual commercial real estate participants  requiring significant resources and often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete information 
traditional methods of gathering commercial real estate information have also been inefficient 
the industry s size  fragmentation  and structure have made the collection  sharing  and dissemination of information inconsistent and difficult 
as a result  industry participants often spend considerable amounts of time and money gathering  organizing  and analyzing data on commercial real estate transactions and properties 
in addition  many of these efforts are ultimately duplicative with those being undertaken by other industry participants 
the loopnet model we provide an online marketplace that efficiently connects commercial real estate supply and demand 
our marketplace enables agents working on behalf of commercial real estate owners and landlords to list properties for sale or for lease 
we provide tools that allow property listers to proactively contact potential buyers and tenants seeking specific types of properties 
similarly  we enable commercial real estate agents  buyers and tenants to search for available property listings that meet their criteria  such as price range  location  building size and property type 
individuals that search for and find properties that meet their requirements on our marketplace are able to 
table of contents contact and connect with the listing party and initiate a commercial real estate transaction such as a property purchase or lease 
we offer property searchers access to a large number of available property listings that would be difficult and costly to compile through traditional means 
we also enable property listers to cost effectively reach a large number of buyers and tenants 
we believe that the loopnet online marketplace enables our members to initiate and complete more commercial real estate transactions more cost effectively than through other means 
the key attributes of our business model include scale in our commercial real estate online marketplace 
we believe we have aggregated a critical mass of commercial real estate agents  property owners  landlords  buyers  tenants and for sale or for lease property listings 
as of december   the loopnet marketplace had approximately million registered members   premium members  and  was visited by approximately million unique visitors per month  on average  during  as reported by comscore media metrix 
in aggregate  our commercial real estate marketplace contained  listings of available for sale and for lease properties  as of december   and  during the year ended december   visitors to this marketplace viewed property profiles on our website approximately million times 
we believe this critical mass of commercial real estate industry participants and properties listed for sale or for lease creates a cycle that helps us to continue to grow our member base and expand our online marketplace 
commercial real estate agents  property owners and landlords are attracted to loopnet as a result of the large number of potential buyers and tenants  who in turn are attracted to our marketplace by the broad selection of properties listed on our marketplaces 
expansive member generated content offering 
the majority of our for sale and for lease property listings are submitted by our members through our website  using our online tools 
we enable members to provide detailed content on a property listing including description  financial and tenant information  photographs and key property characteristics 
we automatically compile this content into an interactive property profile that is available to our members when they search for properties on our website 
we believe that the content provided in our property profiles is more comprehensive  up to date and useful than the information provided in traditional commercial real estate property listings  such as newspaper and magazine ads or property signs 
in addition  we believe that using member generated property listings has allowed us to grow our online marketplace more efficiently and cost effectively than if we had compiled the listings on our own 
compelling member experience 
our marketplace is accessible at any time and we believe it is an intuitive  easy to use online service 
upon registering as a member  an owner or agent working for the owner can list properties on the service  and buyers and tenants can search for property listings quickly and easily 
properties are searchable immediately upon listing by our members 
basic members can list and search the properties for free 
our members can sign up to receive an email with updated listings that meet their criteria on a daily or weekly basis 
we also offer several online tools that facilitate the communication between parties who are seeking to make a commercial real estate transaction 
for example  a premium member that has listed a property can use our prospectlist feature to email other members who have searched for similar properties on our website 
members searching for properties are able to use our myloopnet feature to store multiple property profiles online to better organize their search process and find the property that is right for them 
to assist members further  we offer member support via email and phone 
we also provide our customers with single source access to business critical information  through our recentsales and property research database offerings 
recentsales provides our customers with access to historical sale transaction information on more than one million commercial properties nationwide  while our recently launched property research database  delivers valuable data on more than million properties in the united states  including such things as owner and tenant details  mortgage and lender histories  tax records and assessed values  historical listing information  and  property details and photos 
we also provide asking price and asking rent trends by region and property type 
we believe these information services complement the commercial real estate marketplace that we operate  by helping our customers make better informed  more rapid decisions about specific commercial real estate properties  transactions  and business strategies 
in addition to our loopnet marketplace  we also operate bizbuysell and bizquest  online marketplaces that enable business owners  sellers and brokers to list and search for operating businesses for sale 
we believe that the 
table of contents operating business market is complementary in several ways to the commercial real estate market 
in many cases  owners or brokers who are seeking to sell a business are also selling the commercial real estate associated with the business  and business owners are active participants in the commercial real estate market as both buyers and tenants 
in addition  many commercial real estate agents also function as business brokers 
we believe that bizbuysell and bizquest benefit operating business owners  sellers and brokers by providing efficient online marketplaces to connect and initiate transactions 
the loopnet advantage we developed our marketplace to address the needs of commercial real estate agents and the property owners  landlords  buyers and tenants they represent 
benefits to property listers broad marketing exposure 
our online marketplace offers commercial real estate agents and the owners and landlords they represent an efficient way to market properties available for sale or for lease 
properties listed on our website gain exposure to our large audience of members who are interested in commercial real estate opportunities 
the size and geographic breadth of our marketplace and member base enables property listers to realize marketing benefits for listings on both a local and national level 
we believe that the marketing exposure provided by a property listing on our marketplace is superior to traditional commercial real estate marketing methods  such as newspapers ads and newsletters  and enables our members to complete more sale and lease transactions in a more efficient manner 
cost effective and measurable marketing method 
we believe that the loopnet online marketplace is more cost effective and accountable than traditional methods for marketing commercial real estate properties 
premium members are able to use our reporting tools to track and monitor the marketing exposure of their property listings and receive a marketing statistics email that indicates the number of times a property profile has been viewed 
we believe that the low cost of a monthly premium membership and the features and measurability of our product offering is superior to commercial real estate marketing alternatives 
detailed and up to date property listing information 
our marketplace allows our members to provide significantly more information on a real time basis than they typically can provide using traditional commercial real estate marketing methods 
for example  when submitting a property listing  a member may choose to include files containing detailed financial spreadsheets  descriptive brochures or hyperlinks to other information 
we offer a set of online tools and services that facilitate the submission and verification of commercial real estate property listing information  and we provide additional information relating to the property such as detailed location and demographic data and aerial and satellite imagery 
in addition  our online marketplace enables members to update their property listings 
these updates are immediately available on our marketplace  ensuring that the property listings provide the most comprehensive and timely information 
benefits to property searchers access to a large number of detailed and up to date property listings 
our online commercial real estate marketplace contained  property listings as of december   primarily from the united states 
the listings in our marketplaces include all major asset types  such as office  industrial  retail  land and multi family properties of all sizes 
moreover  our marketplaces allow our members to update their listings and provide significantly more information on a real time basis 
we believe that commercial real estate agents  brokers  buyers  and tenants benefit from the easy  anytime access we provide to an expansive  detailed selection of up to date property listings 
single source access to business critical information 
our online commercial real estate marketplace and information services offer our customers easy  anytime access to substantial volumes of content on commercial real estate properties throughout the united states 
through our marketplace  our customers gain access to a large selection of properties currently available for sale and for lease 
through our information services  our customers may gain access to historical sale transaction information  owner and tenant details  mortgage and lender histories  tax records and assessed values  historical listing information  property details and photos  and  asking price and 
table of contents asking rent trends by region and property type 
we believe our data sets are more comprehensive  up to date  and useful than independently collected commercial property and transaction data  facilitating better informed  more rapid decisions 
customized search engine 
we have designed our online marketplace to be easy to use and navigate 
commercial real estate agents  buyers and tenants use our proprietary commercial real estate search engine to quickly find properties in our marketplace that meet their criteria 
members can search based on a number of commercial real estate industry specific variables including property type and sub type  location  size  price range and key word 
we believe that offering a customized search engine makes our website easier to use for our members and allows them to derive more value from our online marketplace 
our strategy our objective is to enhance our position as the leading online marketplace for commercial real estate  operating businesses for sale  and related markets 
to achieve this objective  we are pursuing the following strategy increasing the number of marketplace users 
we believe that growing our base of registered members and premium members increases the value of our online marketplace to the sources of both supply and demand for the commercial real estate market 
more property listings attract more individuals searching for properties  which in turn attracts more individuals seeking to list properties  making loopnet s marketplace more valuable for all of our members 
we intend to continue growing our user base through focused marketing efforts  word of mouth referrals  and  online and traditional marketing and direct marketing campaigns 
in addition  we plan to promote increased usage of our online marketplace by facilitating more property listings and searches by existing members 
as part of our efforts to increase our base of registered members  we offer free basic membership with limited functionality 
increasing revenue from premium members 
we derive revenues primarily from premium memberships  so it is critical to our future growth that we convert basic members into premium members and grow our revenue per premium member 
we intend to grow our premium member base by increasing the number of basic members and then highlighting to them the value and benefits of premium membership 
we also intend to grow our revenue per premium member by continuing to increase the value of the services we provide to our premium members  and to increase the number of services we deliver to each customer and through offering complementary products and services as described below 
we promote the premium offering to our basic members throughout our website  including at initial registration and when they list and search for properties 
we also plan on continuing to engage in targeted direct marketing to convert basic members into premium members 
offering complementary products and services 
we intend to expand our solution set  and increase the number of products and services used by existing customers through the introduction of complementary products and services that target participants in the commercial real estate industry 
as was the case when we brought to market recentsales in and property research database in  among other services  these new offerings could help commercial real estate transaction participants improve their analysis  decision and marketing processes 
we believe new products and services may help loopnet meet an increasing number of business needs for an increasing number of commercial real estate industry participants 
enhancing the functionality of our current offerings 
we intend to continue investing in the marketplace and information services offerings we currently provide to our customers 
for example  in  we launched applications that extend our marketplace and information services offerings to multiple mobile platforms  including iphone  ipod touch  ipad  android  and blackberry  among others 
we also made numerous enhancements to recentsales  including faster and easier to use search infrastructure  as well as expanded and enhanced information content 
and in december  we announced the beta release of enterprise deal tools  a suite of deal management products  and in february  we released version of our property research database with enhanced features such as advanced parametric search  robust reporting capabilities and additional depth and breadth to our data set 
we intend to continue to enhance our product offerings to grow our base of premium members  to offer additional complimentary products and services to those 
table of contents members  to increase the value of our online marketplaces to our members  to increase our base of information service subscribers  and  to increase the value of the information services that we deliver 
expanding into new markets 
we also believe that there are opportunities to expand into new markets 
we expanded into the operating business for sale market through our acquisition of bizbuysell  an online marketplace for operating businesses for sale  in october and completed the acquisition of bizquest in january to further our growth and consolidation of the business for sale industry 
during  we also extended our reach into the land for sale category through the acquisition of landsofamerica 
com  after having acquired landandfarm 
com in we intend to identify and pursue appropriate opportunities in other markets that are related to the commercial real estate industry  where we can apply our expertise in developing online marketplaces 
we may also pursue similar opportunities outside the united states 
we intend to continue to increase our rate of internal and external investments  including through acquisition opportunities  to extend our leadership position and capitalize on the commercial real estate industry s shifting dynamics 
products and services our products and services facilitate the sale and lease of commercial real estate by enabling industry participants to list and find properties on our online marketplace and to contact and transact with one another 
through our online marketplace  commercial real estate agents working on behalf of sellers and landlords can list their properties for sale or for lease along with detailed qualitative descriptions  quantitative specifications  photographs and diagrams 
buyers and tenants of commercial real estate and their agents can perform highly targeted searches and review the property listings on our online marketplace 
by addressing the needs of commercial real estate industry participants  we believe that we have built the leading online commercial real estate marketplace 
our customers access the loopnet  landsofamerica  landandfarm  bizbuysell and bizquest online marketplaces through the following product and service offerings basic and premium membership

our primary source of new registered members is word of mouth referrals 
we use direct marketing and online and traditional advertising to market to potential members 
our direct marketing program includes direct mail  email and outbound telesales campaigns that are designed to deliver targeted messages to prospective members about our products and services

competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and fragmented  with limited barriers to entry in certain segments 
we face competition from a variety of sources with respect to our different product offerings 
because there is no comprehensive national commercial real estate multiple listing service  customers use all of the traditional practices used by the commercial real estate industry 
these include print brochures created by listing agents that are mailed and distributed by hand  current availabilities lists printed and shared among brokerage firms  signage on properties  email brochures distributed to private distribution lists  word of mouth in the brokerage community  and newspaper advertisements 
we believe that these practices do not create an efficient mechanism to market  search or compare property listings locally or nationally 
the national association of realtors or nar  its local boards of realtors  its various affiliates  and third party technology services providers such as epropertydata  xceligent  inc and catylist  inc  have created local  regional or national commercial real estate information and listing services 
these services provide commercial real estate for sale and for lease property listings  and transaction comparables  which compete directly with our online commercial real estate marketplace services 
several companies  such as property line  inc  buildingsearch 
com  realup  costar group  and rofo 
com  have created online property listing services that compete with us 
these companies aggregate property listings obtained through various sources  including from commercial real estate agents 
in addition  newspapers generally include on their websites classified listings of commercial real estate for sale and for lease 
companies such as ebay  craigslist  oodle  move 
com  trulia and vast provide commercial real estate listing or advertising services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services 
ebay  oodle and craigslist operate 
table of contents real estate listing services which include commercial real estate and operating businesses 
other large internet companies  such as google  yahoo and microsoft  have classified listing services which could be used to market and search for commercial real estate property listings 
there are several providers of commercial real estate information services and analytical products that compete with various loopnet products and services 
these include costar group  real capital analytics  reis  inc  axiometrics  ipd and torto wheaton research 
providers of public records data offer products and services which also compete directly or indirectly with various loopnet information services products 
in addition  many brokerage and appraisal firms maintain their own proprietary research operations which they may utilize instead of the information services provided by loopnet or other third party providers 
there are several large  nationally known providers of information services to multiple industry verticals  including thomson reuters  reed elsevier  bloomberg and mcgraw hill  which provide information services to various segments of the commercial real estate sector today 
while these firms are not directly competitive with loopnet today  they have either expressed interest in  or have the resources to develop and bring to market  products which compete more directly with our products 
in the market for technology enabled marketing and transaction services  we compete with a variety of providers  including real capital markets  peracon  quickspace  property line  mindmatrix  informetrics and catylist 
in the land for sale sector  we compete with a broad array of online marketplaces  including landwatch  land 
net  landflip and homes land  as well as local and regional multiple listing services which provide land listings

item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
although the risk factors below are the ones management deems significant  additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presumably deem less significant also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the ongoing uncertainty in the commercial real estate market and overall economy could negatively affect our revenues  expenses and operating results 
our business is sensitive to trends in the general economy and trends in commercial real estate markets  which are unpredictable and continue to be volatile and subject to uncertainty 
although we are currently seeing signs of stabilization after a prolonged downturn  the depressed debt markets continue to affect the investment sales market and have been contributing to a slow down in our industry  which we anticipate will continue through these negative general economic conditions could further reduce the overall amount of sale and leasing activity in the commercial real estate industry  and hence the demand for our services 
conditions such as continued tightening in credit markets  reduced industry wide transaction volumes and negative trends in consumer confidence in global and domestic markets could also further dampen the general economy  and our business 
while we believe the increase in the number of distressed sales and resulting decrease in asset prices will eventually translate to greater market activity  the current overall reduction in sales transaction volume continues to negatively impact our business 
therefore  our operating results  to the extent they reflect changes in the broader commercial real estate industry  may be subject to significant fluctuations 
factors that are affecting and could further affect the commercial real estate industry include periods of economic slowdown or recession globally  in the united states or locally  inflation  flows of capital into or out of real estate investment in the united states or various regions of the united states  rates of unemployment  interest rates  the availability and cost of capital  wage and salary levels  or concerns about any of the foregoing 
we believe that the commercial real estate industry is composed of many submarkets  each of which is influenced differently  and often in opposite ways  by various economic factors 
we believe that commercial real estate submarkets can be differentiated based on factors such as geographic location  value of properties  whether 
table of contents properties are sold or leased  and other factors 
each such submarket may be affected differently by  among other things economic slowdown or recession  changes in levels of rent or appreciation of asset values  changing interest rates  tax and accounting policies  the availability and cost of capital  costs of construction  increased unemployment  lower consumer confidence  lower wage and salary levels  war  terrorist attacks or natural disasters  or the public perception that any of these conditions may occur 
for example  as of december   approximately of our premium members were based in california and approximately were based in florida 
negative conditions in these or other significant commercial real estate submarkets could disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations of their customers 
events such as a war or a significant terrorist attack are also likely to affect the general economy  and could cause a slowdown in the commercial real estate industry and therefore reduce utilization of our marketplace  which could reduce our revenue from premium members 
the occurrence of any of the events listed above could increase our need to make significant expenditures to continue to attract customers to our marketplace 
our business is largely based on a subscription model  and accordingly  any failure to increase the number of our customers or retain existing customers could cause our revenues to decline 
our customers include premium members of our loopnet marketplace  looplink users  users of our bizbuysell  bizquest  cityfeet  landsofamerica and landandfarm marketplaces  recentsales subscribers  reapplications users and advertising and lead generation customers 
most of our current revenues are generated by subscription fees paid by our premium members 
our growth depends in large part on increasing the number of our free basic members and then converting them into paying premium members  as well as retaining existing premium members 
either category of members may decide not to continue to use our services in favor of alternate services or because of budgetary constraints or other reasons 
since the fourth quarter of  our average monthly cancellation rate for premium members has exceeded our historical rate of three to five percent  although the cancellation in the fourth quarter of was the lowest it has been in three years  falling within our expected range of to 
we believe the higher cancellation rate is primarily the result of a significant slow down in transaction activity in the commercial real estate industry that began in the fourth quarter of  due to deteriorating economic conditions and due to the credit crunch impacting the availability and cost of debt capital for real estate transactions 
if our existing members choose not to use our services  decrease their use of our services  or change from being premium members to basic members  or we are unable to attract new members  listings on our site could be reduced  search activity on our website could decline  the usefulness of our services could be diminished  and we could incur significant expenses and or experience declining revenues 
the value of our marketplaces to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of property listings provided by and searches conducted by our members 
to grow our marketplaces  we must convince prospective members to use our services 
prospective members may not be familiar with our services and may be accustomed to using traditional methods of listing  searching  marketing and advertising commercial real estate 
we cannot assure 
table of contents you that we will be successful in continuing to acquire more members  in continuing to convert free basic members into paying premium members or that our future sales efforts in general will be effective 
further  it is difficult to estimate the total number of active commercial real estate agents  property owners  landlords  buyers and tenants in the united states during any given period 
as a result  we do not know the extent to which we have penetrated this market 
if we reach the point at which we have attempted to sell our services to a significant majority of commercial real estate transaction participants in the united states  we will need to seek additional products and markets in order to maintain our rate of growth of revenues and profitability 
we rely on our marketing efforts to generate new registered members 
if our marketing efforts are ineffective  we could fail to attract new registered members  which could reduce the attractiveness of our marketplace to current and potential customers and lead to a reduction in our revenues 
we believe that the attractiveness of our services and products to our current and potential customers increases as we attract additional members who provide additional property listings or conduct searches on our marketplace 
this is because an increase in the number of our members and the number of listings on our website increases the utility of our website and of its associated search  listing and marketing services 
in order to attract new registered members  we rely on our marketing efforts  such as word of mouth referrals  direct marketing  online and traditional advertising  sponsoring and attending local industry association events  and attending and exhibiting at industry trade shows and conferences 
there is no guarantee that our marketing efforts will be effective 
furthermore  our ability to develop and successfully market our new information products and services may also be important in attracting new registered members 
if we are unable to effectively market our existing and new products and services to new customers  or convert existing basic members into premium members  and we are not able to offset any decline in our rate of conversion of basic members to premium members with higher average subscription prices  our revenues and operating results could decline as a result of current premium members failing to renew their premium memberships and potential premium members failing to become premium members 
if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers  agents  and property owners  our marketplace could be less attractive to current or potential customers  which could result in a reduction in our revenues 
our success depends substantially on the number of commercial real estate property listings submitted by brokers  agents and property owners to our online marketplace 
the number of listings on our marketplace has increased to  as of december   from  as of december   and  as of december  if agents marketing large numbers of property listings  such as large brokers in key real estate markets  choose not to continue their listings with us  or choose to list them with a competitor  our website would be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants  thus resulting in cancelled premium memberships  failure to attract and retain new members  or failure to attract advertising and lead generation revenues 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors 
the market to provide property listing  searching  information services and analytical products  and marketing and transaction services to the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented  with limited barriers to entry in certain segments 
in the land for sale and businesses for sale sectors  we similarly compete with a broad array of online marketplaces  as well as local and regional multiple listing services 
we face competition from a variety of sources with respect to our different product offerings 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors that focus on one type of product or service area with respect to that particular product or service 
additionally  our current or new competitors may adopt aspects of our business model  which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services 
furthermore  listings in the commercial real estate industry are not marketed exclusively through any single channel  and accordingly our competition could aggregate a set of listings similar to ours 
if our current or potential customers choose to use these services rather than ours  demand for our services could decline 
increased competition could result in a reduction in our revenues or our rate of acquisition of new customers  or loss of existing customers or market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our current focus on internal and external investments for long term growth may result in flat revenue growth rates and place downward pressure on our operating margin in the near future 
as part of our initiative to increase our long term value and expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers  we have increased the rate of investments in our business  including internal investments in product development  data aggregation and information services  sales and marketing  and external investments such as acquisitions and investments in other companies  and expect to continue to do so 
for example  as part of our investment in information services  we recently launched the property research database product 
we also recently acquired landsofamerica 
this investment strategy is intended to accelerate our revenue growth and market share gains in the future as activity in the commercial real estate industry shows signs of stabilizing and begins to recover 
while we believe this strategy will enable us to capitalize on opportunities we see in our industry and extend our leadership position  we expect our operating margins to experience a downward pressure and our revenue growth rate to be flat in the short term as a result of our planned investments and economic environment 
furthermore  if the industry fails to stabilize or deteriorates further in and beyond  such investments may not have their intended effect 
for instance  our external investments may lose value and as a result  we may incur an impairment charge with respect to such investment 
if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or fail to adequately anticipate potential problems  we may experience further decreases in our revenues and operating margins 
if we are unable to introduce new or upgraded services  products or enabling technologies that our customers recognize as valuable  we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing customers 
our efforts to develop new and upgraded products and services could require us to incur significant costs 
to continue to attract new members to our online marketplace  we may need to continue to introduce new products or services or develop additional enabling technologies 
we may choose to develop new products and services independently or choose to license or otherwise integrate content and data from third parties 
developing and delivering these new or upgraded services or products may impose costs and require the attention of our product and technology department and management 
this process is costly  and we may experience difficulties in developing and delivering these new or upgraded services or products 
in addition  successfully launching and selling a new service or product will require the use of our sales and marketing resources 
efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use  responsiveness  functionality and features of our existing products and services have inherent risks  and we may not be able to manage these product developments and enhancements successfully 
if we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded services or products or develop additional enabling technologies  then our customers may choose not to use our products or services 
if we are not able to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions  our management s attention could be diverted  and efforts to integrate acquisitions could consume significant resources 
we have made acquisitions of  and investments in  other companies  and we may in the future further expand our markets and services in part through additional acquisitions of  or investments in  other complementary businesses  services  databases and technologies 
for example  since october  we made several acquisitions  including bizbuysell  cityfeet 
com inc  reapplications  inc  landandfarm 
com  bizquest  reactionweb and most recently  landsofamerica 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful 
the successful execution of any acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate such acquisitions and  if necessary  obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could harm our business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from the normal daily operations of our business  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions  
table of contents dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  reduction or replacement of the sales of existing services by sales of products or services from acquired lines of business  responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses  inability to maintain our internal standards  controls  procedures and policies  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
we may also incur costs  and divert our management s attention from our business  by pursuing potential acquisitions or other investments which are never consummated 
although we undertake a due diligence investigation of each business that we acquire  there may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to or are unable to discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we  as a successor owner  may be responsible 
in connection with acquisitions  we generally seek to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through indemnities and warranties from the seller  which may in some instances be supported by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price 
however  these indemnities and warranties  if obtained  may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope  amount or duration  financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor or other reasons 
in addition  if we finance or otherwise complete acquisitions or other investments by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted 
the number of our registered members is higher than the number of actual members 
the number of registered members in our network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations or others may have registered under fictitious names 
given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts  we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members  and thus we rely on the number of registered members as one of our key operating metrics and our measure of the size of our marketplace 
furthermore  although the number of our registered members  which includes both basic and premium members  has increased over the last several years  the number of premium members has decreased over the same period 
if the number of our actual members does not continue to grow and those members do not convert to premium members  then our business may not grow as fast as we expect  which will harm our operating and financial results 
our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline  and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality  each of which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues  expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenues  expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k rates of member adoption and retention  changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes  changes in our marketing or other corporate strategies  our introduction of and investments in new products and services or changes to existing products and services  the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures  the amount and timing of non cash stock based charges  costs related to acquisitions of businesses or technologies  and 
table of contents other factors outside of our control 
our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the commercial real estate industry 
the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods  particularly slow downs during the end of year holiday period  and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods  could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period 
for example  we have historically experienced a significant decline in the rate of growth of both new memberships and revenues during the fourth quarter 
these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question and or future periods or cause our stock price to decline 
if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property  our business  competitive position and operating results could be harmed 
the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property  and our intellectual property rights  including existing and future trademarks  trade secrets  and copyrights  are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of our business 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect the content of our databases and our other intellectual property 
we have taken measures to protect our intellectual property  such as requiring our employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
we also have taken action  and in the future may take additional action  against competitors or other parties who we believe to be infringing our intellectual property 
for example  on november  the company filed a lawsuit against costar group  inc and costar realty information  inc in the superior court for the state of california  county of los angeles  asserting claims for breach of contract and unfair business practices arising out of costar s alleged unlawful use of data from the company s web site for competitive purposes 
all litigation with costar was settled in december  although the company incurred significant legal costs to protect its intellectual property 
we may in the future find it necessary to assert claims regarding our intellectual property 
these measures may not be sufficient or effective to protect our intellectual property 
these measures could also be expensive and could significantly divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
we also rely on laws  including those regarding patents  copyrights  and trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property rights 
current laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property or our databases and the data contained in them 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could require us to develop alternative intellectual property  incur licensing or other expenses  or limit our product and service offerings 
we could face liability for information on our website or general litigation claims 
we provide information on our website  including commercial real estate listings and broker listings that are submitted by our customers and third parties 
we also allow third parties to advertise their products and services on our website and include links to third party websites 
we could be exposed to liability with respect to this information 
customers could assert that information concerning them on our website is misleading and contains errors or omissions 
third parties could seek damages for losses incurred if they rely upon incorrect information provided by our customers or advertisers 
we could also be subject to claims that the persons posting information on our website do not have the right to post such information or are infringing the rights of third parties or do not have the qualifications or licenses they disclose 
for example  in  costar sued us  claiming that we had directly and indirectly infringed their copyrights in photographs by permitting our members to post those photographs on our website 
although the court issued rulings that were favorable to us in that litigation  other persons might assert similar or other claims in the future 
in june  costar filed a complaint against us alleging that we have infringed their copyrights and trademarks because photographs bearing costar s logo that were posted by third 
table of contents parties allegedly appeared in our recentsales product 
all current litigation with costar was settled in december among other things  we might be subject to claims that by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties  we would be liable for wrongful actions by the third parties operating those websites 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims 
the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  allows copyright owners to obtain subpoenas compelling disclosure by an internet service provider of the names of customers of that internet service provider 
we have been served with such subpoenas in the past  and may in the future be served with additional such subpoenas 
compliance with subpoenas under the dmca may divert our resources  including the attention of our management  which could impede our ability to operate our business 
our potential liability for information on our websites or distributed by us to others could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our online marketplace to users 
our general liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
if we are unable to convince commercial real estate brokers and other commercial real estate professionals that our services and products are superior to traditional methods of listing  searching  and marketing commercial real estate  they could choose not to use our marketplace  which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses 
our primary source of new customers is participants in the commercial real estate community 
many commercial real estate professionals are use to listing  searching and marketing real estate in traditional and off line ways  such as through the distribution of print brochures  sharing of written lists  placing signs on properties  word of mouth  and newspaper advertisements 
commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services 
if we are not able to continue to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services  they may choose not to use our online marketplace  which could negatively impact our business 
our business depends on retaining and attracting capable management and operating personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract high quality management and operating personnel  including our chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  richard j 
boyle  jr  our president and chief operating officer  thomas byrne  our chief financial officer and senior vice president  finance and administration  brent stumme  and our other senior vice presidents 
our current long term business strategy was developed in large part by our senior level officers that depends in part on their skills and knowledge to implement  and also includes a focus on new growth and investment initiatives that may require additional management expertise to successfully execute our strategy 
we may not be able to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr 
boyle or other key officers or employees or recruit additional talent 
we have no employment agreements that prevent any of our key personnel from terminating their employment at any time  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
furthermore  our business requires skilled technical  management  product and technology  and sales and marketing personnel  who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry  and the loss of a substantial number of qualified employees  or an inability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities  could harm our business 
to retain and attract key personnel  we use various measures  including an equity incentive program and incentive bonuses for key executive officers and other employees 
we have also entered into change of control severance agreements with our key executive officers  which provide  in part  certain severance benefits and acceleration of unvested equity awards if their employment is terminated in connection with a change of control of the company 
these measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to execute our business plan 

table of contents certain us and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that may subject us to claims or other remedies 
our failure to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
laws and regulations which are particularly relevant to our business address information security  content and the distribution of content  taxation  intellectual property rights  characteristics and quality of products and services  and online advertising and marketing  including email marketing and unsolicited commercial email 
many applicable laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet 
the laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts  but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 
for example  the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are evolving 
claims have been either threatened or filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation  libel  slander  invasion of privacy and other tort claims  unlawful activity  copyright and trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the advertisements posted by our websites users  our products and services  or content generated by our users 
federal and state legislation regulating email communications and internet advertising  such as privacy related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email commonly known as spam may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost effective manner 
violation of such laws may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation 
the can spam act of  or can spam  imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial email 
depending on how the law is interpreted and applied  can spam may impose significant costs and burdens on our email marketing practices 
federal  state and local tax authorities may alter tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce 
new  revised or existing tax regulations  whether domestic or internationally  may subject us or our affiliates to additional state sales  income and other taxes 
we cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales  income or other taxes on commerce over the internet 
new or revised taxes  particularly sales taxes  could negatively affect the attractiveness of advertising and selling products and services over the internet and increase our costs 
these events  if they occur  could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches  or if our members or potential members are reluctant to use our marketplace because of privacy concerns  we might face additional costs  and activity in our marketplace could decline 
as part of our membership registration process  we collect  use and disclose personally identifiable information  including names  addresses  phone numbers  credit card numbers and email addresses 
our policies concerning the collection  use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites 
while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies  we could be subject to legal claims  government action or harm to our reputation if actual practices fail to comply or are seen as failing to comply with our policies or with local  state or federal laws concerning personally identifiable information or if our policies are inadequate to protect the personally identifiable information that we collect 
concern among prospective customers regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites could keep prospective customers from using our marketplace 
industry wide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites  including misappropriation of third party information  security breaches  or changes in industry standards  regulations or laws could deter people from using the internet or our website to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  which could harm our business 
under california law and the laws of a number of other states  if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal customer data has been stolen  we are required to inform any customers whose data was stolen  which could harm our reputation and business 
in addition  another california law requires businesses that maintain personal information about california residents in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure 
our practice is to encrypt all personal information  but we do not know whether our current practice will continue to be deemed sufficient under the california law 
other states have enacted different and sometimes contradictory requirements 
table of contents for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically 
compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of the different states is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours which collects personal information from customers in multiple jurisdictions 
another consequence of failure to comply is the possibility of adverse publicity and loss of consumer confidence were it known that we did not take adequate measures to assure the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that our customers had given to us 
this could result in a loss of customers and revenue that could jeopardize our success 
while we intend to comply fully with all relevant laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in avoiding all potential liability or disruption of business in the event that we do not comply in every instance or in the event that the security of the customer data that we collect is compromised  regardless of whether our practices comply or not 
if we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such laws  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  complying with the applicable notice requirements in the event of a security breach could result in significant costs 
our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of intellectual property rights infringement 
we may be subject to claims against us alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  including our competitors 
any intellectual property claims  regardless of merit  could be expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
our technologies and content may not be able to withstand third party claims of infringement 
if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims  we might have to pay damages  stop using the technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights  seek a license for the infringing technology or content  or develop alternative non infringing technology or content 
licenses for the infringing technology or content may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  developing alternative non infringing technology or content could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business  we may be forced to limit our service offerings 
any of these results could reduce our ability to compete effectively and harm our business 
our trademarks are important to our business 
other companies may own  obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent  limit or interfere with our use of trademarks 
if we were unable to use our trademarks  we would need to devote substantial resources toward developing different brand identities 
unless we develop  maintain and protect our brand identity  our business may not grow and our financial results may suffer 
in an effort to obtain additional registered members and increase use of our online marketplace by commercial real estate transaction participants  we intend to continue to pursue a strategy of enhancing our brand both through online advertising and through traditional print media 
these efforts can involve significant expense and may not have a material positive impact on our brand identity 
in addition  maintaining our brand will depend on our ability to provide products and services that are perceived as being high value  which we may not be able to implement successfully 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand  our ability to attract and retain customers or successfully expand our operations will be harmed 
changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or adversely affect our reported financial results 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions contemplated before the announcement of the change 
in addition  the sec has announced a multi year plan that 
table of contents could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings 
any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or equity research analysts  our market price may decline and we may be subject to class action litigation 
it is possible that in the future our operating results will not meet the expectations of investors or equity research analysts  causing the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  companies that have experienced decreases in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
a securities class action lawsuit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
if our website or our other services experience system failures  our customers may be dissatisfied and our operations could be impaired 
our business depends upon the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our website 
problems with our website could result in reduced demand for our services 
furthermore  the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors 
despite testing  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software 
any errors could result in adverse publicity  impaired use of our services  loss of revenues  cost increases or legal claims by customers 
additionally  our services substantially depend on systems provided by third parties  over whom we have little control 
interruptions in our services could result from the failure of data providers  telecommunications providers  or other third parties 
we depend on these third party providers of internet communication services to provide continuous and uninterrupted service 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide access to our services 
any disruption in the internet access provided by third party providers or any failure of third party providers to handle higher volumes of user traffic could harm our business 
our internal network infrastructure could be disrupted or penetrated  which could materially impact our ability to provide our services and our customers confidence in our services 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  most of which are located in redundant and independent systems in los angeles  california and san francisco  california 
in addition  we utilize data centers in virginia  texas  colorado and new york for specific services 
while we believe that our systems are adequate to support our operations  our systems may be vulnerable to damage from break ins  unauthorized access  vandalism  fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  floods  and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
furthermore  any damage or disruption could materially impair or prohibit our ability to provide our services  which could significantly impact our business 
experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security from time to time 
although we maintain a firewall  and will continue to enhance and review our databases to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions  a hacker who penetrates our network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we also may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security 
in addition to purposeful security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 
any of these incidents could materially impact our ability to provide our services as well as materially impact the confidence of our customers in our services  either of which could significantly impact our business 
we may not be able to successfully halt the operations of websites that aggregate our data  as well as data from other companies  such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data 
third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping  robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies 
in addition  copycat websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website 
we may not be able to detect all 
table of contents such websites in a timely manner and  even if we could  technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations 
in some cases  particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the united states  our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against such websites 
regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against these websites  any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 
our stock price may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the purchase price 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other things  the risk factors described in this section of this annual report on form k  and other factors beyond our control  such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
our principal stockholders  executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock  and as a result  the trading price for our shares may be depressed and these stockholders can take actions that may be adverse to your interests 
our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
these stockholders  acting together  may have the ability to exert control over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these stockholders who are executive officers or directors  or who have representatives on our board of directors  could dictate the management of our business and affairs 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our other stockholders 
our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors or imposing a majority voting standard  authorizing the board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 

table of contents in addition  the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation laws govern us 
while we have waived the application of section of the delaware general corporation laws with respect to the investors who acquired shares of our series a convertible preferred stock in the april private placement  these provisions may otherwise prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

item legal proceedings 
in april  loopnet and cityfeet collectively the defendants were sued by real estate alliance  ltd 
real in the us district court for the central district of california for alleged infringement of certain patents the real v 
loopnet action 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages  attorney fees and costs 
the defendants deny the alleged infringement and have filed a counter claim for a declaratory judgment that the patents in suit are invalid and not infringed 
to date  discovery in the real v 
loopnet action has been limited and the court has not yet set a trial date 
moreover  because the patents in suit have been asserted against several other entities  in another pending lawsuit in the same court  the earlier filed action  the real v 
loopnet action was stayed in february  and administratively closed in february it is possible that real may attempt to re institute the real v 
loopnet action  depending upon the outcome of the earlier filed action  which is currently on appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
at this time  the company cannot predict the outcome of either the earlier filed action or the real v 
loopnet action  but if the real v 
loopnet action is re instituted  the company intends to vigorously defend itself 
from time to time  we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business

overview we own and operate the leading online marketplace for commercial real estate in the united states  based on the number of monthly unique visitors to our marketplace  which averaged approximately million per month during  compared with approximately  per month during  and approximately  during  as reported by comscore media metrix 
comscore media metrix defines a unique visitor as an individual who visited any content of a website  a category  a channel  or an application 
our online marketplace  available at www 
loopnet 
com  enables commercial real estate agents  working on behalf of property owners and landlords  to list properties for sale or for lease and submit detailed information on property listings including qualitative descriptions  financial and tenant information  photographs and key property characteristics  in order to find a buyer or tenant 
commercial real estate agents  buyers and tenants use the loopnet online marketplace to search for available property listings that meet their commercial real estate criteria 
we offer two types of memberships on the loopnet online marketplace 
basic membership is available free of charge  and enables members to experience some of the benefits of the loopnet offering  with limited functionality 
loopnet premium membership is available for a monthly subscription fee and provides enhanced marketing exposure for property listings and full access to loopnet property listings  as well as numerous other features 
the minimum term of a premium membership subscription is one month 
premium membership service remains the largest revenue contributor to our business and accounted for of our revenues in  compared with in and  reflecting changing market conditions  as well as our ongoing efforts to expand and develop our business beyond our core marketplace services 
key operating metrics and trends we believe that the key metrics that are material to an analysis of our business are the number of our registered members  the number of monthly unique visitors to our marketplace  the number of our premium members  the average monthly subscription price paid by our premium members  the cancellation rate of our premium members  the number of active commercial real estate listings on our marketplace  the number of property profiles viewed by visitors to loopnet  the number of unique paying subscribers to our other commercial real estate subscription products and services  and the average monthly subscription price paid by our unique subscribers to our commercial real estate subscription products and services 
our registered members have grown to approximately million as of december   from approximately million as of december   and million as of december  the number of monthly 
table of contents unique visitors to our marketplace averaged approximately million during our premium members were  as of december   compared with  as of december   and  as of december  the average monthly subscription price paid by our premium members has increased to in  from in  and in our average monthly cancellation rate in fell within the to range we began seeing in late we believe the higher cancellation rate seen in the last several years is primarily the result of a significant slow down in transaction activity in the commercial real estate industry that began in the fourth quarter of  due to deteriorating economic conditions and due to the credit crunch impacting the availability and cost of debt capital for real estate transactions 
premium membership fees have driven the majority of our growth in revenues since and were the source of approximately of our revenues in  compared with in and the number of listings on our marketplace has increased to  as of december   from  as of december   and  as of december  the number of property profiles that were viewed by visitors of loopnet grew to million in  from million in  and million in the number of unique paying subscribers to one or more of our commercial real estate related products and services ie premium membership  recentsales  professional profile  landsofamerica  landandfarm and property research database was  as of december   and the average monthly revenue per unique paying subscriber during the year ending december  was 
the commercial real estate cre industry has experienced and continues to experience challenging times  although certain segments of our industry began showing signs of increasing stabilization and modest improvement in transaction volume as progressed 
industry wide improvement  however  has been uneven  with most segments of the industry  particularly those involving smaller property transactions  remaining weak as compared to normalized historical standards 
to capitalize on the cre industry s shifting dynamics in and beyond  we are currently focused on initiatives to increase our long term value and expand the breadth and depth of the products and services we provide to our customers  which we believe will extend our leadership position and maximize our opportunities 
to this end  we have been increasing the rate of investment in our business through execution of our strategy and business plan  ongoing investments in our existing products and services  investments in new organic initiatives  consideration of further acquisition and external investment opportunities  and through capital structure changes such as stock buy backs 
while we continued investing in our business throughout and  during the worst commercial real estate cycle in decades  we did so cautiously in light of uncertainties around the magnitude of the decline  and the timing of recovery  in the cre industry 
however  as we began seeing early  albeit uneven  indications that activity levels in the industry may be stabilizing and in some segments  improving  we accelerated our investment plans to capitalize on the potential longer term opportunities 
in  we invested several million dollars and intend to continue doing so for the next few years on a range of internal and external investments that we believe will complement and extend our business and  over time  create meaningful long term shareholder value 
some of these investments are accelerations of ongoing efforts in areas that we have highlighted previously  such as our efforts to aggregate market and searching activity in our cre  business for sale and land for sale marketplaces  aggregate more on market available properties  develop organically new services aimed at increasing the scope of information we deliver to an expanded set of customers  our ongoing strategic investment in xceligent  a provider of fully researched information services to cre professionals  and various efforts to attract more demand side activity to our marketplace 
a significant area of investment for us has been  and will likely continue to be  our property research database product 
introduced in may  property research database uses a hybrid approach that combines user generated marketplace data with a variety of other information sources 
we believe there are significant opportunities in the ability to deliver easy access to timely  useful  accurate market data at prices below traditional alternatives particularly as we enter what we believe may be the early stage of a market recovery 
we have been gathering and responding to customer feedback and continue to refine the property research database product 
in february  we released version and we plan on selling access to this service independent of premium membership in addition to continuing to offer bundles of complimentary products and services to our subscribers and customers 
recentsales  which we developed and funded internally  was another area of investment in  which will continue through as transaction volumes likely accelerate over the next few years  we intend to continue to 
table of contents expand the breadth and depth of the data coverage in this service  providing more value to existing customers and introducing the service to many new subscribers 
we are also continuing to work on upgrading and integrating technology platforms from some of the acquisitions we have done in the past  including reapplications and landandfarm  and now bizquest  reaction web and landsofamerica which we acquired in for example  in december  we announced the beta release of enterprise deal tools  a suite of deal management products and tools that leverages reaction web s technology and enables our corporate customers to minimize back end work associated with property marketing campaigns and transaction management 
these planned investments  which extend throughout the organization to include product development  data aggregation and information services  sales marketing  and possible m a related efforts  among others  are being made to position our business for long term growth  and in anticipation of the gradual increase in activity that we believe could occur in this investment strategy is focused on accelerating our revenue growth and market share gains  as activity in the cre market begins to recover 
while this strategy may reduce our margins in the short term  we believe our investments will increase the likelihood that we will attain our goal of becoming a substantially larger company and extend our longer term competitive and technological advantages 
our revenues and expenses our primary sources of revenues are loopnet premium membership fees  other property advertising fees  such as cityfeet 
com  landsofamerica and landandfarm 
com  bizbuysell and bizquest membership fees and paid listings  advertising on  and lead generation from  our marketplaces  looplink product license fees  and loopnet recentsales membership fees 
we have been profitable and cash flow positive each quarter since the second quarter of the key factors that impact our revenues are the adoption of our premium membership services by the commercial real estate industry and cancellation rates  the average monthly subscription price of our premium membership product  the adoption of our recentsales and property research database services and other new products and services by the commercial real estate industry  and the adoption of our services by the operating business for sale industry 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from customers that pay monthly fees for a suite of services to market and search for commercial real estate and operating businesses 
the fee for our loopnet premium membership averaged per month during  compared with during  and during the minimum term of a premium membership subscription is one month 
we also offer quarterly and annual memberships which are priced and discounted accordingly  and paid in advance for the subscription period 
a customer choosing to cancel a discounted annual or quarterly membership will receive a refund based on the number of months the membership was used and charging the customer at the monthly rate rather than at the discounted quarterly or annual rates 
we also generate revenue from recentsales  by charging a flat monthly fee to access our database of recent commercial real estate transactions or a per transaction fee for individual transactions  looplink  which we license to commercial real estate brokerage firms who pay a monthly  quarterly or annual fee  and  bizbuysell and bizquest  for which we charge a flat monthly fee for business brokers to market their listings or a per listing fee for owners to market their own listings 
revenues from other sources include advertising and lead generation revenues 
table of contents from both our loopnet and business for sale marketplaces  which are recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
advertising rates are dependent on the services provided and the placement of the advertisements 
to date  the duration of our advertising commitments has generally averaged two to three months 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for salespeople 
these expenses are categorized in our statements of operations based on each employee s principal function 
seasonality and cyclicality the commercial real estate market is influenced by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
the market is large and fragmented  and different segments of the industry are influenced differently by various factors 
broadly speaking  the commercial real estate industry has two major components tenants leasing space from owners or landlords  and the investment market for buying and selling properties 
we have experienced seasonality in our business in the past  and expect to continue to experience it in the future 
while individual geographic markets vary  commercial real estate transaction activity is fairly consistent throughout the year  with the exception of a slow down during the end of year holiday period 
the impact that this has had on our business is that the growth rate in the fourth quarter of each year  while positive  has been slower than in the first three quarters of each year 
we expect this pattern to continue 
the commercial real estate industry has historically experienced cyclicality 
the different segments of the industry  such as office  industrial  retail  multi family  and others  are influenced differently by different factors  and have historically moved through cycles with different timing 
the for lease and for sale components of the market also do not necessarily move on the same timing cycle 
during the second half of and the full years of  and  the commercial real estate industry has slowed significantly  due to deteriorating economic conditions and due to the credit crunch impacting the availability and cost of debt capital for real estate transactions compared to historical norms  although we believe that modest growth in activity levels are returning but at a fairly gradual pace

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities  and other than operating leases for office space  described below  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations and known future cash requirements as of december   our principal commitments consist of obligations under certain leases for office space in california 
the offices are currently leased under operating lease agreements which expire between and 
table of contents future minimum payments under these operating leases as of december  are as follows payments due by period and thereafter total dollars in thousands operating lease obligations advertising and media contracts we purchase advertising from online vendors such as google and yahoo and pay for the services on a monthly basis 
we have no ongoing obligations to purchase a fixed or minimum amount with these vendors 
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including cash generated from operations  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services  and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
we from time to time make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
these investments and acquisitions could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  and of those policies  we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management 
accordingly  we believe the following policies are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from premium membership fees for our online marketplaces 
we recognize revenues under the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab guidance related to revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the majority of our revenues  payments for loopnet premium memberships  revenues are recognized immediately on a monthly basis as such accounts are charged on credit cards 
payments that we receive in advance of services being rendered  such as advance payments on annual and quarterly subscriptions by our premium members  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period  plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it is more likely than not that the company would generate sufficient taxable income from operations in future years to realize tax benefits arising from the use of our net operating loss carryforwards and therefore in  we reversed million of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of resulted in a tax benefit of million that was recognized in our results from operations 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realization 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in for federal and for state purposes  respectively 
under section of the internal revenue code  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited based upon changes in the percentage of our ownership 
as a result of prior ownership changes  we were limited to using million of net operating losses to offset taxable income in and estimate that we will be able to utilize approximately million in  million in and million each year thereafter until the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the permanent differences 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  such as pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from research and development credits  potential limitations on the use of federal and state net operating losses  and state taxes 
we evaluate our tax positions for all income tax items based on their technical merits to determine whether each position satisfies the more likely than not to be sustained upon examination test 
the tax benefits are then measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative basis  that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs 
as of december   we recorded a  liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets we have applied the fasb authoritative guidance regarding the principles and requirements for how to account for business combinations 
the company recognizes the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the acquired entity at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recorded in goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we compare the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity with book value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the fair value of the consolidated entity is less than the book value  then we are required to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
we performed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and concluded that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were not impaired 
intangible assets with definite lives are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the authoritative guidance on property  plant  and equipment 
the intangible assets are amortized using a straight line method and we believe no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would require an impairment test for these assets other than the required annual test 
the recognition of an asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration is to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date 
these contingent considerations may or may not be paid depending on the resolution of certain future events 
any gain or loss due to remeasurement to the fair value on the acquisition date will be recognized through the income statement 

table of contents stock based compensation since  we have applied the fasb authoritative guidance surrounding share based payments 
the guidance requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
under the new guidance we calculated the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes model were years for the expected life  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield for the year ended december  future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
in connection with the authoritative guidance  the weighted average expected option term reflects the application of the simplified method 
the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
estimated volatility also reflects the application of the authoritative guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance which amends the evaluation criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  or vie 
this new guidance requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the effective date for this amendment is reporting periods beginning after november  the company adopted this guidance effective january   and there has been no material impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in short term  high quality  interest bearing securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points  the change in the fair market value of our short term investments would not be a material amount to our financial statements
