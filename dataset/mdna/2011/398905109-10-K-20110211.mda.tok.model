item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents overview we are a leading operator in the automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises at dealership locations and collision service centers in the us and franchises at five dealerships and three collision centers in the uk we market and sell an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  south carolina and texas in the us and in the towns of brighton  farnborough  hailsham  hindhead and worthing in the uk as of december   our us retail network consisted of the following three regions with the number of dealerships they comprised i the eastern dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new york and south carolina  ii the central dealerships in kansas  oklahoma and texas  and iii the western dealerships in california 
each region is managed by a regional vice president who reports directly to our chief executive officer and is responsible for the overall performance of their regions  as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers that report to them 
each region is also managed by a regional chief financial officer who reports directly to our chief financial officer 
our dealerships in the uk are also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
from january   through december   we have purchased franchises with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of billion and been granted eight new franchises by our manufacturers  with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of million 
in alone  we acquired one import and nine luxury franchises with expected annual revenues at the time of acquisition of million 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
we make disposition decisions based principally on the rate of return on our capital investment  the location of the dealership  our ability to leverage our cost structure  the brand and existing real estate obligations 
from january   through december   we have disposed of or terminated franchises with annual revenues of approximately billion 
specifically  during  we disposed of one luxury and ten domestic franchises with annual revenues of approximately million 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the new vehicle sales impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services  as well as our ability to reduce our costs in response to lower sales 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the us  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather 
as a result  our revenues and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
since september  the us and global economies have suffered from  among other things  a substantial decline in consumer confidence  a rise in unemployment and a tightening of credit availability 
as a result  the retail 
table of contents automotive industry was negatively impacted by decreasing customer demand for new and used vehicles  vehicle margin pressures and higher inventory levels 
in response to this challenging economic environment  we took a number of steps to adjust our cost structure  strengthen our balance sheet and improve liquidity 
we implemented significant cost cuts in our ongoing operating structure  to appropriately size our business and allow us to manage through this industry downturn 
as it relates to variable expenses  our cost reductions were primarily related to personnel and advertising 
from a personnel standpoint  we made the difficult  but necessary decisions to adjust headcount and compensation  as well as temporarily suspend certain employee benefits 
we decreased overall advertising levels and shifted to utilization of various in house and email marketing tools  as well as capitalized on declining media rates 
other variable expense reductions also reflect initiatives designed to reduce software costs  contract labor  travel and entertainment  delivery and loaner car expenses 
in the latter half of  economic trends stabilized and consumer demand for new and used vehicles showed improvement 
according to industry experts  the annual unit sales for were million units  compared to million units a year ago 
though the retail and economic environment continues to be challenging  we believe that the stabilizing economic trends provide opportunities for us in the marketplace to maintain or improve profitability  including i aggressively pursuing new and used retail vehicle market share  ii continuing to focus on our higher margin parts and service business by enhancing the cost effectiveness of our marketing efforts  implementing strategic selling methods and improving operational efficiencies  and iii investing capital where necessary to support the anticipated growth in our parts and service business 
for the year ended december   we realized a net income of million  or per diluted share  and for the years ended december  and  we realized net income of million  or per diluted share  and net loss of million  or per diluted share  respectively 
in addition to the matters described above  the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and year ended december  asset impairments we recognized a total of million in pretax impairment charges  primarily related to the impairment of assets held for sale and leasehold improvements  as well as other long term assets 
convertible debt offering and debt redemption we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes at par in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act  as amended  which will mature on march   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
in conjunction  we completed the redemption of our then outstanding million face value senior subordinated notes the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  utilizing proceeds from our notes offering 
we incurred a million pretax charge in completing the redemption  consisting primarily of a million redemption premium  a million write off of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs and million of other debt extinguishment costs

year ended december  asset impairments we recognized a total of million in pretax impairment charges  primarily related to the impairment of vacant properties that were held for sale as of december   as well as other long term assets 
gain on debt redemption in  we redeemed a portion of our notes with an aggregate par value of million and  as a result  recognized an million pretax gain and a proportionate reduction in deferred tax assets relative to unamortized costs of the purchased options acquired in conjunction with the initial issuance 
the cost of the options was deductible for tax purposes as an original issue discount 
in conjunction with these repurchases  million of the consideration was attributed to the repurchase of the 
table of contents equity component of the notes and  as such  was recognized as an adjustment to additional paid in capital  net of income taxes 
income tax benefit we recognized an income tax benefit of million as a result of a tax election in that reduced income tax liability that we had previously provided 
non cash interest expense our results were negatively impacted by million of non cash interest expense relative to the amortization of the discount associated with our notes representing the impact of the accounting for convertible debt as required by asc year ended december  asset impairments in the third quarter of  we determined that the economic conditions and resulting impact on the automotive retail industry  as well as the uncertainty surrounding the going concern of the domestic automobile manufacturers  indicated the potential for an impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in response to the identification of such triggering events  we performed an interim impairment assessment of our recorded values of goodwill and intangible franchise rights utilizing our valuation model  which consists of a blend between the market and income approaches 
as a result of such assessment  we determined that the fair values of certain indefinite lived intangible franchise rights were less than their respective carrying values and recorded a pretax charge of million  primarily related to our domestic brand franchises 
further  during the third quarter of  we identified potential impairment indicators relative to certain of our real estate holdings  primarily associated with domestic franchise terminations and other equipment  after giving consideration to the likelihood that certain facilities would not be sold or used by a prospective buyer as an automobile dealership operation given market conditions 
as a result  we performed an impairment assessment of these long lived assets and determined that the respective carrying values exceeded their estimated fair market values  as determined by third party appraisals and brokers opinions of value 
accordingly  we recognized an million pretax asset impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual assessment of impairments relative to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result  we identified additional impairments of our recorded value of intangible franchise rights  primarily attributable to the continued weakening of the us economy  higher market risk premiums  the negative impact of the economic recession on the automotive retail industry and the growing uncertainty surrounding the three domestic automobile manufacturers  all of which worsened between our third and fourth quarter impairment assessments 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in our income approach  we increased our wacc from the one utilized in our impairment assessment during the third quarter of and historical levels 
in addition  because of the negative selling trends experienced in the fourth quarter of  we revised our industry sales outlook  or seasonally adjusted annual rate or saar  from the forecast used in our third quarter assessment 
further  with regards to the assumptions within our market approach  we utilized historical market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue and pretax net income 
these multiples and the resulting fair value estimates were adversely impacted by the declines in stock values during much of  including the fourth quarter 
as a result  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  predominantly related to franchises in our western region 
gain on debt redemption in  we redeemed million in aggregate par value of our notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain 
in addition  we redeemed million in aggregate par value of our notes and  as a result  recognized a million pretax gain and a proportionate reduction in deferred tax assets relative to unamortized costs of the purchased options acquired in conjunction with the initial issuance 
the cost of the options was deductible for tax purposes as an original issue discount 
no value was attributed to the equity component of the notes at the time of the redemption and  therefore  no adjustment to additional paid in capital was recognized 
lease terminations our results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a million pretax charge  related to the termination of a dealership facility lease 
the lease was terminated in conjunction with the relocation of several of our dealership franchises from one to multiple facilities

the following discussion briefly highlights certain of the results and trends occurring within our business 
throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances  which are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
over the course of  the industry experienced a modest increase in the saar of new vehicle units 
while unit sales are still low relative to the years before the recession  unit sales have risen from in to million in this increase is primarily related to the stabilization of the us economic conditions and a growing need to replace aged or scrapped vehicles 
bolstered by this improved sales environment and our recent efforts to gain market share  our new vehicle retail sales increased for the year ended december   over the improvement reflects higher unit sales of for the twelve months ended december   as well as an increase in average sales price driven primarily by improved brand mix and a shift towards more truck sales 
our increase significantly outpaced the national average retail results  which were up for full year  as well as the specific performances of the major brands we represent and the markets in which we operate 
our used vehicle results are directly affected by economic conditions  the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles and new vehicle financing  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
the stabilizing economic environment that benefited new vehicle sales also supported 
table of contents improved used vehicle traffic with our used vehicle retail sales actually increasing faster than new vehicle sales as compared to our results 
as a result  we experienced improving used vehicle volumes throughout when compared to trend industry conditions  we are sourcing a higher percentage of our used vehicles from higher cost auctions instead of trade ins  and this continued to pressure our used vehicle retail margins in further  the wholesale side of the business experienced increases in unit sales and gross profits for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same periods in  largely attributable to the impact of the us government sponsored cash for clunkers program during the latter half of  which significantly reduced older used vehicle inventory 
our consolidated finance and insurance income per retail unit sold pru also increased through the fourth quarter of as compared to  primarily driven by an improvement in finance income per contract and penetration rates in both finance and vehicle service contract offerings 
our total gross margin decreased for the three and twelve months ended december   primarily as a result of the more rapid growth of our new and used vehicle business 
our parts and service sales were positively impacted by our initiatives that are focused on customers  products  and processes 
in addition  our domestic brands benefited from recent closures of competing dealerships in their markets 
and  the manufacturer recalls  particularly the toyota recalls that occurred in early and affected approximately million vehicles  bolstered our parts and service business  representing approximately basis points of the improvement in our revenues 
parts and service margins were enhanced during primarily as a result of additional internal work  resulting from increased new and used vehicle sales  as well as the toyota warranty campaigns that primarily require labor services  which generate higher margins than the corresponding parts sales 
our consolidated sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars  and decreased as a percentage of gross profit by basis points to for  from  primarily as a result of the improved gross profit and our cost rationalization efforts that have resulted in a leaner organization 
these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of the restoration of employee compensation and benefits  the loss on dealership disposal  and redundancy costs in the uk  which occurred during the combination of all of these factors  including million of asset impairments  resulted in an operating margin of for  a basis point increase from our floorplan interest expense increased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in our weighted average outstanding borrowings 
other interest expense decreased in  primarily attributable to decreases in our weighted average outstanding borrowings  and an increase in interest income 
as a result  our pretax margin for increased basis points to as compared to we further address these items  and other variances between the periods presented in the results of operations section below 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to the recent accounting pronouncements section within note  summary of significant accounting polices and estimates  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of those most recent pronouncements that impact us 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates and policies 

table of contents we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note  summary or significant accounting policies and estimates  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies and estimates 
inventories 
we carry new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for parts and accessories or market in the consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus the cost of reconditioning  cost of equipment added and transportation cost 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of the automobile manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our consolidated balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operations as the vehicles are sold 
at december  and  inventory cost had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for interest assistance received from manufacturers 
new vehicle cost of sales has been reduced by million  million and million for interest assistance received related to vehicles sold for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the assistance ranged from approximately to of our quarterly floorplan interest expense over the past three years  with covered in the fourth quarter of as the market value of inventory typically declines over time  we establish new and used vehicle reserves based on our historical loss experience and considerations of current market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
valuation risk is partially mitigated  by the speed at which we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
goodwill 
as of december   we defined our reporting units as each of our three regions in the us and the us goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
annually in the fourth quarter  based on the carrying values of our regions as of october st  we perform a fair value and potential impairment assessment of goodwill 
an impairment analysis is done more frequently if certain events or circumstances arise that would indicate a change in the fair value of the non financial asset has occurred ie  an impairment indicator 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to its respective fair value 
this represents the first step of the impairment test 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets  we are then required to proceed to step two of the impairment test 
step two involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price in a business combination 
to the extent the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value under step two of the impairment test  an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
we use a combination of the discounted cash flow  or income approach weighted  and the market approach weighted to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future sg a expenses and an estimated wacc 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
specifically  with regards to the valuation assumptions utilized in the income approach as of december   we based our analysis on a slow recovery back to normalized levels of saar of million units by for the market approach  we utilize recent market multiples of guideline companies for both revenue weighted and pretax net income weighted 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of the industry  recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
we have concluded that these valuation inputs qualify goodwill to be categorized within level of our asc topic no 
 fair value of measurements and disclosures asc hierarchy framework see note  fair value measurements 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline 
table of contents in the estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting unit s 
intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers  which are recorded at an individual dealership level 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue for an indefinite period and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period and  therefore  the carrying amounts of the franchise rights are not amortized 
franchise rights acquired in business acquisitions prior to july   were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain as part of goodwill at december  and in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
since july   intangible franchise rights acquired in business combinations have been recorded as distinctly separate intangible assets and  in accordance with guidance primarily codified within asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc  we evaluate these franchise rights for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  based on the carrying values of our individual dealerships as of october st  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment has occurred 
in performing our impairment assessments  we test the carrying value of each individual franchise right that was recorded using a direct value method discounted cash flow model  or income approach  specifically the excess earnings method 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future sg a expenses 
using an estimated wacc  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
accordingly  we have concluded that these valuation inputs qualify intangible franchise rights to be categorized within level of the asc hierarchy framework see note  fair value measurements 
if any one of the above assumptions change or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in the intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
see note  asset impairments  and note  intangible franchise rights and goodwill  for additional details regarding our intangible franchise rights 
revenue recognition 
revenues from vehicle sales  parts sales and vehicle service are recognized upon completion of the sale and delivery to the customer 
conditions to completing a sale include having an agreement with the customer  including pricing  and the sales price must be reasonably expected to be collected 
we record the profit we receive for arranging vehicle fleet transactions net in other finance and insurance revenues  net 
since all sales of new vehicles must occur through franchised new vehicle dealerships  the dealerships effectively act as agents for the automobile manufacturers in completing sales of vehicles to fleet customers 
as these customers typically order the vehicles  we have no significant general inventory risk 
additionally  fleet customers generally receive special purchase incentives from the automobile manufacturers and we receive only a nominal fee for facilitating the transactions 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental agencies are not included in total revenues 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining 
table of contents estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed the reserve at december   by million 
we consolidate the operations of our reinsurance companies 
prior to we reinsured the credit life and accident and health insurance policies sold by our dealerships 
during  we terminated our offerings of credit life and accident and health insurance policies  however  some of the previously issued policies remain in force 
all of the revenues and related direct costs from the sales of these policies were deferred and are being recognized over the life of the policies 
investment of the net assets of these companies are regulated by state insurance commissions and consist of permitted investments  in general  government backed securities and obligations of government agencies 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we purchase insurance policies for worker s compensation  liability  auto physical damage  property  pollution  employee medical benefits and other risks consisting of large deductibles and or self insured retentions 
we engage a third party actuary to conduct a study of the exposures under the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs for all open policy years 
this actuarial study is updated on an annual basis  and the appropriate adjustments are made to the accrual 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the actuarially determined loss rate per employee used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed the reserve for these losses at december   by million 
our auto physical damage insurance coverage contains an annual aggregate retention stop loss limit 
for policy years ended prior to october   our workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit the stop loss plans 
due to historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy year beginning november  and for each subsequent year the no stop loss plans 
our exposure per claim under the no stop loss plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of the stop loss plans totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of the amounts paid or accrued  the remaining potential loss exposure under the stop loss plans totals million at december  fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  contracts in transit and vehicle receivables  accounts and notes receivable  investments in debt and equity securities  accounts payable  credit facilities  long term debt and interest rate swaps 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  contracts in transit and vehicle receivables  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  and credit facilities approximate their carrying values due to the short term nature of these instruments or the existence of variable interest rates 
our investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and thus are carried at fair market value 
as of december   the face value of million of our outstanding notes had a carrying value  net of applicable discount  of million  and a fair value  based on quoted market prices  of million 
also  as of december  and  the face value of our outstanding notes was million 
the notes had a carrying value  net of applicable discount  of million and million  respectively  and a fair value  based on quoted market prices  of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair market value 
see notes and for further details regarding our derivative financial instruments and fair value measurements 
we maintain multiple trust accounts comprised of money market funds with short term investments in marketable securities  such as us government securities  commercial paper and bankers acceptances  that have maturities of less than three months 
we determined that the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable 
table of contents securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets  and accordingly  has classified such investments within level of the hierarchy framework as described in asc also within the trust accounts  we hold investments in debt instruments  such as government obligations and other fixed income securities 
these investments are designated as available for sale  measured at fair value and classified as either cash and cash equivalents or other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon maturity terms and certain contractual restrictions 
as these investments are fairly liquid  we believe our fair value techniques accurately reflect their market values and are subject to changes that are market driven and subject to demand and supply of the financial instrument markets 
the valuation measurement inputs of these marketable securities represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and  accordingly  have classified such investments within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note the debt securities are measured based upon quoted market prices utilizing public information  independent external valuations from pricing services or third party advisors 
accordingly  we have concluded the valuation measurement inputs of these debt securities to represent  at their lowest level  quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets where there are few transactions for the assets and have categorized such investments within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note the cost basis of the debt securities  excluding demand obligations  as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are estimated using various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
we utilize third party experts to determine the fair values of property and equipment purchased and our fair value model to determine the fair value of our franchise rights 
derivative financial instruments 
one of our primary market risk exposures is increasing interest rates 
interest rate derivatives are used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions 
we follow the requirements of guidance primarily codified within asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging asc pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
asc requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in interest expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in interest expense 
all of our interest rate hedges were designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed to be effective at december   and we measure interest rate derivative instruments utilizing an income approach valuation technique  converting future amounts of cash flows to a single present value in order to obtain a transfer exit price within the bid and ask spread that is most representative of the fair value of our derivative instruments 
in measuring fair value  the option pricing black scholes present value technique is utilized for all of our derivative instruments 
this option pricing technique utilizes a one month london interbank offered rate libor forward yield curve  obtained from an independent external service provider  matched to the identical maturity term of the instrument being measured 
observable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation technique incorporate identical contractual notional amounts  fixed coupon rates  periodic terms for interest payments and contract maturity 
also included in our fair value estimate is a consideration of credit risk 
because the interest rate derivative instruments were in a liability position  an estimate of our own credit risk was included in the fair value calculation  based upon the spread between the one month libor yield curve and the average and year industrial rate for bb s p rated companies  or  as of december  we have determined the valuation measurement inputs of these derivative instruments to maximize the use of observable inputs that market participants would use in pricing similar or identical instruments and market data obtained from independent sources  which is readily observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the derivative instrument 
further  the valuation measurement inputs minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
accordingly  we have classified the derivatives within level of the asc hierarchy framework in note we validate the outputs of our valuation technique by comparison to valuations from the respective counterparties 

table of contents income taxes 
currently  we operate in different states in the us and in the us  each of which has unique tax rates and payment calculations 
as the amount of income generated in each jurisdiction varies from period to period  our estimated effective tax rate can vary based on the proportion of taxable income generated in each jurisdiction 
deferred income taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the underlying assets are realized or liabilities are settled 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each tax position must satisfy a threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements see note  income taxes  for additional information 
we have recognized deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  that we believe will be realized  based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
to the extent that we have determined that net income attributable to certain state jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize certain net operating losses  a corresponding valuation allowance has been established 
discontinued operations 
on june   we sold certain operations constituting our entire dealership holdings in one particular market that qualified for discontinued operations accounting and reporting treatment 
in order to reflect these operations as discontinued  the necessary reclassifications have been made to our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us

table of contents the following table sets forth our top same store brands  based on retail unit sales volume and the percentage changes from year to year  which we believe  in total  has outpaced the overall retail market performance of those brands in the areas where we operated in same store new vehicle unit sales for the year ended december  change change toyota nissan honda ford bmw mercedes benz lexus chevrolet acura mini other total the economic slowdown that began in in the us resulted in declining new vehicle sales over much of the past two years 
as us economic conditions have recently begun to stabilize  most of our new vehicle brands generated improved sales 
with the stabilized selling environment  a number of our improvement efforts have been focused on enhancing the effectiveness of our sales processes and capturing market share 
we achieved increases in same store unit sales and revenues increases for most of the major brands that we represent that exceeded the national retail results for these brands 
same store revenues from our import and luxury brands increased and from to  on and more retail units  respectively 
our same store unit sales in our truck heavy domestic franchises increased from to  while revenues increased over the same period 
overall  our retail car unit sales increased by in  while our retail truck unit sales increased by  as compared with the same period in for the year ended december   same store new vehicle unit sales and revenues increased and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding period in  which outpaced industry increases 
the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share during future periods  is difficult to predict 
for the year ended december   same store new vehicle unit sales and revenues declined and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding period in  which was generally consistent with industry declines 
the combination of slowing economic conditions  declining consumer confidence  higher jobless rates  tightened credit standards and industry wide pressure to lower vehicle inventory levels led to lower sales and extremely competitive pricing 
partially offsetting these negative economic conditions throughout was the impact of the cars program  which had a positive effect on our third quarter results 
we sold  qualifying new vehicle units under the cars program 
for  we experienced unit sales decreases in each of the major brands that we represent 
our retail car unit sales declined by in  while our retail truck unit sales declined by  as compared with the same period in we believe that our performance was generally consistent with national retail results of the brands we represent and the overall markets in which we operate 
for the year ended december   compared to  our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points 
at the same time  our same store gross pru declined to  representing a decline for our import brands that was partially offset by a increase for our domestic brands and a increase for our luxury brands 

table of contents our same store gross margin on new vehicle retail sales decreased basis points from to the rapid fall off in demand across the nation led to significant build ups of new vehicle inventories across all brands  putting significant pressure on margins in the first half of in addition the bankruptcies of chrysler and general motors further pressured margins as dealers moved aggressively to reduce their inventories of these brands 
for the year ended december  compared to  our same store gross profit pru declined to  representing a decrease for our domestic brands and a decline for our luxury brands 
gross profit pru for our import brands in was consistent with prior year 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the mix of units being sold  as domestic brands tend to provide more assistance  the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and market interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
to further mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million effective at december   at a weighted average one month libor interest rate of 
we record the majority of the impact of the periodic settlements of these swaps as a component of floorplan interest expense  effectively hedging a substantial portion of our total floorplan interest expense and mitigating the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  in this depressed interest rate environment  our interest assistance recognized as a percent of total floorplan interest expense has declined 
over the past three years  this assistance as a percentage of our total consolidated floorplan interest expense has ranged from in the fourth quarter of to in the third quarter of this assistance covered in the fourth quarter of we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
we continue to aggressively manage our new vehicle inventory in response to the rapidly changing market conditions 
coupled with the improved selling environment  we increased our new vehicle inventory levels by million  or  from million as of december  to million as of december  our consolidated days supply of new vehicle inventory increased to days at december  from days at december

the improved economic conditions  uptick in consumer confidence and healthier new vehicle selling environment have translated into an increase in used vehicle traffic 
this resulted in increases in our same store used retail unit sales and in our same store used retail revenues of and  respectively  in as compared to our average sales price pru increased during the twelve months ended december  our certified pre owned cpo volume increased to  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of  corresponding to the overall lift in used retail volume 
as a percentage of total retail sales  cpo units increased to represent of total used retail units in as compared to in new vehicle trade ins and lease turn ins are our best source of quality used vehicles 
despite the increase in new vehicle volumes  used vehicle retail sales volumes substantially outpaced new vehicles sales  and the sourcing of quality used vehicles continues to be a challenge 
this has caused us to source a higher percentage of our inventory from auctions  generally at higher prices  as we are forced to bid against other dealers instead of negotiated prices paid on trade ins 
as a result  gross profit per used retail unit decreased in  as compared to and our same store used retail vehicle margins declined basis points to 
price relativities between new and used vehicles also continued to pressure used retail vehicle margins 
during  the same economic and consumer confidence issues that slowed our new vehicle business also negatively impacted used vehicle sales  and as a result our same store used retail unit sales and revenues declined 
table of contents and  respectively  as compared to further  since the new vehicle business is our best source of used vehicle inventory and that business suffered a sustained slowdown  we were more challenged to source used vehicles profitably for our customers 
and  even though the cars program resulted in an influx of new vehicle customers during the third quarter of  sourcing of used retail inventory was not improved due to the nature of the cars program  which required all trade ins to be destroyed 
despite the challenging economic times  we continued to improve our cpo volume as a percentage of total retail sales in compared to cpo units represented of total same store used retail units for as compared to in as a combined result  our same store retail used vehicle gross profit pru decreased from  in to  in  while our same store gross margin decreased basis points over the same period 
with the increase in new vehicle sales and trade in activity  we also experienced an increase in our wholesale used vehicles sales of on more units for while wholesaling more vehicles seems inconsistent with our need for more used vehicle inventory  most of the vehicles that we sent to auction to be wholesaled were of relatively lower value  higher mileage and older age than their retail counterparts  which is indicative of the recent increase in age of the units in operation 
as used vehicle values have begun to stabilize  our wholesale gross profits per unit have begun to return to more normal levels 
we would expect the wholesale gross profit per unit to continue to trend closer to break even  with stable used vehicle values and supply 
during  our same store wholesale unit sales decreased from to to  units  while same store wholesale revenues decreased to million for the same period 
the overall increase in used vehicle profits for was reflective of an improvement in used vehicle wholesale values  resulting from a general supply shortage and increased dealer demand  partially offset by lower retail results 
because of the limited availability of quality used vehicles  the price of vehicles sold at auction increased  leading to higher profits and margins in our wholesale vehicles 
we continuously work to optimize our used vehicle inventory levels to provide adequate supply and selection 
our days supply of used vehicle inventory remained at days for both december  and december  this was an increase from days at december  parts and service data dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change change parts and service revenues same stores transactions total gross profit same stores transactions total gross margin same stores transactions total our same store parts and service revenues increased during  primarily driven by a increase in warranty parts and service revenues and a increase in customer pay parts and service sales 
we also generated a increase in wholesale parts sales and a increase in our collision revenues 
the improvement in our same store warranty parts and service revenue as compared to was primarily driven by the toyota recalls that began during the first quarter of  which affected approximately million 
table of contents vehicles 
the two major recalls included the floormat accelerator recall  which affected approximately million toyota and lexus vehicles  and the sticky accelerator pedal recall  which affected approximately million toyota vehicles 
there were approximately million units that were impacted by both recalls 
these recalls accounted for basis points of the increase in parts and service revenues 
generally  we have begun to see an uptick in warranty related activity 
total recall volumes increased in we believe that this is due to heightened manufacturer sensitivity to potential product defects and increased regulatory scrutiny by the government 
as such  we expect that this trend in warranty business will continue into the foreseeable future 
the increase in same store customer pay parts and service revenues was primarily driven by our domestic brand dealerships and attributable to markets with recent domestic dealership closures 
our same store wholesale parts business increased in benefiting from recent improvements in business processes  and an increase in business with second tier collision centers and repair shops  which was stimulated by the stabilization in the economy  as well as the closure of surrounding dealerships 
our collision revenues also improved during  as a result of enhanced business processes and the opening of additional capacity 
same store parts and service gross profit increased from to  while same store parts and service margins increased basis points to 
these improvements were primarily a result of internal work generated by the increase in new and used retail vehicle sales volumes and the increased warranty work generated by the two major toyota recalls 
these recall campaigns consist predominantly of labor services  which produce higher margins than the corresponding parts sales  and are comparable to our customer pay business 
our same store parts and service revenues decreased during  primarily driven by a decrease in wholesale parts sales and a decline in customer pay parts and service sales  as well as a decline in warranty parts and service sales and a decline in collision revenues 
the decline in our same store warranty parts and service revenues was primarily the result of certain manufacturer quality issues in that were rectified in our same store wholesale parts business declined in primarily due to the negative impact of the economy on many of the second tier collision centers and mechanical repair shops with which we do business and our decision to tighten our credit standards in this area 
the decline in our customer pay parts and service business during was primarily driven by lighter traffic in our domestic brand dealerships 
same store collision revenues were negatively impacted in by the closure of a body shop facility in our eastern region 
same store parts and service gross profit for decreased from  while our parts and service margins decreased basis points to 
these decreases were primarily due to the negative impact of declining new and used vehicle sales on our internal parts and service volume

in addition  we experienced increases in finance income per contract and increases in both finance and vehicle service contract penetration rates during the increase in our finance penetration rate was primarily driven by the increase in manufacturer financing promotions as well as the negative impact of the cars program on finance penetration rates in the third quarter of as a disproportionate number of the cars customers paid cash for their vehicle purchase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in penetration rate of our maintenance and road hazard product offerings  as well as an increase in our chargeback expense

additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  we assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser our interests in any real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  we retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance by us required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
we may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease 
however  we presently have no reason to believe that we will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we are a party at december   and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in these rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
interest rates 
we have interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
our policy is to monitor the effects of market changes in interest rates and manage our interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of our notes and notes totaled million and million  respectively  and had a fair value of million and million respectively 
the carrying amount of our notes and notes was million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding  million of variable rate mortgage facility borrowings and million of other variable rate real estate related borrowings outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount of variable rate borrowings outstanding as of 
table of contents december   and before the impact of our interest rate swaps described below  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps currently under contract that are described below  a basis point increase would yield a net annual change of million 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility and variable rate mortgage facility and real estate related borrowings to fixed rate debt 
as of december   we held interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of million that fixed our underlying one month libor at a weighted average fixed rate of 
interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of million and a weighted average fixed interest rate of expired in december the fair value of the interest rate swaps is impacted by the forward one month libor interest rate curve and the length of time to maturity of the swap contract 
during  we entered into an interest rate swap with a million notional value  effective in january with expiration in august  effectively locking in a rate of 
at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled million 
as of december   our liability associated with these interest rate swaps decreased from million as of december  to million  primarily as a result of the expiration of the million notional amounts noted above 
at december   all of our derivative contracts were determined to be effective  and no significant ineffective portion was recognized in income during the period 
we reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated vehicle is sold 
during the years ended december  and december   we recognized million and million of interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense  with covered in the fourth quarter of although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiaries is the pound sterling 
accordingly  our foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the us dollar against the pound sterling and are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and other income expense  when applicable 
we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations and  as such  do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations that may impact our investment in the uk subsidiaries 
if we change our intent with respect to this international investment  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a change in average exchange rates for the pound sterling versus the us dollar would have resulted in a million change to our revenues for the year ended december
