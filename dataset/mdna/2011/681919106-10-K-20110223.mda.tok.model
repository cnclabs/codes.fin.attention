item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  of this report 
none of our acquisitions or dispositions in  or were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for information concerning our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
geographic regions and segments our revenue is almost evenly divided between our us and us operations 
for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting  see our md a and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our clients consistent with our fundamental business strategy  our agencies serve similar clients  in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients  across a variety of geographic regions and locations 
our clients participate in virtually every industry sector of the global economy 
furthermore  in many cases  our agencies or networks serve different brand and or product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks 
for example  our largest client was served by more than of our agencies in and represented of our revenue 
no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients ranked by revenue were each served  on average  by more than of our agencies in and collectively represented of our revenue 
our employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements 
the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar 
common to all is the ability to understand a client s brand or product and their selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
recognizing the importance of this core competency  we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency

risk factors future global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 
in  our revenue increased compared to the increase reflects an improvement in business conditions in our industry over however  the pace of the global economic recovery is uneven and a future economic downturn could renew reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client spending and other factors  and will take actions available to us to improve our cost structure and manage working capital 
in the current environment there can be no assurance of the effects of future economic conditions  client spending patterns  client creditworthiness and other developments on us and whether or to what extent our efforts to respond will be effective 
conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors  including us 
if that were to occur  we may require additional financing to fund our day to day working capital requirements 
there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
in a period of severe economic downturn  the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services provided 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
the media commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
in addition  our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients 
we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services 
we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance 
however  the agreements entered into  as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client 
the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn 
such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital 
the recent global recession caused a reduction in the volume of client spending and or a delay in the time our clients took to pay us  negatively affecting our working capital 
renewed global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to take the same or additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital 
consequently  we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such circumstances could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
companies periodically review and change their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships 
if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs  the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients  particularly large international clients  on a broad geographic basis 
while many of our client relationships are long standing  from time to time clients put their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review 
we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews 
to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients  our revenue may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships  retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce 
our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may  in some cases  be limited by clients perceptions of  or policies concerning  conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships 
if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests  our business  results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
our employees are our most important assets 
our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected  which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
further  as the evolution of our business continues to become integrated with the digital marketplace  we are increasingly dependent on the technical skills of a highly skilled workforce and their ability to maintain the skills necessary to serve our clients 
we received approximately of our revenue from our largest clients in  and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason 
it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns  or they could reduce future spending 
a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients  or the loss of several of our largest clients  if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients  would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we rely extensively on information technology systems 
we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions  summarize results and manage our business  including maintaining client marketing and advertising strategies 
the size and complexity of our technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown  malicious intrusion and random attack 
likewise  data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology systems  there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our reputation or business 
government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services  which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope  content and manner of presentation of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services  through regulation or other governmental action 
any limitation on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices 
such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future 
government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services 
these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
laws and regulations  related to user privacy  use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets 
these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of the internet as an advertising medium 
these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and foreign exchange controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we face a number of risks normally associated with global services businesses 
the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions  competition for client assignments and talented staff  new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations 
the risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and foreign exchange controls  do not affect domestic focused firms 
these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position 
for financial information on our operations by geographic area  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 
we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world 
some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include slower payment of invoices  nationalization  social  political and economic instability  and currency repatriation restrictions 
in addition  commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague  inconsistently administered and retroactively applied 
if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business  our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed  which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to million of notes  in whole or in part  at specified dates in the future 
in august  million of our convertible notes due july  notes may be put back to us for repurchase and in june  million of our convertible notes due july  notes may be put back to us for repurchase 
if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts 
we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our credit facility to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any put 
however  in the event that our credit facility or our cash flow from operations were to decrease  we may need to seek additional funding 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms  if at all 
downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt bbb  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility  however  would increase if our long term debt credit rating is downgraded 
additionally  our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short term or long term debt credit ratings 
furthermore  the notes and notes are convertible at specified ratios if  in the case of the notes  our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs 
as part of the evaluation  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 
as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
goodwill may become impaired 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap or gaap  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities  which principally represents the specialized know how of the workforce at the acquired businesses 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows 
while we have concluded  for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report  that our goodwill is not impaired  future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired 
any resulting non cash impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 
although our businesses may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions  we could be in the future 
however  we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers 
additionally  to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations  we may need to incur additional costs 
at this time  we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a strategic holding company 
we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world 
on a global  pan regional and local basis  our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients 
while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines  we organize our services around our clients 
the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we deliver our services and allocate our resources 
this client centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client s specific marketing requirements 
we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client centric approach  as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients 
in addition  we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses with strong  entrepreneurial management teams that typically currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 
as one of the world s leading advertising  marketing and corporate communications companies  we operate in all major markets of the global economy 
we have a large and diverse client base 
our largest client represented of our revenue and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients accounted for of our revenue 
our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than of our revenue from our  largest clients 
although our revenue is generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base  we are not immune to general economic downturns 
in  our revenue increased compared to the increase reflects an improvement in business conditions in our industry over revenue increased across all our disciplines driven by economic recovery in the us and continued growth in the emerging markets in asia and latin america 
in europe  we experienced a moderate increase in revenue in the uk  while economic recovery has lagged in our euro markets 
we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client spending and other factors and  in response  take actions available to us to improve our cost structure and manage working capital 
in the current economic environment  there can be no assurance as to the effects on us of future economic conditions  client spending patterns  client creditworthiness and other developments and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond will be effective 
certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry 
these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non traditional marketing channels  as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets 
additionally  in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets  clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 
we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and  over the medium and long term  will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 
in  barring unforeseen events and excluding foreign exchange impacts  we expect our revenues to increase as a result of continuing increases in client spending and the contribution of several small acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of we will continue to identify acquisition candidates that will build upon the core capabilities of our strategic business platforms  expand our operations in the emerging markets and enhance our capabilities to leverage new technologies 
in early february  we acquired a controlling interest in the clemenger group  our affiliate in australia and new zealand 
the additional acquired brings our ownership up to almost 
in connection with this transaction  in the first quarter of we expect to record a non cash gain of approximately million resulting from the remeasurement of the carrying value of our equity interest to the acquisition date fair value 
we believe that this acquisition will help us further develop our combined businesses throughout the asia pacific region 
we have an objective of improving margins to levels 
in connection with achieving this goal  we are in the process of a strategic review of our businesses that is focused on improving our strategic position and operations 
as part of this process  we are evaluating our agencies to identify non core and underperforming businesses that need to be repositioned or considered for disposal 
we expect that these actions will reduce revenue in the range of million to million on an annual basis 
we believe that on an annual basis  the reduction in revenue will approximately equal the increase in revenue from our recent acquisitions 
we are also pursuing numerous operational consolidations to further drive efficiencies in our back office functions 
as a result of the actions to be taken in connection with our strategic review  in the first quarter of we expect to incur charges ranging from million to million for severance  lease termination and asset impairment costs 
given our size and breadth  we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators 
the key indicators that we analyze are revenue and operating expenses 
we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  growth by discipline  growth from currency fluctuations  growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients  and growth by client industry group 
in recent years  our revenue has been divided almost evenly between our domestic and international operations 
in  our revenue increased  of which was related to changes in foreign exchange rates  was related to acquisitions  net of dispositions and was from organic growth 
across our geographic markets revenue increased in the us  in the us and in our other markets  primarily asia and latin america  while in our euro markets revenue decreased 
the increase in revenue in compared to  in our four fundamental disciplines was traditional media advertising   crm   public relations  and specialty communications  
we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs  and office and general expenses 
salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs  technology costs  depreciation and amortization and other overhead expenses 
each of our agencies requires professionals with a skill set that is similar across our disciplines 
at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client s brand or product and their selling proposition  and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue 
salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue 
salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to in compared to in the increase in salary and service costs resulted primarily from a combination of a change in our business mix and increased compensation costs  primarily related to freelance labor and incentive compensation  partially offset by a decrease in severance costs 
office and general expenses are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs 
office and general expenses decreased to of revenue in compared to in net income omnicom group inc in increased million or to million from million in the period over period increase in net income omnicom group inc is principally due to the factors described above  partially offset by an increase in pre tax net interest expense for of million 
diluted net income per common share omnicom group inc increased to in  as compared to in the prior year period 
the year over year increase in diluted net income per common share omnicom group inc is due to the factors described above as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding 
this reduction was the result of our purchases of our common stock during  net of stock option exercise and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
critical accounting policies and new accounting standards critical accounting policies we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related discussion in this md a 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  including our discussion in note setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail  for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below 
estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets  accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment and when evaluating our cost method investments to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
acquisitions and goodwill we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions 
in making acquisitions  the price we pay is based on an evaluation of various factors  including specialized know how  reputation  competitive position  geographic coverage and service offerings  as well as our experience and judgment 
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and  accordingly  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
in circumstances where control is obtained and less than of an entity is acquired  we record of the goodwill acquired 
acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred 
any liability for contingent purchase price obligations earn outs are recorded at the acquisition date at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the earn out liability are recorded in our results of operations 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the acquisition date 
in  we completed seven acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in businesses in which we had an existing minority ownership interest 
total goodwill additions from these transactions were million 
in addition and unrelated to the acquisitions completed in  we made or accrued contingent purchase price payments of million  which were included in goodwill 
a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january  is discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
the amount of contingent purchase price obligations is based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations for acquisitions completed prior to january  are accrued  in accordance with us gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 
our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and or their service capabilities to better serve our clients 
additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know how of the acquisition targets 
accordingly  as is typical in most service businesses  a substantial portion of the intangible asset value we acquire is the know how of the people  which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued separately 
for each acquisition  we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets 
a significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships  including the related customer contracts  as well as trade names 
in valuing these identified intangible assets  we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 
the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year 
we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments  which are our five agency networks 
the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region 
they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions 
we have concluded that for each of our operating segments  their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level 
our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in the asc 
consistent with our fundamental business strategy  the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs associated with providing professional services and office and general costs  which include rent and occupancy costs  technology costs that are generally limited to purchased computers  servers and off the shelf software and other overhead costs 
finally  the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
estimates and assumptions goodwill impairment review we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows  comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and when available  consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions 
in applying the income approach  we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows dcf for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin  ebitda  tax rates  capital expenditures  weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long term cash flow growth rates 
all these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses  economic conditions related to the industry in which we operate  as well as conditions in the global economy 
the assumptions which have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are the expected long term growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the range of assumptions used for the long term growth rate and wacc in our evaluation as of june  and were june long term growth rate wacc long term growth rates represent our estimate of a conservative long term growth rate for the industry in which we operate and the global economy 
the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past nine years was approximately and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue average nominal gdp was over the same period 
we considered this history when determining the long term growth rates to be used in our annual impairment test at june  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp 
we also believe  based on our historical performance  that our long term growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth 
for our annual test as of june   beginning in  we used an estimated long term growth rate of for all of our reporting units 
when performing our annual impairment test as of june  and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units  we also considered the changes in the economic outlook in mid year we experienced an increase in our revenue in the first half of of  of which was due to foreign exchange movements 
this led us to estimate growth rates for the subsequent five years that reflect current business conditions and increase gradually throughout this period 
the risk adjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated wacc for each of our reporting units 
the wacc is comprised of a risk free rate of return  a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market  an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units  and the current after tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units  each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 
the reduction in the wacc used at june  compared to june  was primarily the result of a decrease in the long term us treasury bond  the risk free rate of return used 
sensitivity analysis and conclusion goodwill impairment review consistent with our fundamental business strategy  the agencies within our reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs associated with providing professional services  and office and general costs  which include rent and occupancy costs  technology costs and other overhead costs 
our reporting units do vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them 
these differences drive the variations in fair value among our reporting units 
in addition  these differences as well as differences in book value  including goodwill  cause the variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units 
the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded 
the remaining two agency networks  including reporting unit  were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result  they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 
the decline in the fair value of our reporting units that would need to occur in order to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test the threshold is as follows dollars in millions june  june  reporting units goodwill threshold goodwill threshold and   and   based on the analysis described above  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of june  because the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 
notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and long term growth rate are reasonable  we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units 
the results of this sensitivity analysis for our annual impairment test as of june  revealed that if our wacc was increased by  and or our long term growth rate was decreased by  the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and pass step one of the impairment test 
we plan to continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless certain events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment 
the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations  but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  but they are subject to change from period to period 
actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material 
a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  including its goodwill 
a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition  and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour or equivalent basis 
revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record revenue net of sales  use and value added taxes 
certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 
these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
more specifically  our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery  performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement  and collection is reasonably assured 
because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways  all of the key elements in revenue recognition apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 
in the majority of our businesses  we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities  the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf 
in these cases  costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 
in certain arrangements  we act as principal and we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and third party production costs and are responsible for payment 
in these arrangements  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 
a portion of our client contractual arrangements include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 
additional information about our revenue recognition policy appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee share based compensation employee share based compensation is measured at the grant date fair value based on the fair value of the award 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of share based compensation awards 
this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value  our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note to our consolidated financial statements

net interest expense our net interest expense increased to million in  as compared to million in gross interest expense decreased million to million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper issuances that substantially offset the increased interest resulting from our senior notes issued on july  our gross interest income decreased million to million in this decrease was attributable to lower investment rates and foreign exchange impacts on the interest earned on our foreign cash balances 
see liquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was  which is slightly higher than our rate of 
the increase in our effective tax rate was caused by higher foreign taxes  including a tax expense incurred in of million due to the resolution of an uncertain tax position for a foreign subsidiary 
this was substantially offset by a reduction in income tax expense in of million from the recognition of foreign income tax credits 
net income per common share omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons  our net income omnicom group inc in decreased million  or  to million from  million in diluted net income per common share omnicom group inc decreased to in  as compared to in the prior year 
this period over period decrease was smaller than the decrease in net income omnicom group inc due to the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources cash sources and requirements  including contractual obligations historically  the majority of our non discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and short term investments 
working capital is our principal non discretionary funding requirement 
in addition  we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes  our recurring business operations  primarily related to lease obligations  as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 
our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders  payments for strategic acquisitions  capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock 
our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and short term investments 
in addition  depending on the level of discretionary spending  we may use other sources of available funding  such as the issuance of commercial paper and borrowing under our credit facility or other long term borrowings to finance these activities 
however  we expect that over the course of we should be able to fund both our discretionary and non discretionary cash requirements without incurring additional long term debt 
we have a seasonal cash requirement  peaking during the second quarter  primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation  income taxes and contingent acquisition obligations 
this typically will result in a net borrowing requirement that decreases over the course of the year 
we expect that all our treasury centers will have cash invested at the end of the calendar year 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from december  the components of the increase in are dollars in millions sources cash flow from operations  less change in working capital principal cash sources  uses capital expenditures dividends paid acquisition payments  including contingent acquisition obligations of  net of cash acquired repurchase of common stock of  net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold to our employee stock purchase plan of and tax benefits of  principal discretionary cash uses  discretionary cash uses in excess of principal cash sources exchange rate changes financing activities and other add back change in working capital increase in cash and cash equivalents principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts are non gaap financial measures

this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information presented in compliance with us gaap 
non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 
cash management we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our regional treasury centers in north america  europe and asia 
the regional treasury centers are managed by our wholly owned finance subsidiaries 
each day  operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center 
likewise  operations that require funding borrow funds from their regional treasury center 
the treasury centers aggregate the net position  which is either invested with or borrowed from third parties 
to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity  they have the ability to access local currency uncommitted lines of credit  our billion credit facility or  depending on market conditions at the time  issue up to billion of us dollar denominated commercial paper 
this process enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and effectively utilize our cash  as well as better manage our risk to foreign exchange changes 
in certain countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis  we arrange for uncommitted local credit lines in those countries 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million and our short term investments increased million from the prior year 
short term investments principally consist of time deposits with financial institutions that we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle  generally within one year 
at december   million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in the united states and the remainder was held internationally  primarily in canada  the united kingdom and hong kong 
the majority of our offshore cash is available to us as a source of funds  net of any tax obligations or assessments 
unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are considered to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
in managing our day to day liquidity and our long term capital structure  we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds 
we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings 
determination of the amount of this tax liability is based on the rate differential of the us income taxes in excess of the foreign taxes on any remittances of the undistributed earnings and is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 
changes in us tax rules and regulations covering international operations and foreign tax credits may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
during  we opportunistically accessed the capital markets and issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due august  and repurchased million of our convertible notes 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased million from the prior year end 
as a result  our net debt position  which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and short term investments  increased million as compared to the prior year end  as follows dollars in millions debt short term borrowings due less than one year commercial paper senior notes due april    senior notes due july  senior notes due august   convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt unamortized discount on senior notes fair value hedge adjustment on senior notes due total debt   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  net debt net debt is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this presentation  together with the comparable us gaap measures  reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management

non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants in december  we entered into a new credit facility expiring on december  with a consortium of banks led by citibank  jpmorgan chase and bank of america providing borrowing capacity of up to billion as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility replaced our billion credit facility that was due to expire in june our credit facility provides support for our commercial paper issuances  as well as back up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us 
during and  we repurchased a total of  million of convertible notes that were put 
at december   the outstanding convertible notes totaled million 
depending on market conditions at the time  we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper  borrowing under our uncommitted lines of credit or borrowing under our credit facility 
for the three years ended december   commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed credit facility were dollars in millions commercial paper average amount outstanding during the year maximum amount outstanding during the year  total borrowings during the year   amount outstanding at december weighted average interest rate average days outstanding committed credit facility average amount outstanding during the year maximum amount outstanding during the year  total borrowings during the year   amount outstanding at december weighted average interest rate average days outstanding the combined maximum amount outstanding for our commercial paper and credit facility borrowings was  million for   million for and  million for at december   short term borrowings of million outstanding were comprised of bank overdrafts and credit lines by our international subsidiaries 
the bank overdrafts and credit lines are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the bank agreements supporting the facilities 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreement 
these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to no more than times 
in addition  we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least times 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants  as our ratio of debt to ebitda was times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was times 
in addition  our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 
in august  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due august  the proceeds from the issuance before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses were million 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt bbb  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt credit ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes due april   senior notes due july   senior notes due august  collectively senior notes  convertible notes and credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded 
the interest rates and fees on our credit facility  however  will increase if our long term debt credit ratings are lowered 
our senior notes and convertible notes were co issued by us and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries  omnicom capital inc oci and omnicom finance inc ofi  as co obligors 
our senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co obligors and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes and the convertible notes 
our senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
oci and ofi provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries 
oci and ofi s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable 
there are no restrictions in the senior notes or convertible note indentures on the ability of oci  ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends  loans or advances 
in june  we amended the indenture relating to our notes to permit us to redeem our notes on june  and june  after june   we can redeem the notes at any time 
additionally  holders of million of our notes agreed to waive their right to contingent cash interest  if payable  from december  through and including december  holders of million of our notes did not put their notes to us for purchase and did not consent to the amendments and million aggregate principal amount of the notes were repurchased and retired 
in august  we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april  notes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
under the terms of these agreements  we will receive fixed interest rate payments and will make variable interest rate payments on the total principal amount of the notes 
these agreements effectively convert the notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt from the inception of the swaps through the maturity of the notes 
the swaps qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes at inception and at december  and are designated as a fair value hedge on the notes 
the variable interest rate we pay is based on the one month and three month us libor rate  flat 
the fixed rate we receive is 
the swaps mature on april   the same day as the notes 
the swaps are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value and the change in the fair value of the swaps and the change in the fair value of the notes the hedged item are recorded in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense 
we will continue to evaluate these arrangements for hedge accounting treatment 
at december   we recorded a liability of million representing the fair value of the swaps and we also recorded a decrease in the carrying value of the notes of million reflecting the change in fair value of the notes from the inception of the fair value hedge 
the net change in fair value of the swap and the carrying value of the notes and any hedge ineffectiveness was not material to our results of operations 
from time to time  we have made non contractual supplemental interest payments to holders of our convertible notes who did not put their notes back to us for repurchase on the respective put date or who agreed to certain amendments to the convertible note indentures 
the supplemental interest payments are amortized to interest expense ratably over the period to the next put date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
holders of our convertible notes exercised their right to put their notes to us for repurchase at par on the respective put date 
for the two years ended december   the following repurchases were made dollars in millions notes notes notes at december   outstanding debt and amounts available under our credit facility were dollars in millions debt outstanding available credit short term borrowings due in less than one year commercial paper issued under billion credit facility due december   senior notes due april   senior notes due july  senior notes due august   convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt unamortized discount on senior notes fair value hedge adjustment on senior notes due total   looking forward to  we expect to continue to use our cash flow from operations to pay dividends and make capital expenditures  as well as to repurchase our common stock and fund acquisitions 
additional information about our indebtedness is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
credit markets and availability of credit in december  we entered into a new three year credit facility providing borrowing capacity of billion 
the credit facility replaced our billion credit facility that was due to expire in june during the term of the prior credit facility  a maximum of billion of our convertible notes could have been put back to us 
during the term of the new credit facility  a maximum of million of convertible notes can be put back to us 
accordingly  we decreased the amount of our new credit facility by million to billion 
we believe the reduced amount is sufficient to satisfy the potential put of the total amount of convertible notes outstanding  as well as provide the required support for issuances under our billion commercial paper program 
we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures 
we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients 
we believe that these actions  in addition to the availability of our billion credit facility  are sufficient to fund our near term working capital needs and our discretionary spending 
for additional information about our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in funding our day to day liquidity  we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market 
we expect to continue funding our day to day liquidity need through the commercial paper market 
however  prior disruptions in the credit markets led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads 
during these periods of disruption  to mitigate these conditions and to fund our day to day liquidity  we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any future disruptions in the credit markets 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of business 
the following tables should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations at december  are dollars in millions obligation due total obligation after long term notes payable   interest on long term notes payable  convertible notes lease obligations  uncertain tax positions contractual commitments at december  are dollars in millions commitment expires total commitment after standby letters of credit guarantees the liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid 
we have assigned the liability to the period s presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 
holders of the convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future 
the next date holders of our notes may put the notes back to us for cash is august the next date on which holders of our notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date million of convertible notes could be due in and million could be due in at december   we classified our convertible notes as long term in our consolidated balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until december and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation  then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
in addition  our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients 
we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services 
we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance 
however  the agreements entered into  as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client 
we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients 
however  the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn 
pension and postemployment funding the unfunded benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans and postemployment arrangements at december  was million 
during  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans and paid million in benefits for our postemployment arrangements 
we do not expect these payments to increase significantly in contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations  often referred to as earn outs 
we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired business during the post acquisition transition period 
these payments are not contingent upon future employment 
at december   the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for acquisitions completed prior to january   assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  is approximately million 
the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with us gaap  we have not recorded a liability for these items in our consolidated balance sheet since the definitive amount was not determinable or distributable prior to january  actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates 
our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period  changes in the performance of the acquired businesses and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these differences could be significant 
the contingent purchase price obligations as of december   calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  are dollars in millions total contingent purchase price obligations related to acquisitions completed subsequent to december  are recorded as liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at each reporting period 
changes in fair value of the liability are recorded in our results of operations 
these liabilities are not included in the above amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business  we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposure  derivatives are used to manage the related cost of debt 
for foreign currency exposure  derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result of using derivative instruments  we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counterparty credit risk  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors 
we evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments 
we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value at risk analysis 
value at risk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments 
the value at risk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at december  indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial 
foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations  which are generally denominated in the local currency 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations 
while our agencies conduct business in more than different currencies  our major non us currency markets are the european monetary union emu  the united kingdom  japan  brazil and canada 
as an integral part of our treasury operations  we centralize our cash and use a multicurrency pool arrangement to manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of the treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds 
in certain circumstances  instead of using a multicurrency pool  operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with an intercompany treasury center operating in a different currency 
to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions  we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of  million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments 
furthermore  we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency 
in these instances  amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of million related to these activities 
the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks 
these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program 
as a result of these financial instruments  we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 
interest rate risk from time to time  we issue debt in the capital markets 
in  to manage our overall interest cost  we used interest rate swaps to convert specific fixed rate debt into variable rate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps 
at december   the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was billion 
the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount outstanding 
the next date on which holders of our notes can put the notes back to us for cash is august and the next date on which holders of our notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june as we have done on prior occasions  we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us 
if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment  the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date  including our stock price  short term interest rates and a factor for credit risk 
if our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put 
additionally  if the convertible notes are put back to us  our interest expense will change 
the extent  if any  of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced  when we refinance  the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 
even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar for dollar basis  it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio 
if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest bearing debt at prevailing rates  this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios  such as ebitda to interest expense 
however  the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds 
if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to increase or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was to halve  we would still be in compliance with these covenants 
therefore  based on our current coverage ratios  our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets  we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements 
credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients 
due to the diversified nature of our client base  we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for of our revenue  and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue for however  during periods of economic downturn  the credit profiles of our clients could change 
in the normal course of business  we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide 
many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
in addition  our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients 
we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services 
we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance 
however  the agreements entered into  as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client 
we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or on production costs incurred on behalf of our clients 
however  the risk of a material loss could increase in a significant economic downturn
