item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general nobility s primary focus is homebuyers who generally purchase their manufactured homes from retail sales centers to locate on property they own 
nobility has aggressively pursued this market through its prestige retail sales centers 
while nobility actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers  its presence as a competitor limits potential sales to dealers located in the same geographic areas serviced by its prestige retail sales centers 
nobility has also aggressively targeted the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees moving to florida and typically purchasing homes to be located on sites leased from park communities offering a variety of amenities 
sales are not limited by the presence of the company s prestige retail sales centers in this type of arrangement  as the retirement community sells homes only within their community 
nobility has a product line of approximately active models 
although market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  the manufacturing process is such that nobility can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal years and  nobility s product mix was affected by the number of special edition homes marketed by prestige and by consumer demand for smaller  less expensive homes 
most family buyer s today purchase three  four or five bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement buyers who reside in the manufactured housing communities 
nobility s joint venture and finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation provides mortgage financing to retail customers who purchase nobility s manufactured homes at prestige retail sales centers 
these agreements  under which loans are originated and serviced  have given prestige more control over the financing aspect of the retail home sales process and allowed it to offer better services to its retail customers 
management believes that these agreements give prestige an additional potential for profit by providing finance products to retail customers 
in addition  management believes that prestige has more input in the design of unique finance programs for prospective homebuyers  and that the joint venture has resulted in more profitable sales at its prestige retail sales centers 
for more information about the finance revenue sharing agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with site built housing  financing packages are available to provide year financing  an interest rate reduction program  combination land manufactured home loans  and a down payment program for qualified buyers 
in december  st mortgage corporation advised the company that st mortgage corporation s parent company had decided not to provide any additional funding for loan originations at that time 
the company owns a interest in majestic  a joint venture with st mortgage corporation 
the decision by the parent company of st mortgage corporation to not provide additional capital to support the lending operation required us to consider seeking capital from alternative sources 
the company has been able to sign dealer agreements with additional lenders who provide financing for our homes 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  majestic secured  in financing from a commercial bank 
the company guarantees of this financing 
both of these additional sources of funding have been sufficient to fund our loan originations to date allowing us to fund loans without interruption 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  st mortgage corporation announced that their parent company had agreed to provide additional capital to fund loan originations  which will be available when majestic has fully lent the proceeds from the  commercial loan 
prestige also maintains several other outside financing sources that provide financing to retail homebuyers for its manufactured homes and the company is in the process of developing relationships with new lenders 
in the future  nobility may explore the possibility of underwriting its own mortgage loans for non st mortgage loans 
prestige s wholly owned subsidiary  mountain financial  inc  is an independent insurance agent  licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker 
mountain financial provides construction loans  mortgage brokerage services  automobile  extended warranty coverage and property and casualty insurance to prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes 
the company s fiscal year ends on the first saturday on or after october the year ended november  consisted of fifty three week periods and year ended october  consisted of fifty two week periods 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes certain key sales statistics and percent of gross profit as of and for fiscal years ended november  and october  homes sold through company owned sales centers homes sold to independent dealers total new factory built homes produced less intercompany average new manufactured home price retail average new manufactured home price wholesale as a percent of net sales gross profit from the company owned retail sales centers gross profit from the manufacturing facilities including intercompany sales for fiscal years ended november  and october  results are as follows 
total net sales in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year sales and operations for fiscal year  although improved  continued to be adversely impacted by our country s economic uncertainty and the low manufactured housing shipments in florida  plus the overall weakness in florida and the nation s housing market 
industry shipments in florida for the period november through october were up approximately from the same period last year 
even though nobility s sales  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses improved  the company s low sales volume made it difficult to report meaningful results for fiscal continued lack of retail and wholesale financing  very high unemployment and home foreclosures  slow sales of existing site built homes  low consumer confidence and a poor economic outlook for the us and florida s economy are just a few of the on going challenges the company faced 
while management has not seen decisive improvement in these challenges brought about by the tumultuous events of and  some slight progress has emerged for the nation s economy 
although the overall housing picture  credit market and economy have not improved measurably during the past year and the immediate outlook for the manufactured housing industry in florida and the nation is uncertain  the long term demographic trends still favor future growth in the florida market area we serve 
job formation  immigration growth and migration trends  plus consumers returning to more affordable housing should favor florida 
the baby boomer generation began to turn in january and by the number of americans and over is predicted to almost double 
this trend coupled with the end of the free spending credit driven years  nobility s years in the florida market  and consumers increased need for more affordable housing should serve the company well in the coming years 
management remains convinced that our specific geographic market is one of the best long term growth areas in the country 
for fiscal  the country must experience a better economy with less uncertainty  improved sales in the existing home market  declining unemployment  continued low interest rates  improving credit markets  increased consumer confidence and more retail financing for the demand of our affordable homes to improve significantly 
management understands that during this very complex economic environment  maintaining the company s strong financial position is vital for future growth and success 
because of the poor business conditions in our market area and the lack of any clarity as to when today s economic challenges will improve measurably  the company will continue to evaluate prestige s twelve retail model centers in florida  along with all expenses within the company and react in a manner consistent with maintaining our financial position 
the company invested as a limited partner in two new florida retirement manufactured home communities in fiscal year although these investments will report non cash losses in the initial fill up stage  management believes that the new attractive and affordable manufactured home communities for senior citizens will be a growth area for florida in the future 
nobility homes  inc has specialized for years in the design and production of quality  affordable manufactured homes at its plant located in central florida 
with twelve company retail sales centers  a finance company joint venture  an insurance subsidiary  and an investment in two new affordable retirement manufactured home communities  nobility is the only vertically integrated manufactured home company headquartered in florida 

table of contents insurance agent commissions in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year the decline in insurance agent commissions resulted from a decline in new policies written and renewals 
prestige s wholly owned subsidiary  mountain financial  inc  is an independent insurance agent  licensed mortgage lender and mortgage broker 
its principal activity is the performance of retail insurance services  which involves placing various types of insurance  including property and casualty  automobile and extended home warranty coverage  with insurance underwriters on behalf of its prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes

mountain financial  inc has no material commitments or contingencies 
the company establishes appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers  historical experience and other information  which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary 
in the opinion of management  no reserve is deemed necessary for policy cancellations at november  and october  the construction lending operations provide financing to buyers who have been approved for financing by an independent third party and who are purchasing a home through the company s retail sales centers 
such a loan provides the homeowner with enough money to pay for the land  land improvements  construction and installation of the home  impact fees and permits 
the loan is disbursed in draws as construction progresses and is secured by a first mortgage on the land  home and all of the improvements 
the term is typically for one year  with interest only payable monthly 
there is also a finance charge which is added to the loan at closing 
the construction loan is paid off when the homeowner closes on the permanent financing  typically a year fixed mortgage 
the revenues from the construction lending operations in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year mountain financial acted as the warehouse lender for a mortgage lender who was financing two of prestige retail customers in the amount of  the warehouse loan from mountain would be repaid when the mortgage lender sold the loans to a wholesale lender

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased sales at the company s manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers  although the reserve established for potential losses associated with the refurbishing and re selling of the repossessions increased  to  for fiscal year the expenses to temporarily close the belleview manufacturing facility see liquidity and capital resources and transfer the raw materials to the ocala manufacturing facility  the number of repossessions that the company has experienced over the past fiscal year related to its finance revenue sharing agreement  the  inventory valuation reserve established for potential losses associated with the refurbishing and re selling of the repossessions and the fixed overhead costs associated with the lower sales volume at the manufacturing facility and retail sales centers were the primary reason gross profit margins were lower in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses at our manufacturing facility include salaries  professional services  advertising and promotions  corporate expense  employee benefits  office equipment and supplies and utilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses at our retail sales center include advertising  retail sales centers expenses  salary and salary related  professional fees  corporate expense  employee benefit  office equipment and supplies  utilities and travel

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year in spite of closing three retail sales centers in fiscal year and the write off of certain capitalized assets  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales declined due to the fixed expenses directly related to the increased sales at the company s manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers in fiscal year the higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal year resulted from the fixed expenses directly related to the decreased sales at the company s manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers  the closing of three retail sales centers and the write off of certain capitalized assets see liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents the company earned  from its joint venture  majestic  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the earnings from majestic represent the allocation of profit and losses which are owned by st mortgage corporation and by the company 
the primary assets are loans that were originated from until in  the company entered into a finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation and all loans originated from that point forward  are owned by st mortgage corporation pursuant to the finance revenue sharing agreement as further discussed below 
consequently  no additional loans are going into the majestic joint venture and the balance of the loans assets of the partnership is declining each month due to amortization and payoffs 
in accordance with the company s finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation  the company refers its customers to st mortgage corporation for financing on manufactured homes sold through the company s retail sales centers 
under the finance revenue sharing agreement  the company has agreed to repurchase from st mortgage corporation any repossessed homes and related collateral that was financed under the agreement 
the repurchase price is the remaining loan balance plus st mortgage corporation s legal fees 
if the loan included a mortgage on the land  the company receives the land in addition to the home 
if the loan only had the home as collateral  the company only gets the home and is required to move it off the location where it was previously sited 
after the company re sells the homes  the company receives the full proceeds from the sale of the home  plus a reimbursement from st mortgage corporation for liquidation expenses 
the reimbursement covers the company s cost of transporting homes  repairing homes to resale condition  remarketing homes and other liquidation expenses 
the company and st mortgage corporation have agreed that the reimbursement for a a home only repurchase will not exceed of the company s purchase price nor will it be less than of the company s repurchase price  and b a home and land repurchase will not exceed of the company s purchase price nor will it be less than of the company s purchase price 
the company believes that the revenue sharing agreement reserve account carried on the books of st mortgage corporation which provides for the payments above more than offsets the fair value of any asc liability that might arise under the agreement 
due to the number of repurchased homes the company has experienced in fiscal year and under the finance revenue sharing agreement  the company has increased its inventory valuation reserve to  in from  in for potential losses associated with the refurbishing and reselling of the repurchased homes 
the company is repurchasing the collateral consisting of either the home or home and land for the amount of the loan receivable not including accrued interest carried by st mortgage corporation 
the positive impact upon results of operations from the re sale of the collateral for defaulted loans has been approximately  which includes commission income of  in fiscal year and  which includes commission income of  in fiscal year there were re sales during fiscal year and re sales in fiscal year the company earned  for fiscal year from the finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation  prestige home centers  inc and majestic homes  inc 
to the extent that the finance revenue sharing agreement has reserves in excess of the minimum reserve as required to be maintained  those funds are available for distribution 
the minimum reserve is determined by a formula based on the delinquency rate and the higher the delinquency rate of the loan portfolio the more that is needed in the minimum reserve 
during the fiscal year and second  third and fourth quarters of  the loan delinquencies had increased to the point that there was not enough excess reserve to warrant a distribution 
the reserve for loan losses of approximately  is held by st mortgage corporation and does not appear on the company s books 
included in the reserve is the cost of refurbishing and reselling the repurchased and foreclosed homes 
all of the earnings of the loans originated under the finance revenue sharing agreement go to the reserve account 
if this reserve account balance is greater than the minimum required reserve  a distribution can be made 
if the delinquency rate in the loan portfolio increases requiring an increase in the required minimum reserve to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the reserve amount  then no amount would be available for distribution 
pursuant to the finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation  the company s subsidiaries  prestige home centers  inc and majestic homes  inc  are not required to repay any previously received distributions 
however  should the escrow account maintained by st mortgage corporation for the loans originated pursuant to this agreement ever be less than  then prestige and majestic homes must contribute an amount equal to of such deficit and st mortgage corporation will credit an equal amount to the escrow account 
if prestige and majestic homes fail to contribute  they forfeit all rights to distributions under the finance revenue sharing agreement but will be required to continue purchasing repossessed homes under the agreement 
the company earned interest on cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments in the amount of  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the decreased interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of cash  cash equivalents and long term investments and in the lower variable rate portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances 

table of contents the company reported losses from investments in the retirement community limited partnerships in the amount of  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year although these investments will report losses in the initial fill up stage  management believes that new attractive and affordable manufactured home communities for senior citizens will be a significant growth area for florida in the future 
because of a dispute on the refinancing terms on one of the florida retirement manufactured home communities  walden woods  with the current mortgage lender  the general partner sought bankruptcy protection in august final resolution of the dispute is pending bankruptcy court approval 
the projected tax effect of tax positions arising in the current year have been reflected as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate for the interim period 
in that regard  the company has recognized  in benefits due to the statute of limitations expiring on uncertain tax positions previously recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the factors discussed above  losses in fiscal year were  or per share and in fiscal year were  or per share 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  at november  compared to  at october  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the proceeds from maturity of long term investments 
short and long term investments were  at november  compared to  at october  the decrease in short and long term investments was primarily due to the maturity of some of the bonds in the investment portfolio 
working capital was  at november  as compared to  at october  nobility owns the entire inventory for its prestige retail sales centers which includes new  pre owned and repossessed or foreclosed homes and does not incur any third party floor plan financing expenses 
accounts payable at november  was  compared to  at october  the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to a increase in materials purchased since the number of homes produced in fourth quarter of at the company s manufacturing facility increased by percent from fourth quarter of accrued compensation at november  was  compared to  at october  since accrued compensation consists largely of sales commissions and bonuses  the increase in accrued compensation was primarily due to the increase in the number of homes sold at the company s retail sales centers in fourth quarter of compared to fourth quarter of accrued expenses and other current liabilities at november  was  compared to  at october  the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the decrease in the average retail selling price 
customer deposits increased to  at november  from  at october  due to the slight increase in the number of sold retail homes on customers sites awaiting completion 
the belleview manufacturing plant was consolidated into the ocala manufacturing plant in the second quarter of  because of the poor economic conditions in florida and the rest of the united states and no immediate improvement of either in sight 
the company was not selling enough manufactured homes to justify keeping both plants open 
the company was able to transfer the raw material inventory to the ocala plant and use it in producing the belleview plant s models in our ocala plant 
most members of the belleview plant s management team and several of the employees were integrated into the ocala plant 
the cost to close the belleview plant was approximately  and the ongoing cost for insurance  taxes  and minimum utilities is approximately  per quarter 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company has leased the belleview plant for a two year period beginning in february if business conditions improve to the point that the ocala plant production is at or near capacity  the company would reopen the belleview plant 
there were three retail model centers closed in fiscal year located in tallahassee  lake city and jacksonville  florida and two closed in fiscal year located in ft walton and ocala  florida 
the inventory was transported to other retail model centers with the close down costing approximately  per model center and no on going cost associated with the locations closed

walton model center in the ocala model center had  in land improvements written off in fiscal year dividends are determined annually by the board of directors and are based on the profitability of the company 
management did not recommend to the board that a dividend be paid based on the results in fiscal years and on january  nobility paid an annual cash dividend of per common share or an aggregate of  for fiscal year 
table of contents nobility did not repurchase any of its common stock in the open market during fiscal year the company repurchased in the open market  shares of its common stock for  during fiscal year the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s stock in the open market 
nobility maintained a revolving credit agreement with a major bank providing for borrowing up to  at october  there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement 
the company has experienced no credit rating downgrades which would have an impact on our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement 
the million unsecured revolving credit agreement expired on may  we do not plan to incur any expenditure in fiscal year for the purchase of any of our current retail sales centers since we have no plan to purchase any of our leased centers in fiscal year the expenditures associated with defaulted loans are highly related to the unemployment rate in our market area and the length and severity of the recession  in addition to how quickly the company can resell the foreclosed homes 
our joint venture still has a significant loan loss reserve of over million on the portfolio of million in loans 
based on the current level of sales  construction loans should not exceed  the company could be required to repurchase several million dollars more of defaulted loans during the remainder of fiscal year depending upon delinquency and foreclosure rates 
the company has repurchased approximately  in additional defaulted loans under the finance revenue sharing agreement since november  under the finance revenue sharing agreement  loans that are days past due are considered to be delinquent 
at november    or  of the loans in the portfolio subject to the finance revenue sharing agreement were delinquent 
at november   there were loan loss reserves of of the finance revenue sharing agreement s loan portfolio  which  based on our historical recovery ratios  should be sufficient to cover our losses on the disposition of delinquent loans 
the joint venture  majestic  is monitoring loan loss reserves on a monthly basis and is adjusting the loan loss reserves as necessary 
if the fair market value of the collateral is less than the purchase price  after combining the liquidation expense reserves carried by st mortgage corporation  the company would book a loss at that time 
the risk of loss is carried primarily by st mortgage corporation as evidenced by the loss reimbursement payment of up to that prestige can use to cover any shortfall in the sales proceeds from the cost of repurchasing the home 
the maximum future undiscounted payments the company could be required to make under the finance revenue sharing agreement  as of november   is  in repurchase obligations  offset by payments from st mortgage corporation for the loss reserve reconciliation of up to  and the proceeds from the sale of the homes the collateral 
the company owns a interest in majestic  a joint venture with st mortgage corporation 
the company has dealer agreements with a number of lenders who provide financing for our homes 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  majestic secured  in financing from a commercial bank 
the company guarantees of this financing 
in addition  subsequent to fiscal year end  st mortgage corporation announced that their parent company had agreed to provide additional capital to fund loan originations  which will be available when majestic fully lent the proceeds from the  commercial loan 
both of these sources of funding have been sufficient to fund our loan originations to date 
to date  we have been able to fund loans without interruption 
despite lower sales  negative cash flows  net operating losses and the repurchase of homes under the finance revenue sharing agreement  we are able to continue operations through fiscal year we will continue to monitor and eliminate all unnecessary expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company applies judgment and estimates  which may have a material effect in the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  accounts receivable  inventory and goodwill

the company recognizes revenues from its wholly owned subsidiary  mountain financial  inc  as follows commission income and fees in lieu of commissions is recorded as of the effective date of insurance coverage or the billing date  whichever is later 
commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies are recorded as revenue when received which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned due to the lack of policy and renewal information 
contingent commissions are recorded as revenue when received 
contingent commissions are commissions paid by insurance underwriters and are based on the estimated profit and or overall volume of business placed with the underwriter 
the data necessary for the calculation of contingent commissions cannot be reasonably obtained prior to the receipt of the commission which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned
