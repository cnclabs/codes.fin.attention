item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains or incorporates by reference certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and  as such  may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
forward looking statements are those that predict or describe future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters 
you can generally identify forward looking statements as statements containing the words will  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume or other similar expressions 
you should not rely on our forward looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to assumptions  known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other unpredictable factors  many of which are beyond our control 
therefore  our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  some of which are listed under the section risk factors  item a of this annual report on form k 
statements regarding the following subjects  among others  may be forward looking changes in interest rates and the market value of our mbs  changes in the yield curve  the availability of mortgage backed securities for purchase  changes in the prepayment rates on the mortgage loans securing our mbs  our ability to borrow to finance our assets  our ability to use borrowings to finance our assets and  if available  the terms of any financing  implementation of or changes in government regulations or programs affecting our business  our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  our ability to maintain our exemption from registration under the investment company act of  as amended  risks associated with investing in real estate assets  including changes in business conditions and the general economy  and management s ability to manage our growth 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
new risks and uncertainties arise over time and it is not possible to predict those events or how they may affect us 
except as required by law  we do not intend to  update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
general we were formed in october and commenced operations on march  we are in the business of investing primarily in united states agency mortgage backed securities  or mbs  which are obligations guaranteed by the united states government  such as ginnie mae  or federally sponsored enterprises such as fannie mae or freddie mac 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage related assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of these assets 
we are organized for tax purposes as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
accordingly  we generally distribute substantially all of our taxable earnings to stockholders without paying federal or state income tax at the corporate level on the distributed earnings 
at december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  or code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualified for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
at december   we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our taxable net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the code 
although the us government and other governments have taken various actions including placing fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship intended to protect financial institutions  their respective economies and their respective housing and mortgage markets  we continue to operate under very difficult market conditions 
there can be no assurance that these various actions will have a beneficial impact on the global financial markets and  more specifically  the market for the securities we currently own in our portfolio 
we 
table of contents cannot predict what  if any  impact these actions or future actions by either the us government or foreign governments could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these events may impact the availability of financing generally in the marketplace and also may impact the market value of mbs generally  including the securities we currently own in our portfolio 
in july  the dodd frank financial reform bill was passed by congress and signed into law by president obama 
this legislation aims to restore responsibility and accountability to the us financial system 
it is unclear how this legislation may impact the financial environment  particularly for agency mbs  repurchase agreements and interest rate swap agreements  as much of the bill s implementation has not yet been defined by the regulators 
our continuing operations consist of the following portfolios agency mortgage backed securities  or agency mbs  and non agency mortgage backed securities  or non agency mbs 
approximately of our total portfolio is agency mbs 
at december   we had total assets of billion 
our agency mbs portfolio  consisting of billion  was distributed as follows adjustable rate agency mbs  hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs  year fixed rate agency mbs  year fixed rate agency mbs and less than agency floating rate cmos 
our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of approximately million of floating rate cmos 
stockholders equity available to common stockholders at december  was approximately million  or per share 
the million equals total stockholders equity of million less the series a preferred stock liquidating value of approximately million and less the difference between the series b preferred stock liquidating value of million and the proceeds from its from its sale of million 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million 
net income to common stockholders was million  or net income of per diluted share  based on a weighted average of million fully diluted shares outstanding  which consisted of net income of million minus payment of preferred dividends of million 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   our net income was million 
our net income available to common stockholders was million  or per diluted share  based on a weighted average of million fully diluted shares outstanding 
this includes net income of million minus the payment of preferred dividends of million 
for the year ended december   our net income was million 
our net income available to common stockholders was million  or per diluted share  based on a weighted average of million fully diluted shares outstanding 
this includes net income of million minus the payment of preferred dividends of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  or of gross income  compared to million  or of gross income  for the year ended december  net interest income is comprised of the interest income earned on mortgage investments net of premium amortization expense less interest expense from borrowings 
interest income net of premium amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  due primarily to an increase in premium amortization expense  a decrease in the weighted average coupons on agency mbs from in to in  partially offset by an increase in the weighted average portfolio outstanding of approximately billion in from approximately billion in interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  which resulted from a decline in weighted average short term interest rates  after giving effect to the swap agreements  of in vs 
in  partially offset by an increase in the average borrowings outstanding of billion in vs 
billion in 
table of contents the results of our operations are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our mbs  the supply of  and demand for  mbs in the marketplace  and the terms and availability of financing 
our net interest income varies primarily as a result from changes in interest rates  the slope of the yield curve the differential between long term and short term interest rates  borrowing costs our interest expense and prepayment speeds on our mbs portfolios  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the constant prepayment rate  vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
with respect to our business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may  over time  cause i the interest expense associated with our borrowings  which are primarily comprised of repurchase agreements  to increase  ii the value of our mbs portfolios and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to decline  iii coupons on our mbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates  iv prepayments on our mbs portfolios to slow  thereby slowing the amortization of our mbs purchase premiums  and v the value of our interest rate swap agreements and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to increase 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may  over time  cause i prepayments on our mbs portfolios to increase  thereby accelerating the amortization of our mbs purchase premiums  ii the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease  iii the value of our mbs portfolios and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to increase  iv the vale of our interest rate swap agreements and  correspondingly  our stockholders equity to decrease  and v coupons on our mbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates 
in addition  our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral pledged and general conditions in the credit markets 
during the year ended december   premium amortization expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million  due primarily to an increase in prepayments from the fannie mae and freddie mac buyouts during the year and an increase in the amortization of unearned premium on securities acquired in at higher premiums 
the table below shows the approximate constant prepayment rate of our agency mbs and non agency mbs year ended december  year ended december  portfolio first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter agency mbs and non agency mbs during the year ended december   there was no gain or loss recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness  compared to a net gain of approximately thousand recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended december  we have determined that our hedges are still considered highly effective 
there were no components of the derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
total expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in total expenses was due primarily to a decrease in compensation costs of million due primarily to decreased incentive compensation  a decrease of thousand in the amount written off on the lehman brothers  inc receivable and a decrease in other expenses as detailed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements of thousand 
years ended december  and for the year ended december   our net income was million

net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million or of gross income  compared to million  or of gross income  for the year ended december  net interest income is comprised of the interest income earned on mortgage investments net of premium amortization expense less interest expense from borrowings 
interest income net of premium amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of due primarily to a decrease in average coupons and an increase in premium amortization expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  which resulted from a decline in short term interest rates 
during the year ended december   premium amortization expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million 
the table below shows the approximate constant prepayment rate of our agency mbs and non agency mbs year ended december  year ended december  portfolio first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter agency mbs and non agency mbs during the year ended december   we did not sell any agency mbs 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of agency mbs relating to the close out of our repurchase agreement borrowings with lehman brothers special finance  resulting in a loss of approximately thousand 
these sales were in connection with the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc and we do not anticipate any other sales in connection with bankruptcies unless one of our other counterparties defaults 
during the year ended december   we did not recognize through earnings any impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we had recognized through earnings impairment charges of approximately million on our non agency mbs portfolio  with approximately million being recognized during the third quarter ended september  and approximately million being recognized during the fourth quarter ended december  of these amounts  approximately million had previously been shown as unrealized loss in other comprehensive income loss of stockholders equity at june  as we believed this decline in fair value was likely to be other than temporary  we recognized an impairment charge to write these securities down to their estimated fair value 
some of the factors considered in our assessment included the expected cash flows from these investments  whether there has been an other than temporary deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying mortgages  the credit protection available to the related mortgage pools  any other market information available  management s internal analysis of the securities considering all relevant information at the time of the assessment  and the magnitude and duration of the historical decline in market prices 
because our assessment is based on both factual and subjective information available at the time of the assessment  the determination of the amount considered impaired is subjective and therefore constitutes material estimates that are susceptible to significant change 
during the year ended december   there was a net gain of approximately thousand recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness  compared to a net loss of approximately thousand due to hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended december  we have determined that our hedges are still considered highly effective 
there were no components of the derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 

table of contents in september  the assets of belvedere trust and the assets of bt management company  llc  or bt management  were assigned for the benefit of their creditors to an independent third party 
as control of these operations was turned over to this third party  belvedere trust and bt management were deconsolidated  and we recognized a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations of approximately million during the year ended december  as a result  there were no remaining assets or liabilities of discontinued operations at december  total expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million in total expenses was due primarily to an increase in compensation costs of million due to increased bonuses and incentive compensation  the write down of a receivable from lehman brothers  inc of approximately thousand and partially offset by a decrease in other expenses as detailed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements of thousand and the write off in of common stock offering costs of thousand 
financial condition agency mbs portfolio at december   we held agency mortgage assets whose amortized cost was approximately billion  consisting primarily of billion of adjustable rate agency mbs  billion of fixed rate agency mbs and million of floating rate cmos 
this amount represents an approximate increase from the billion held at december  of the adjustable rate agency mbs owned by us  were adjustable rate pass through certificates whose coupons reset within one year 
the remaining consisted of hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs whose coupons will reset between one year and five years 
hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs have an initial interest rate that is fixed for a certain period  usually three to five years  and thereafter adjust annually for the remainder of the term of the loan 
the following table presents a schedule of our agency mbs at fair value owned at december  and december   classified by type of issuer dollar amounts in thousands december  december  agency fair value portfolio percentage fair value portfolio percentage fannie mae fnm freddie mac fhlmc ginnie mae gnma total agency mbs the following table classifies our portfolio of agency mbs owned at december  and december  by type of interest rate index dollar amounts in thousands december  december  agency fair value portfolio percentage fair value portfolio percentage one month libor six month libor one year libor six month certificate of deposit six month constant maturity treasury one year constant maturity treasury cost of funds index year fixed rate year fixed rate total agency mbs 
table of contents the fair values indicated do not include interest earned but not yet paid 
with respect to our hybrid adjustable rate agency mbs  the fair value of these securities appears on the line associated with the index based on which the security will eventually reset once the initial fixed interest rate period has expired 
the fair value of our agency mbs is reported to us independently from dealers who are major financial institutions and are considered to be market makers for these types of instruments 
for more detail on the fair value of our agency mbs  see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average coupon and average amortized costs of our agency mbs at december  and december  were as follows december  december  weighted average coupon adjustable rate hybrid adjustable rate year fixed rate year fixed rate cmos total agency mbs average amortized cost adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate year fixed rate year fixed rate total agency mbs current yield weighted average coupon divided by average amortized cost relative to our agency mbs portfolio at december   the average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements was and the average days to maturity was days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
relative to our agency mbs portfolio at december   the average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements was and the average days to maturity was days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the average interest rate on outstanding repurchase agreements was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december  and december   the unamortized net premium paid for our agency mbs was approximately million and million  respectively 
one of the factors that impacts the reported yield on our mbs portfolio is the actual prepayment rate on the underlying mortgages 
we analyze our mbs and the extent to which prepayments impact the yield 
when the rate of prepayments exceeds expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed cpr  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
non agency mbs portfolio non agency mbs are securities issued by companies that are not government or government sponsored enterprises and are secured primarily by first lien residential mortgage loans 
at december   our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of a fair value of million of floating rate cmos with an average coupon of  which were acquired at par value 
at december   our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of a fair value of million of floating rate cmos with an average coupon of  which were acquired at par value 

table of contents at december   the fair value of our non agency mbs portfolio decreased to approximately million from a fair value of approximately million at december  the decrease was due primarily to principal paydowns of approximately million offset by an increase in an unrealized gain of approximately million 
at december   the amortized cost of our non agency mbs was thousand 
at december   the amortized cost of our non agency mbs was million 
at december   the two securities representing the principal balance of our non agency mbs portfolio were rated cc by standard poor s and c by moody s investor service 
we received valuations at december  and december  for the non agency mbs from an independent third party pricing service whose methodologies are based on broker provided pricing as well as indirect observation of market activity and we consider the fair value measurement a level input at december  and december  for more detail on the fair value of our non agency mbs  see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements

table of contents hedging we periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of interest rate swaps  which are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investments in securities 
we designate interest rate swap transactions as cash flow hedges 
to the extent that we enter into hedging transactions to reduce our interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any income or gain from the disposition of hedging transactions should be qualifying income under the reit rules for purposes of the gross income test 
the hedging rules that exclude certain hedging income from the computation of the income test have been extended to exclusion under the income test as well 
to qualify for this exclusion  the hedging transaction must be clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired  originated or entered into 
the transaction must hedge indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by us to acquire or carry real estate assets 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements are entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and are designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
at december   we were a counter party to swap agreements  which are derivative instruments as defined by the financial accounting standards board in accounting standards classification  or asc  no 
 with an aggregate notional amount of billion and an average maturity of years 
we utilize swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and do not anticipate entering into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
in accordance with the swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest during the term of the swap agreements and receive a payment that varies with the three month libor rate 
at december   there were unrealized losses of approximately million on our swap agreements 
for more information on the amounts  policies  objectives and other qualitative data on our hedge agreements  see notes  and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources agency mbs and non agency mbs portfolios our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements which totaled billion at december  as collateral for these repurchase agreements  we have pledged approximately billion in agency mbs 
our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal from our agency mbs portfolio in the amount of billion 
for the year ended december   there was a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
this consisted of the following components net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this is comprised primarily of net income of million  adding back the following non cash items the amortization of premium and discounts of approximately million  the write down on the lehman receivable of approximately thousand  the amortization of restricted stock of thousand and non cash incentive compensation of approximately thousand 
net cash provided by operating activities also included an increase in accrued expenses and payable for securities purchased of approximately million and a decrease in interest receivable of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of approximately million  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately billion  which consisted of purchases of agency mbs of approximately billion  partially offset by billion from principal payments on agency mbs  and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this consisted of borrowings on repurchase agreements of approximately billion  partially offset by repayments on repurchase agreements of approximately billion  net 
table of contents proceeds from common stock issued of approximately million less dividends paid of million on common stock and dividends paid of approximately million on preferred stock 
relative to our agency mbs portfolio at december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from days to three months 
at december   we had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with different financial institutions 
as the repurchase agreements mature  we enter into new repurchase agreements to take their place 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mbs and because increases in short term interest rates or increasing market concern about the liquidity or value of our mbs can negatively impact the valuation of mbs  our borrowing ability could be reduced and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mbs declines for other reasons 
we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the year ended december  but there can be no assurance we will have adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements in the future 
our leverage on capital including all preferred stock and junior subordinated notes increased from x at december  to x at december  in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will continue to consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mbs portfolios 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mbs  cash and cash equivalents 
a large negative change in the market value of our mbs might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
during the year ended december   we raised approximately million in capital under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
at december   our authorized capital included million shares of par value preferred stock  which we have classified as series a cumulative preferred stock  or series a preferred stock  and series b cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we did not issue any shares of series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we did not sell any shares of common stock under our controlled equity offering sales agreement  or the program  with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor as described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we did not sell any shares of series a preferred stock or series b preferred stock under the program 
at december   there were  shares of common stock   shares of series a preferred stock and  shares of series b preferred stock  respectively  available under the program 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program  permitting us to acquire  shares of our common stock  or approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
the shares are to be acquired at prevailing prices through open market transactions 
from february  through december   we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of per share under the share repurchase program as more fully described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the shares were acquired at prevailing prices through open market transactions and were made subject to restrictions related to volume  pricing and timing subject to applicable sec rules 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years repurchase agreements junior subordinated notes lease commitment total these represent amounts due by maturity 
these represent amounts due by contractual maturity 
however  we do have the option to redeem these after march  and april  as more fully described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
this does not include annual compensation agreements and incentive compensation agreements  which are more fully described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our agency mbs and non agency mbs  which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost 
based upon these treatments  our total equity base at december  was million 
common stockholders equity was approximately million  or a book value of per share 
under our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets are assessed to determine whether they are other than temporary 
to the extent we determine that these unrealized fluctuations are not other than temporary  they do not impact gaap income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the assets and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting on all of our assets 
as a result  comparisons with some companies that use historical cost accounting for all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
unrealized changes in the fair value of mbs have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity  while negative changes will tend to reduce borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mbs might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain on available for sale agency mbs was approximately million  or of the amortized cost of our agency mbs  at december  this  along with accumulated other comprehensive loss  derivatives of approximately million and accumulated other comprehensive gain  non agency mbs of million  constitutes the total accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million 
critical accounting policies management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
management has reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying audited consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
in preparing these audited consolidated financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments on the basis of information then readily available to it of certain amounts included in the audited consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially and adversely from these estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of our accounting policies are the following revenue recognition the most significant source of our revenue is derived from our investments in mbs 
we reflect income using the effective yield method which  through amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts at an effective yield  recognizes periodic income over the estimated life of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes our revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
interest income on our mbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal amounts of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the expected lives of the securities using the effective interest yield method  adjusted for the effects of actual prepayments and estimated prepayments based on asc our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
valuation and classification of investment securities we carry our investment securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our agency mbs are generally based on third party bid price indications provided by certain dealers who make markets in such securities 
the fair value of our non agency mbs are obtained from an independent third party pricing service whose methodologies are based on broker provided pricing as well as indirect observation of market activity 
if  in the opinion of management  one or more securities prices reported to us are not reliable or unavailable  management reviews the fair value based on characteristics of the security it receives from the issuer and available market information 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
we review various factors ie  expected cash flows  changes in interest rates  credit protection  etc 
in determining whether and to what extent an other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that unrealized losses on our agency mbs and non agency mbs are attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we do not have the intent to sell these investments nor is it not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be at maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired 
losses that are related to credit quality on securities classified as available for sale  which are determined by management to be other than temporary in nature  are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to current period income loss 
for more detail on the fair value of our securities  see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with asc  a derivative that is designated as a hedge is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
in order for our interest rate swap agreements to qualify for hedge accounting  upon entering into the swap agreement  we must anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective  as defined by asc on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 

table of contents changes in the fair value of a derivative that are highly effective and that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to income when the forecasted transaction affects income eg  when periodic settlement interest payments are due on repurchase agreements 
the swap agreements are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value based on values obtained from large financial institutions  who are market makers for these types of instruments 
hedge ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in current period income 
we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
when we discontinue hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into income when the forecasted transaction affects income 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period income 
for purposes of the cash flow statement  cash flows from derivative instruments are classified with the cash flows from the hedged item 
for more detail on our derivative instruments  see notes  and to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our financial results do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  management does not expect to pay substantial  if any  corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements  the date adoption is required and the impact on our consolidated financial statements is contained in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events we have evaluated subsequent events through february   which is the date that our consolidated financial statements are issued 
for purposes of these financial statements  we have not evaluated any subsequent events after this date 
on january   we declared a series a preferred stock dividend of per share and a series b preferred stock dividend of per share  each of which is payable on april  to our holders of record of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock  respectively  as of the close of business on march  on february   we entered into amendment no 
to the sales agreement with cantor 
from february  through february   we sold thousand shares of our common stock under the program  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately million  net of sales commissions less reimbursement of fees 
the sales agent received an aggregate of approximately thousand  which represents an average commission of approximately on the gross sales price per share 
during this period  we also sold approximately thousand shares of our series b preferred stock under the program  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately thousand  net of sales commissions less reimbursement of fees 
the sales agent received an aggregate of approximately thousand  which represents an average commission of approximately on the gross sales price per share 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial instruments in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage related assets 
hybrid mortgages are arms that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years or greater and then convert to an adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
arm related assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an arm related asset s interest rate can change during any given period 
arm securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage related assets that are not fully indexed 
further  some arm related assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our arm related assets with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net interest income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and the one year libor rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in the same direction  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our arm related assets and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies

we assume that if the repricing of the investment is just beyond months but less than months  it is included in the less than months category 
at december   our agency mbs and non agency mbs and related borrowings will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames dollar amounts in thousands investments borrowings amount percentage of total investments amount percentage of total borrowings investment type rate reset dates year fixed rate investments year fixed rate investments adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total based on when they contractually reprice and do not consider the effect of any prepayments 
we assume that if the repricing of the investment is just beyond months but less than months  it is included in the less than months category 
market value risk all of our mbs are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the periodic adjustment to fair value that is not considered to be an other than temporary impairment reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 

table of contents liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mbs with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mbs 
for example  at december   our agency mbs and non agency adjustable rate mbs had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mbs 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality liquid assets 
as a result  we have been able to roll over our short term borrowings as they mature 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
during the year ended december   there were continuing liquidity and credit concerns surrounding the mortgage markets generally and continuing concerns about the general economy 
while the us government and other governments have taken various actions to address these concerns  there continue to be severe restrictions on the availability of financing in general and concerns about the potential impact on product availability  liquidity  interest rates and changes in the yield curve 
while we have been able to meet all of our liquidity needs to date  there are still concerns in the mortgage sector about the availability of financing generally 
at december   we had unrestricted cash of million and million in unpledged agency mbs which does not include million in mbs acquired for future settlement and non agency mbs available to meet margin calls on short term borrowings that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender collateralization requirements 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities and mortgage loans vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of arm loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not entirely predictable 
prepayment rates may also be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate loans and arm loans underlying mbs 
the purchase prices of mbs are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mbs 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mbs purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
in addition  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mbs to replace the prepaid mbs  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage related assets that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mbs 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying mbs were prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 

table of contents general many assumptions are made to present the information in the tables below and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur  or that other events will not occur  that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the tables below and all related disclosures constitute forward looking statements 
the analyses presented utilize assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the interest rate risk profile for us 
the tables quantify the potential changes in net income and net asset value should interest rates immediately change are shocked 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mortgage related assets for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing interest rates 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net interest income and projected portfolio value as more fully discussed below  based on investments in place at december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
changes in projected net interest income equals the change that would occur in the calculated projected net interest income for the next twelve months relative to the change scenario if interest rates were to instantaneously parallel shift to and remain at the stated level for the next twelve months 
changes in projected portfolio value equals the change in value of our assets that we carry at fair value and any change in the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets and fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we generally plan to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes in interest rates on prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of our agency mbs and non agency portfolios 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
the above table includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was billion and the weighted average maturity was years 

table of contents the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net income and projected portfolio value compared to the base case used in the table above and excludes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements
