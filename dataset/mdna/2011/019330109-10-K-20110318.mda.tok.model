item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview allied motion sole focus is in the motion control industry and has developed a long term corporate strategy  with a defined driving force of electro magnetic  mechanical and electronic motion technology know how to ensure it meets the goals and objectives of the company 
through its sales force and its technology units  allied motion designs  manufactures and sells motion products to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world 
the company commitment to its own lean manufacturing tool kit  known as allied systematic tools  or ast for short  drives continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost  growth and innovation throughout the company 
outlook despite the challenges the company faced in as a result of the economic downturn  the company returned to profitability in the second half of and continued to improve profitability in conditions have continued to improve and management continues its efforts to foster additional growth in revenues and profitability 
bookings were over million  which is about million higher than bookings 
backlog at december  was million  reflecting an increase over the backlog at the end of approximately million of the backlog is due to the acquired backlog from stergrens 
the increased backlog levels reflect the economic recovery experienced during the last months in the company served markets and we believe that the increase provides a good indication that these markets are recognizing the value of the company motion solutions 
as announced in the fourth quarter of  the company relocated its copi encoder business from chatsworth  california to the emoteq facilities in tulsa  oklahoma 
the company believes that the combined entity  supporting both the motor and encoder technologies in a cohesive systems approach within the same facility  will provide the best opportunity for long term sustainable growth in sales and profitability in the future 
on june   the company acquired the shares of agile systems inc agile designs and develops advanced motion control technology including integrated power electronics  digital controls and network communications for motor control and power conversion 
agile  based in waterloo  ontario  canada  has established customers in a wide range of industries 
agile is now known as allied motion canada 
on december   the company acquired the shares of stergrens elmotor ab 
stergrens has expertise in designing drive electronics  software and mechanical processes 
the products are manufactured at stergrens facilities in sweden and china 
stergrens current products integrate their electronics expertise with other motion control products such as motors and gears 
their products are sold to oem customers throughout europe and are used in a wide variety of industrial  commercial and medical applications  including emerging green technology alternative energy and electric vehicle applications  leading edge medical instrumentation and test equipment applications and other industrial and commercial applications in which stergrens products improve the efficiency performance of the oem products 
in addition  stergrens china facility further facilitates low cost region sourcing capabilities and provides the company with a base to expand operations in the asian market 

table of contents the acquisitions made in were made primarily with cash on hand  and management believes these acquisitions will expand the company customer base  increase the various markets into which we sell  augment the company engineering knowledge  and provide all of our customers more integrated motion system solutions 
the company has a strong balance sheet and has improved liquidity when compared with the previous year 
the company made two acquisitions in  using approximately million  and the company cash position  net of outstanding debt  decreased by approximately million during 
excluding cash used for acquisitions  the company cash position  net of outstanding debt  increased by million 
operating cash flows for were up million over the company continues its position of maintaining resources in electro magnetic  mechanical and electronic design capabilities as its primary goal is to provide products that raise the bar with customers and provide important differentiating solutions against competition 
management will continue to make investments in the markets believed to provide the most opportunity for continued growth and profitability of the company 
one of the company major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
currently  the company is producing some of its motor sub assemblies and finished products at sub contract manufacturing facilities in china and slovakia 
with the acquisition of stergrens  the company now owns a manufacturing facility in china as well 
the company has increased efforts to identify opportunities where production in low cost regions can improve profitability while delivering the same high quality products 
the company products contain certain metals  and at certain times the company experiences significant fluctuations in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are all key materials in our products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing materials at lower costs from asian markets and by passing on surcharges and price increases to our customers 
the company continues to pursue aggressive motor and drive development plans for new products that leverage the combined technology base of the allied motion companies 
the company focuses on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher level  value added performance solutions and that meet the needs of its served markets 
over the last few years  the company announced several new motor designs targeted at various markets 
it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
the company continues its focus on a one team sales force to more effectively leverage resources utilizing a company wide sales organization 
with the one team sales force selling all the company products  management expectation is that this capability provides opportunities to increase sales from existing customers and secure new business opportunities 
management believes the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability

non gaap measures ebitda and ebitda before nonrecurring items are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes ebitda is often a useful measure of a company operating performance and is a significant basis used by the company management to measure the operating performance of the company business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings  as well as our provision for income tax expense 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the company industry 
the company also believes that ebitda before nonrecurring items provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business 
non recurring items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company 
they are presented separately because they are important for evaluating the underlying sustainable performance of the company 
the company considers these items to be of significance in nature and or size  and accordingly  has excluded these items from ebitda before nonrecurring items 
ebitda before nonrecurring items excludes net transaction costs of  inefficiencies from the relocation of the encoder operation of  net insurance recoveries of  and  for and  respectively

the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees
