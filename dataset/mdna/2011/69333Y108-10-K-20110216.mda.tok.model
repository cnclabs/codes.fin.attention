a summary of our financial results and our fiscal outlook are also presented 
restaurants we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the asian niche pf chang s china bistro bistro and pei wei asian diner pei wei 
bistro as of january   we owned and operated full service bistro restaurants that feature a blend of high quality  chinese inspired cuisine and attentive service in a high energy contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original bistro restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we own and operate all of our restaurants in the continental us pei wei as of january   we owned and operated quick casual pei wei restaurants that serve freshly prepared  wok seared  contemporary pan asian cuisine in a relaxed  warm environment with friendly  attentive counter service and take out flexibility 
we opened our first pei wei restaurant in july in the phoenix  arizona area 

table of contents global brand development under global brand development we have extended our brand to international markets and retail products  with both businesses operating under licensing agreements 
international and other venues we are selectively pursuing expansion of our brands into various international markets and other venues 
during fiscal and  we signed four development and licensing agreements with partners who will develop and operate bistro restaurants in international markets 
our license agreements typically provide for us to receive an initial territory fee  store opening fees and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of international restaurant sales 
as of january   seven bistro restaurants were open in mexico and the middle east 
we continue to engage in discussions with additional potential partners regarding expansion of our brands 
additionally  there are two bistro restaurants located in hawaii which are operated under a joint venture arrangement in which we own a noncontrolling interest 
retail during  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with unilever to develop and launch a premium line of frozen asian style entr es in the us under the us chang s brand 
we receive ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of product sales  with such percentages escalating over the first three years of the agreement 
during the second quarter of  the new product line became available in numerous retail outlets  at which time we began recognizing retail royalty revenues 
other ventures during  we entered into an agreement with frc balance llc  d b a true food kitchen  to provide debt capital for the early stage development of true food kitchen restaurants 
the agreement provides a million loan facility to develop true food kitchen restaurants that we can  under certain conditions  convert into a majority equity position in true food kitchen 
as of january   we had advanced million under the loan facility to fund construction of two new restaurants which opened during fiscal and to fund the initial stages of construction for one restaurant scheduled to open during fiscal our strategy our objectives are to be the best operator of asian restaurants and to expand the presence of our brand in domestic and international markets  other venues and the retail sector while providing superior returns to our investors 
we offer high quality asian cuisine in a memorable atmosphere while delivering exceptional customer service and an excellent dining value 
by developing and operating restaurants that offer guests their preferred dining experience from quick take out to a sophisticated dining occasion  we strive to create a loyal customer base that generates a high level of repeat business in our restaurants and translates to interest and trial of our retail products 
we are selective when choosing our new restaurant locations and assess anticipated returns on invested capital at both an individual restaurant and market level when determining future development plans 
we seek an average unit level return on invested capital of percent 
we plan to continue opening new restaurants for both our concepts to the extent we achieve our target rate of return 
although we are currently operating restaurants exclusively in the asian niche due to the continued popularity of asian cuisine and a relatively lower level of organized competition in this segment  we would consider additional expansion opportunities to the extent such ventures can meet or exceed our return thresholds 
we have also partnered with experienced operators in international markets through development and licensing agreements to expand our brands worldwide 
additionally  a premium line of frozen asian style entr es developed under a licensing agreement became available during fiscal  which provides another opportunity for consumers to enjoy the high quality  intensely flavored cuisine that our guests enjoy in our restaurants 

table of contents our challenges our business is highly sensitive to changes in guest traffic 
increases in guest traffic typically drive higher sales  which improve the leverage of our fixed operating costs and thus enable us to achieve higher operating margins 
as guest traffic decreases  lower sales may result in decreased leverage that can lead to deteriorations in our operating margins 
in order to position our brands for success during economic downturns and recoveries  our operators concentrate on consistent execution of superior customer service while also focusing on additional opportunities for operating efficiencies 
the restaurant industry is significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  consumer tastes  lifestyle trends and cost fluctuations 
in recent years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers dine out less frequently than in the past or have reduced the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
accordingly  we strive to evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to help maintain and enhance the strength of our brands and remain fresh and relevant to our guests while maintaining a high value to price perception 
we continuously update our menu offerings and have injected our restaurants with an updated contemporary look and feel 
we also employ marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
the restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price value relationships  ambiance  service and location  and many existing restaurants compete with us at each of our locations 
additionally  the ongoing popularity of asian cuisine may result in increased competition from new asian branded concepts as well as non asian restaurants and other food outlets that may expand their asian inspired menu offerings 
we also face growing competition as retail outlets improve the quality and convenience of their meal offerings potentially resulting in fewer occasions for consumers to dine out 
our business is also influenced by the level of corporate travel and entertainment spending by businesses as a significant portion of our sales is generated by guests conducting business at our restaurants 
there was a considerable reduction in business travel  and corporate spending in general  throughout fiscal and through the first half of fiscal although our large ticket transactions improved sequentially in the second half of the year  our fiscal revenues were negatively impacted by a decline in corporate spending and large party transactions 
our financial results consolidated revenue growth of percent to billion  primarily due to sales from new restaurant openings  an increase in the average ticket at pei wei restaurants and an increase in guest traffic at both bistro and pei wei restaurants  partially offset by the impact of one fewer operating week in fiscal  a percent decline in consolidated operating margins resulting from a decline at the bistro due to labor inefficiencies from the happy hour menu roll out partially offset by a slight increase at pei wei primarily due to labor efficiencies  a percent increase in income from continuing operations  net of tax  to million primarily due to lower preopening expense  lower cost of sales and the net benefit of discrete items in income tax expense  a percent increase in diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to pfcb to due to a percent increase in income from continuing operations  net of tax  combined with the benefit of lower diluted shares outstanding  principally resulting from share repurchases  and four new bistro openings and two new pei wei openings 
our outlook we anticipate fiscal consolidated revenue growth of approximately three to four percent compared to fiscal this increase is comprised of higher expected sales during fiscal at restaurants that have been open longer than months combined with revenues from nine to thirteen anticipated new restaurant openings during fiscal and the benefit of a full year of revenues for restaurants that opened during fiscal 
table of contents we expect to experience higher commodity costs and increased labor wage rates during fiscal which will be partially offset with a slight menu price increase at both concepts 
despite these cost pressures  we anticipate that fiscal restaurant operating margins will increase compared to fiscal  primarily due to lapping the impact of the first quarter of bistro happy hour rollout combined with a higher contribution from global brand development businesses 
in addition  we expect an increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal  primarily related to higher share based compensation expense 
we expect to open three to five new bistro restaurants and six to eight new pei wei restaurants during fiscal additionally  we expect to reduce diluted shares outstanding as a result of additional repurchases of our common shares of approximately million during fiscal overall  the company expects consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from to for fiscal  an increase of approximately development bistro we intend to open three to five new bistro restaurants in our bistro restaurants typically range in size from  to  square feet and require an average total invested capital of approximately million to million per restaurant net of estimated tenant incentives 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  to  per restaurant during fiscal pei wei we intend to open six to eight new pei wei restaurants 
our pei wei restaurants typically range in size from  to  square feet and require an average total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated tenant incentives 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  to  per restaurant during fiscal global brand development during fiscal  our partners collectively intend to open seven to ten new bistro restaurants in international markets 
these new restaurant openings will require no capital investment from us 
operating statistics there are several key financial metrics that can be useful in evaluating and understanding our business 
these metrics  which are widely used throughout the restaurant industry  include short term revenue measures such as average weekly sales and total revenues and long term profitability measures such as return on invested capital  each of which is described in further detail below 
we believe it is helpful to review these measures both in total and by class year ie year of restaurant opening 
average weekly sales represent an average sales amount per restaurant and helps gauge the changes in traffic  pricing and brand development 
it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normal sales volumes and then experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 
total revenues by class year helps assess the sales performance of our new and existing restaurants as well as the growth of each concept as we continue our expansion strategy 
return on invested capital is a key profitability measure that provides an indication of the long term health of our concepts 
this metric is based on a comparison of operating profit to the average capital invested in our 
table of contents restaurants 
we believe return on invested capital is a critical indicator in evaluating our ability to create long term value for our shareholders

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation based on fair value measurement guidance 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  for our options and cash settled liability awards  with the exception of performance units 
these assumptions include estimating expected term  common stock price volatility over the expected term and the number of awards that will ultimately not vest forfeitures 
for performance units  fair value is calculated using a monte carlo simulation model which incorporates the historical performance  volatility and correlation of our stock price and the russell index 
in february  each of our co chief executive officers was granted an award of  performance units 
the cash value of the performance units will be equal to the amount  if any  by which our final average stock price  as defined in the agreements  exceeds the strike price 
the strike price will be adjusted  either up or down  
table of contents based on the percentage change in the russell index during the performance period  as defined in the agreements  which approximates three years 
the performance units were granted in february  and since the grant date  the russell index has increased while our stock has appreciated 
the total value of the performance unit awards was originally subject to a maximum value of per unit 
during december  the performance unit award associated with one of the co chief executive officers was modified such that the maximum value per unit was reduced to per unit 
all other terms remain the same as specified in the original award agreement 
total cumulative expense recognized for the performance units from date of grant through january  was million based on the estimated fair values as of january  of per unit for units with a maximum value of and per unit for units with a maximum value of 
as of january   if the value of the performance units at settlement date is the maximum value per unit  we would recognize additional share based compensation expense of million during fiscal the amount and timing of the recognition of additional expense will be dependent on the estimated fair value at each quarterly reporting date 
any increases in fair value may not occur ratably over the remaining four quarters of the award term  therefore  share based compensation expense related to the performance units could vary significantly in future periods 
additionally  we use assumptions to estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to restricted stock and cash settled liability awards in determining the share based compensation expense for these awards 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect fair value and our estimates of share based compensation expense 
consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income could vary significantly in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least quarterly 
an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances 
for restaurants open greater than two years  negative restaurant level cash flows over the previous twelve month period are considered a potential impairment indicator 
in these situations  we evaluate future restaurant cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans 
based on this assessment  we either a continue to monitor these restaurants over the near term for evidence of improved performance or b immediately recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value  which is based on discounted future cash flows 
in the past  restaurants under monitoring have typically achieved cash flow improvements in a timely fashion such that no impairment charge was deemed necessary and the restaurant was removed from active monitoring 
however  an impairment charge was recognized during fiscal based on our decision to close ten underperforming pei wei restaurants  including several locations that were previously being monitored for impairment 
we did not recognize any impairment charges during fiscal or fiscal our impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and operating outcomes  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment based on our experience and knowledge 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in the economic environment  real estate market conditions and overall operating performance 
at any given time  we are typically actively monitoring a small number of restaurants and impairment charges could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant performance does not improve or if management decides to close that location 
also  if current economic conditions worsen  additional restaurants could be placed on active monitoring and potentially trigger impairment charges in future periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities in the us and international tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income 
table of contents taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end at which time we reconcile our original estimate to the final amounts included in the tax returns 
differences  if any  between our estimate and the final amounts can result in adjustments to income tax expense 
additionally  our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  local and international governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
the returns under audit could be subject to material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws 
on a quarterly basis  we review and update our inventory of tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain positions taken  or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have been adequately resolved 
additionally  uncertain positions may be re measured as warranted by changes in facts or law 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
lease obligations we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term of the lease used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
construction related factors may affect the length of the rent holiday period 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and can result in lower occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning upon our possession of the premises 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is recognized as rent expense in the period incurred 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which tenant incentives received from landlords in connection with certain operating leases for each restaurant are amortized 
from time to time  based on current facts  circumstances and expectations of future results  we may make changes in our assumptions of the likelihood of renewal at the end of the lease term 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid to our insurance carrier or claims administrator amounts that approximate the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims  including known claims and an actuarially determined estimate of incurred but not yet reported claims 
we develop these estimates using historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
our self insurance liabilities are actuarially determined and consider estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of our actual historical trends as well as historical industry data 
if actual claims experience differs from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our insurance reserves would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated income statements 

table of contents partnership structure we utilize a partnership philosophy to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of our restaurants 
historically  this philosophy was embodied in a traditional legal partnership structure  which included capital contributions from our partners in exchange for an ownership stake in the profits and losses of our restaurants 
under this legal partnership program  each partner who wished to participate in our legal partnership structure  to the extent applicable  was required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranged between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
generally  no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant was owned in total by noncontrolling partners 
we performed an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant  utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis 
this methodology involved the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments were required 
we recognized any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners as partner investment expense upon purchase by the partner of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the noncontrolling interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value of the noncontrolling interest is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
prior to fiscal  any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over approximately fifteen years for our bistro restaurants and approximately ten years for our pei wei restaurants 
beginning in fiscal upon the adoption of new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests  an intangible asset is no longer recognized upon buyout of noncontrolling interests 
instead  any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value is recognized as a reduction to additional paid in capital in equity 
effective the beginning of fiscal for new store openings at the bistro and effective april for new store openings at pei wei  a different partnership program is employed to achieve the same goal 
at the restaurant level  our partners at stores opened on or after the effective dates still partners in the philosophical  but not legal  sense no longer have a direct ownership stake in the profits and losses of restaurants  but are instead eligible to receive monthly incentive payments based upon the profitability of their respective restaurants  as well as participate in an incentive program that rewards improvements in the operating performance of their respective restaurants 
in addition  we no longer recognize partner investment expense for new restaurant openings 
incentive payments made to individuals participating in the new program are classified as compensation expense rather than as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
accordingly  in the consolidated statements of income  compensation expense for our restaurant specific operating and culinary partners is reflected as labor expense and for our multi unit market partners  regional vice presidents and bistro market chefs as general and administrative expense 
results of operations we operate on a week year  with the fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to december fiscal years and were each comprised of weeks and fiscal year was comprised of weeks

labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items  workers compensation costs and imputed partner bonus expense 
imputed partner bonus expense represents 
table of contents the portion of restaurant level operating results that is allocable to certain noncontrolling partners  but is presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes

occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property and general liability insurance and property taxes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro occupancy costs increased primarily due to million of additional occupancy costs at our restaurants that opened during fiscal and fiscal and a million increase in property tax expense 
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues increased due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from one fewer operating week during fiscal  higher property tax expense in the current fiscal year  and the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales 

table of contents pei wei occupancy costs increased primarily due to million of additional occupancy costs at our restaurants that opened during fiscal and fiscal and a million increase in property tax expense 
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues were consistent compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from one fewer operating week during fiscal and higher property tax expense  offset primarily by the benefit of improved leverage from higher average weekly sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised of costs associated with corporate and administrative functions that support restaurant development and operations and provide infrastructure to support future growth including  but not limited to  management and staff compensation  employee benefits  travel  legal and professional fees and technology 
the plan participants realized and unrealized holding gains and losses related to liabilities associated with the restoration plan  a nonqualified deferred compensation plan  are included within general and administrative expense  with a corresponding offset for the restoration plan investments in interest and other income expense  net 
consolidated general and administrative costs decreased primarily due to lower management salaries of million due to decreased headcount and lower legal costs of million  partially offset by higher share based compensation expense of million principally resulting from an increase in fair value of the performance units and other cash settled awards 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed assets  gains and losses on disposal of assets and the amortization of intangible assets  software and non transferable liquor license fees 
each segment contributed as follows bistro depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to an increase of million related to new restaurants that opened during fiscal and fiscal  an increase of million due to leasehold improvement additions  and an increase of million due to leasehold improvement asset life adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction due to plateware assets rolled out system wide that were fully depreciated during fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from one fewer operating week during fiscal and the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales

preopening expense preopening expense  consisting primarily of manager salaries  employee payroll and related training costs incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant  is expensed as incurred 
preopening expense also includes the accrual 
table of contents for straight line rent recorded during the period between date of possession and the restaurant opening date for our leased restaurant locations 
each segment contributed as follows bistro preopening expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening four new restaurants during fiscal compared to eight new restaurants during fiscal pei wei preopening expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening two new restaurants in fiscal compared to seven new restaurants in fiscal partner investment expense partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of noncontrolling interests at the time our partners invested in our restaurants and our partners cash contributions for those ownership interests 
additionally  for those interests that are bought out prior to the restaurant reaching maturity typically after five years of operation  partner investment expense includes a reversal of previously recognized expense for the difference between the fair value of the noncontrolling interest at inception date and the fair value at the date of repurchase  to the extent that the former is greater 
each segment contributed as follows bistro the increase in partner investment expense resulted from fewer early buyouts of noncontrolling interests during fiscal compared to fiscal pei wei partner investment expense increased primarily due to the impact of fewer early buyouts during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is partially offset by the change in the partnership program beginning the second quarter of fiscal as a result  partner investment expense is no longer recognized at the time a new restaurant opens 
interest and other income expense  net interest expense primarily consists of interest costs in excess of amounts capitalized related to our outstanding credit line to the extent balances are outstanding and other borrowings  as well as accretion expense related to our conditional asset retirement obligations 
interest income earned primarily relates to advances under the loan facility for fiscal and interest bearing overnight deposits for fiscal realized and unrealized holding gains and losses related to investments in the restoration plan are included within other income expense  with a corresponding offset for the restoration plan liabilities in general and administrative expense 
the change in consolidated interest and other income expense  net was primarily due to million lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the entire million in outstanding credit line borrowings during the second quarter of  partially offset by a million decrease in unrealized holding gains associated with investments in the restoration plan 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations  including discrete items and deduction for noncontrolling interests  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate is impacted by recurring items  such as the fica tip credit  as well as discrete items that may arise in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to the following net discrete tax benefits decrease in state tax expense related to the reconciliation of prior year tax provision to final tax returns  favorable settlements of state income tax audits and interest income related to federal amended returns filed in fiscal the income tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
in fiscal  income from continuing operations increased at a greater rate than fica tip credits generated as compared to fiscal pei wei and global brand development employees are not tipped

provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations  including discrete items and deduction for noncontrolling interests  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal prior fiscal year includes the impact of a change in estimate related to amended tax returns 
additionally  fiscal state tax expense increased over fiscal this is due to an increase in state tax filings  impacts of state tax reform measures and changes in filing methodology as a result of audits 
the income tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
in fiscal  income from continuing operations increased at a greater rate than fica tip credits generated as compared to fiscal because there are no tipped employees at pei wei  as pei wei contributes more net income  and if bistro s income from operations grows at a rate greater than revenue growth  the impact of bistro s tip credit on the company s effective tax rate will continue to decrease

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and available borrowings under our credit facility 
historically  our capital resources have primarily been used for our construction of new restaurants 
more recently  our capital resources have been used for repayments of long term debt  repurchases of our common stock and payments of cash dividends 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the past three fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our funding requirements since inception have been met through sales of equity securities  debt financing and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net income for the periods shown principally due to the effect of depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense  partially offset by a net increase in operating assets and a net decrease in operating liabilities in the current year 
the change in operating activities is primarily due to higher cash paid for income taxes  changes in lease obligations and lower receivables due from third party gift card sales 
investing activities investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  and advances under the loan facility to true food kitchen of million during fiscal capital expenditures have declined since fiscal primarily due to the impact of opening fewer new restaurants during fiscal and new restaurants during fiscal and new restaurants during fiscal compared to new restaurants during fiscal

total cash investment for each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  to  net of estimated tenant incentives and we expect to spend approximately  to  per restaurant for preopening costs 
the anticipated total cash investment per restaurant is based on recent historical averages coupled with expectations of future costs 
we expect total gross capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million to million million to million  net of tenant incentives

table of contents future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have historically been significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
during fiscal  we plan to continue returning excess capital to our shareholders in the form of repurchases of our common stock and payments of cash dividends 
in the longer term  in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we cannot ensure that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
credit facility the senior credit facility credit facility with several commercial financial institutions  allows for borrowings of up to million and expires on august  the credit facility contains customary representations  warranties  negative and affirmative covenants  including a requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of  as well as customary events of default and certain default provisions that could result in acceleration of the credit facility

million of the amount repurchased during fiscal relates to shares that were repurchased under the previous share repurchase program that expired december  but did not settle until after january  at january   there remains million available under our current share repurchase authorization of million  which expires december we plan to repurchase the remaining shares available under the current share repurchase authorization during fiscal cash dividends in february  the board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly variable cash dividend based on our desire to consistently return excess cash flow to our shareholders 
the amount of the cash dividend is calculated based on of our quarterly net income and totaled per share in fiscal we anticipate declaring approximately million to million of cash dividends related to fiscal earnings 
cash dividends are paid quarterly in arrears 
based on seasonal fluctuations in quarterly net income  the amount of cash dividend payments may fluctuate between quarters 
based on the board of directors authorization  on february  we announced a cash dividend of per share which will be paid march  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on february  based on shares outstanding at february   the total dividend payment will approximate million during the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents partnership activities as of january   there were partners within our partnership system representing partnership interests

we purchased of these noncontrolling interests in their entirety for a total of million  all of which was paid in cash 
during fiscal  we will have the opportunity to purchase additional noncontrolling interests which will reach their five year anniversary 
if all of these interests are purchased  the total purchase price will approximate million to million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at january  purchase commitments the following table shows our purchase commitments by category as of january  in thousands payments due by period less greater than than total year years years years long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations related to unexercised lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
additionally  purchase obligations have been included only to the extent that our failure to perform would result in formal recourse against us 
accordingly  certain procurement arrangements that require us to purchase future items are included  but only to the extent they include a recourse provision for our failure to purchase 
other commitments in august  we announced an agreement with frc balance llc  d b a true food kitchen  to provide debt capital for the early stage development of true food kitchen restaurants 
the agreement provides a million loan facility to develop true food kitchen restaurants and can  under certain conditions  convert into a majority equity position in true food kitchen

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in commodities prices as well as fluctuations in the fair value of our cash settled awards 
commodities prices we purchase various commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood and produce 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
historically  we have not used financial 
table of contents instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any significant commodity price increases have historically been relatively short term in nature 
cash settled awards we issued cash settled awards during fiscal and fiscal  including performance units  cash settled stock appreciation rights and cash settled stock based awards 
the fair value of these awards is remeasured at each reporting period until the awards are settled and is affected by market changes in our stock price and  in the case of performance units  the relative performance of our stock to the performance of the russell index 
fair value fluctuations are recognized as cumulative adjustments to share based compensation expense and can vary significantly in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value calculations and fluctuations of our cash settled awards
