item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview general 
we are a leader in the traffic management market focused on the development and application of advanced technologies that reduce traffic congestion and improve the safety of surface transportation systems infrastructure 
additionally  we believe our products and services  in conjunction with sound traffic management  minimize the environmental impact of traffic congestion 
by combining outdoor image processing  traffic engineering and information technology  we offer a broad range of intelligent transportation systems and driver safety solutions to customers in us and internationally 
acquisitions 
in january  we acquired all of the capital stock of meridian environmental technology  inc for an initial cash payment of approximately million 
we also agreed to pay up to million on each of the first two anniversaries of the closing of the acquisition  as well as up to an additional million under a month earn out provision 
in april  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of hamilton signal  which included the abacus system  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report for additional discussion regarding the above acquisitions 
business segments 
we currently operate in four reportable segments roadway sensors  vehicle sensors  transportation systems and environmental technology 

table of contents roadway sensors our roadway sensors segment product line uses advanced image processing technology to capture and analyze video images through sophisticated algorithms  enabling vehicle detection and transmission of both video images and data using various communication technologies 
our vantage video detection systems detect vehicle presence at intersections  as well as vehicle count  speed and other traffic data used in traffic management systems 
our vantage systems give traffic managers the ability to mitigate roadway congestion by modifying traffic signal timing or detecting incidents quickly 
our vantageview software supplements our vantage video detection systems by providing an integrated platform to manage and see video detection assets remotely over a network connection 
versicam  our integrated camera and processor video detection system  is a cost efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that require only a few detection points 
pico  our compact video detection system  was developed primarily to address international video detection needs  and was designed for easy installation and configuration 
our abacus products take advantage of the large number of existing installed closed circuit television video feeds monitoring roadways  signalized intersections  tunnels and bridges to allow for data collection and incident detection without the set up and calibration generally required with other systems 
we believe that future growth domestically and internationally  particularly in developing countries  will be dependent in part on the continued adoption of above ground video detection technologies  instead of traditional in pavement loop technology  to manage traffic 
vehicle sensors our vehicle sensors segment addresses the leading cause of roadway fatalities lane change  roadway departure and rear end collision accidents 
we developed the world s first production ldw system and offer a proven system that is available as an oem and aftermarket option on heavy trucks worldwide and as an option in certain passenger cars 
our ldw products utilize video detection images to detect when a vehicle begins to drift toward an unintended lane change 
when this occurs  the unit automatically emits a distinctive rumble strip or other audible warning sound  alerting the driver to make a correction 
we believe that  as a result of the expected european union mandate for ldw and other active safety systems and an general increase in awareness of the potential benefits of ldw  we will experience an even higher degree of competition from a variety of tier one oem suppliers and other potential market entrants worldwide 
while we believe that this increased competition validates the long term market opportunity for ldw systems in commercial vehicles  it could also adversely affect our future ldw sales and margins 
we are currently working with our european oem customer base to establish long term supply agreements that extend through and beyond in order to meet the anticipated increase in demand  however  we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or that the increase in demand will occur 
we have entered into an exclusive license of our ldw technology to our strategic partner  valeo  for the passenger car market 
recently  we and our partner have experienced a greater degree of competition in the passenger car market  as several passenger car oems have introduced vehicle platforms with competing ldw systems 
however  valeo continues to pursue opportunities in the passenger car market 
in addition to our ldw systems  our vehicle sensors portfolio includes radar based forward collision warning and blind spot warning systems for the north american truck market  and our safetydirect product  a system that reports driver performance data captured by our ldw system  and has the ability to relay this data directly to fleet operators through integration with the truck s existing fleet communications system 
we expect future revenues generated by our safetydirect product will be based on a subscription model  whereby we charge our customers a monthly fee based on the number of vehicles equipped with the product 
we offer the fcw and bsw features through the resale of delphi s radar based systems  for which we are the exclusive north american dealer  while safetydirect was internally developed 
these products  together with our ldw products  combine to create a suite of active safety driver assistance features focused on reducing the number of motor vehicle crashes and the severity of crash related injuries 
transportation systems our transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services focused on the planning  design  development and implementation of software based systems that integrate sensors  video surveillance  computers  and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor  control and direct traffic flow  assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews and distribute real time information about traffic conditions 
our services include planning  design and 
table of contents implementation of surface transportation infrastructure systems 
we perform analysis and study goods movement  commercial vehicle operations  travel demand forecasting and systems engineering  and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion 
historically  these services and systems have primarily been sold to local  state and national transportation agencies in the us under a broad range of fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts  however  in fiscal  we began work on our first two overseas contract awards and plan to pursue additional international opportunities for our transportation systems segment 
our transportation systems segment is largely dependent upon governmental funding and is affected by state and local budgetary issues 
we believe the overall expansion of our transportation systems segment in the future will at least in part be dependent on the passage of a new federal highway bill  which congress is currently working on 
we anticipate continued delays in the enactment of such a new bill  and until such time as a bill becomes law  the allotment of transportation funds in federal  state and local budgets may be uncertain 
we believe that prolonged uncertainty has adversely impacted  and may continue to adversely impact  our net sales and contract revenues and our overall financial performance in future periods 
environmental technology our environmental technology segment is comprised of the activities of met  which we acquired in january this segment specializes in advanced traveler information systems by offering a unique range of customer specific environmental and operational forecasting products and services 
it also utilizes certain internally developed systems and tools as the model for the national guidelines  and currently delivers a combination of customized route specific surface weather  travel times and road condition reports statewide across various states in the us we also provide maintenance decision support system mdss management tools that allow users to create solutions to meet roadway maintenance decision needs 
mdss provides detailed and accurate information at the route level that enables the efficient maintenance of roads and highways while optimizing resource use and reducing costs 
business 
given the current ongoing uncertainties regarding global economic conditions  we continue to remain cautious about our overall business 
since the end users of a majority of our products and services are governmental entities  we are negatively affected by the budgetary issues and delays in purchasing decisions that many municipalities and other state and local agencies continue to face 
spending for new roadways  new systems to address traffic congestion and other transportation infrastructure improvements has been delayed or eliminated in some instances 
however  we believe that the need to rebuild and modernize aging transportation infrastructure will continue  and in addition to funds available through recent federal stimulus packages and federal highway bills  there exist various other funding mechanisms that support transportation infrastructure and related projects 
these include bonds  dedicated sales and gas tax measures and other alternative funding sources 
we believe the overall ongoing unfavorable economic environment has negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  our financial results for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our ability to accurately forecast our future financial performance and other business trends may be impaired 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
product revenues and related costs of sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are typically met at the time of product shipment  but in certain 
table of contents circumstances  may not be met until receipt or acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant obligations or uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
we recognize revenue from the sale of deliverables that are part of a multiple element arrangement in accordance with applicable accounting guidance that establishes a selling price hierarchy permitting the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vendor specific objective evidence vsoe nor third party evidence tpe of fair value is available for that deliverable 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements that have stand alone value in a multiple element arrangement  we are required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration is allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on our estimated selling prices 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software and software related services in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is determined by vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements and the only undelivered element is post contract customer support or maintenance  and vsoe of the fair value of such support or maintenance does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  but vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
we also derive revenue from the provision of specific non recurring contract engineering services to our strategic partner  valeo  related to our ldw systems  and royalties earned on unit sales of our ldw systems by valeo to the passenger car market 
non recurring contract engineering revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed 
royalty revenues are recorded based on unit sales of our products by valeo and are recognized in the period in which such sales occur 
non recurring contract engineering revenues and royalty revenues are included in our net sales 
revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed and are included in our net sales 
contract revenues contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
the majority of our contract revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as contract performance progresses  and is based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
we generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred  divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
costs are generally determined from actual hours of labor effort expended 
direct non labor costs are charged as incurred plus any mark up permitted under the contract 
certain of our contract revenues are recognized as services are performed and amounts are earned  which is measured by time incurred or other contractual milestones or output measure 
contract revenues accounted for in this manner generally relate to certain cost plus fixed fee or time and materials contracts for which no specific maximum contract values are stipulated 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates  including engineering progress  materials quantities  and achievement of milestones  incentives  penalty provisions  labor productivity  cost estimates and others 
such estimates are based on various professional judgments we make with respect to those factors and are subject to change as the project proceeds and new information becomes available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and contract completion costs on our long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from our estimates 
substantially all of our contracts are of the following types cost plus fixed fee 
under cost plus fixed fee contracts  we charge our customers for our costs  including both direct and indirect costs  plus a fixed negotiated fee 

table of contents fixed price 
under fixed price contracts  our customers pay us an agreed fixed amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work 
prior to completion  our recognized profit margins on any fixed price contract depend on the accuracy of our estimates and will increase to the extent that our current estimates of aggregate actual costs are below amounts previously estimated 
conversely  if our current estimated costs exceed prior estimates  our profit margins will decrease and we may realize a loss on a project 
time and materials 
under our time and materials contracts  we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our customers based on the actual time that we spend on a project 
in addition  customers reimburse us for our actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract 
the majority of our time and material contracts are subject to maximum contract values and  accordingly  revenues under these contracts are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general allowance based on our historical collections experience 
considerable judgment is required in assessing and estimating the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventories in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and their estimated realizable value 
these estimates are based on management s judgments and assumptions as to future demand requirements and our evaluation of market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped  so if actual market conditions are more favorable in the fiscal periods subsequent to those in which we record significant write downs  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
acquisitions and intangible assets 
the accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to measure the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets can only be recognized as goodwill in a business combination in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
our intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the intangible assets and consider any changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
any material changes in circumstances  such as significant decreases in revenue or the operating results of one or more of our operating segments  could require future write downs of our intangible assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter at the reporting unit level unless a change in circumstances indicates that an interim impairment analysis is required 
we have determined that our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are identical to our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes 
impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units with the recorded goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined by using the income approach methodology of valuation which utilizes discounted cash flows 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units also includes a control premium  which is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our current budget and our current strategic plan  subject to modification as considered necessary  including sales and expense growth rates and the discount rates we estimate to represent our cost of funds 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and the estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
in the future  the value of goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units could be adversely impacted by  among other factors  declines in our financial results or market capitalization for an extended period of time or our failure to meet financial performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses in the accompanying 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which would adversely affect our product gross profit and our operating results 
income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized  which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be  while also separately considering applicable discrete and other non recurring items  and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and financial results during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which our estimates are refined so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate 
these changes  along with adjustments to our deferred taxes  among others  may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
applicable accounting guidance requires that we review all of our tax positions and make a determination as to whether each position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard  then the related tax benefit is measured based on a cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement or disposition of the underlying issue 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in the statement of operations as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our stock based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized over the requisite service period 
our stock based awards are currently comprised of common stock options and restricted stock units 
the fair value of our common stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula 
while utilizing this model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our common stock option awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
our assumptions under the bsm formula include the following i expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock price  ii the expected life of options is derived based on the historical life of our options  iii the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury interest rates in effect at the time of grant and iv the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we include an estimate of forfeitures in the calculation of stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense in any particular quarter or year could be affected by changes in our assumptions  changes in market conditions  or to the extent that we grant additional stock based awards 
additionally  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues for the periods indicated 
the following table should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
year ended march  net sales and contract revenues net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues costs of net sales and contract revenues cost of net sales cost of contract revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration total operating expenses operating income loss non operating income expense other income  net interest expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of product sales from our roadway sensors and vehicle sensors segments  as well as contract engineering revenue and royalty revenue generated from our vehicle sensors segment 
contract revenues consist of revenues derived from our transportation systems and environmental technology segments 

table of contents the following tables present details of our net sales and contract revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal increase decrease change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues we currently have a diverse customer base with no individual customer representing greater than of our total annual net sales and contract revenues for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal roadway sensors the increase in roadway sensors net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal were driven by higher unit sales domestically from both our direct sales and dealer markets  which was offset in part by lower prices due to competitive pressures 
in the current fiscal year  we also saw particular strength  both domestically and internationally  in certain of our newer product lines which were introduced within the last to months 
additionally  we believe we have recently gained market share as a result of these new product introductions 
however  we cannot assure you that these new products will continue to gain market share or new products we develop in the future will be as successful 
net sales for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal mainly due to the effects of reduced and delayed spending on infrastructure projects  in part due to the decline in commercial and residential construction as well as state and local government budgetary pressures  and increased competition in the market 
vehicle sensors vehicle sensors net sales were primarily made up of sales of our ldw systems to the heavy truck market  which aggregated approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  during fiscal we saw relatively higher unit sales of our ldw products to each of our key markets  particularly to our foreign oem heavy truck customers in japan and europe  as well as our domestic truck fleet customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced slightly lower total unit shipments to japan  as compared to recent prior quarters  which we believe was partially attributable to the crisis caused by the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in that region in march in the near term  we remain uncertain as to whether our sales volumes to this region will be adversely impacted as a result of the crisis 
our fiscal net sales were significantly lower when compared to fiscal levels  as we saw a substantial slowdown in overall ldw unit shipments to each of our key markets  which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe this was driven largely by the weakness in the us and worldwide economy at that time  in which there was a significant decline in new heavy truck sales in general 
although we have experienced improvements in our sales in the current year  we remain cautious in our outlook for the upcoming year 
we anticipate that vehicle sensors unit sales in future periods could be adversely impacted by  among other factors  slower than expected adoption rates of our ldw system across each of our target markets and the continuing uncertainty in the global economic environment 
additionally  future unit sales of ldw systems and unit pricing could be adversely impacted as a result of increased competition in this market 
also included in vehicle sensors net sales are revenues from contract engineering services and royalty revenues in the passenger car market that are derived from our strategic relationship with valeo  which aggregated approximately   and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we have experienced year over year decreases in contract engineering services provided to valeo as the pertinent engineering development activities have generally reached maturity for the related vehicle platforms that currently incorporate our ldw system 
during the current fiscal year  the 
table of contents decrease in contract engineering services provided was partially offset by an increase in our royalty revenues 
our ldw systems are currently offered as an option on four infiniti models 
while valeo is promoting our ldw systems to other passenger car oems  we cannot assure you that valeo will be successful in these efforts 
contract revenues contract revenues are derived from our transportation systems segment  and upon our acquisition of met in january  also include the revenues from our environmental technology segment 
our contract revenues are primarily dependent upon the continued availability of funding at both the state and federal levels from the various departments of transportation 
our fiscal contract revenues include approximately million of revenues attributable to met 
our transportation systems contract revenues have sequentially decreased over the last two fiscal years primarily as a result of the ongoing weakness in the markets this segment serves  which has been aggravated by the general lengthening of the overall sales cycle  from the bid and proposal process  to the signing of a contract and commencement of work on a project 
government budgeting constraints and funding delays or reductions on various existing contracts  particularly in the southeast region of the us  also contributed to the sequential declines in our revenues 
our private planning group  which focuses on private development consulting  has likewise experienced particular weakness over the last two years 
the decrease in our fiscal revenues  as compared to fiscal  was also partially attributable to the timing differences on certain of our larger contracts  which contained a higher amount of sub consultant revenue in fiscal  but such contracts were mostly completed by the end of fiscal and were not replaced with similar contracts in fiscal going forward  we plan to continue to pursue large contracts that may contain significant sub consulting content  which will likely contribute to variability in the timing and amount of our contract revenues from period to period 
we also intend to continue to expand our foreign operations by pursuing additional international opportunities in the middle east and other regions 
among other factors  we believe the ability of both our transportation systems and environmental technology segments to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
gross profit 
the following tables present details of our gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues our total gross profit as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our product and service mix 
in fiscal  our net sales  which are substantially comprised of product sales  represented approximately of our total net sales and contract revenues as compared to in fiscal our net sales generally carry higher margins than our contract revenues derived primarily from our consulting services 
our total gross profit as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues for fiscal increased slightly compared to fiscal primarily due to higher margins from our net sales  particularly roadway sensors  as we realized cost savings due to lower costs of materials driven by improvements in our supply chain management 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was also attributable  to a lesser extent  to the improvement in our transportation systems margins in fiscal  as discussed further below 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of higher overall net sales and margins in roadway sensors during the current year 
such higher margins were largely driven by 
table of contents our customer mix and lower costs for certain key materials 
we generally enjoy higher gross margins on direct sales as compared to dealer and aftermarket sales 
in vehicle sensors  we also experienced a significant improvement in our year over year gross margins as a result of i higher product sales levels in the current year which provided for improved overhead absorption and ii higher royalty revenues from valeo 
the slight increase in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to certain materials cost savings  as discussed above  and a favorable customer mix weighted more toward direct sales 
this increase was partially offset during fiscal by decreased gross margins in vehicle sensors  which was largely driven by lower overhead absorption due to the decline in sales as compared to fiscal  along with an increase in certain estimates for additional excess and obsolete inventory provisions in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on  among other factors  customer and product mix  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  as well as possible shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
we recognize the majority of our contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting  and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
gross profit as percent of contract revenues in fiscal were highly consistent with those of fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a contract mix weighted more toward higher margin contracts in fiscal our higher margin contracts often contain a comparatively lower proportion of sub consulting revenues associated with them 
we expect the variability and timing of contract mix and related sub consulting content in our transportation systems and environmental technology segments in future periods  as well as factors such as paid holidays and our ability to efficiently utilize our workforce  will cause fluctuations in our margins from contract revenues from period to period 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i higher selling and commission related expenses for our roadway sensors and vehicle sensors segments  as total net sales for both segments increased approximately and  respectively  from fiscal levels  ii higher salary and headcount related expenses as we have added certain key sales and marketing personnel in all of our business segments  including as a result of the acquisition of met in january  iii additional consulting and outside services expenses in the vehicle sensors segment related to market research and certain other sales and marketing activities and iv additional legal and professional services related to our acquisition of met  along with various other corporate initiatives 
we also saw a shift from cost of sales to sales and marketing of certain of our headcount expenses in our transportation systems segment in the current year commensurate with the overall decline in this segment s revenues and the reallocation of existing personnel in an effort to expand our contract backlog and increase contract revenues 
however  we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 
additionally  during fiscal  we realized approximately  in reversals of certain previously recorded bad debt expense included in the other category in the table above as a result of collecting certain large accounts receivable balances 
in prior periods  we had recorded an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables given the uncertainty of collection at that time 
in the future  our operating results in any given period may be favorably or adversely impacted as a result of our estimates of the realization of our accounts receivable 

table of contents the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i our overall reduction in headcount during fiscal  ii lower accruals for bonuses and other incentive compensation primarily due to lower sales and operating profit in fiscal  and iii the suspension of our matching contributions under our k plan effective july  we also reduced our professional and outside services expenses during fiscal primarily through our efforts to conserve costs and scale back our usage of such services  along with various efficiencies gained in our internal control assessment and other financial reporting obligations 
research and development expense the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development research and development expenses for fiscal were generally consistent  in total  with those of fiscal during fiscal  we incurred certain additional external costs primarily for development and related activities associated with our vehicle sensors segment 
as compared to the prior year  the increase in these costs was largely offset by lower personnel related expenses 
we believe research and development activities are crucial to our ability to continue to be a leader in our markets 

table of contents the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower overall engineering headcount and a more efficient engineering structure as we shifted our focus to new product development from a historical focus on new customer qualification and manufacturing support 
impairment of goodwill 
we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill for the fiscal years ended march  and based on these assessments  we determined that no impairment as of either of these dates was indicated as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
as of september   we performed the first step in the impairment analysis of the carrying value of goodwill for all reporting units primarily due to the decline in our stock price and market capitalization since our fiscal year ended march  and the ongoing weakness in the economic environment 
this analysis did not result in any impairment charges during the quarter ended september  during the quarter ended december   due primarily to lower than expected operating results in our transportation systems reporting unit  as well as ongoing weakness specifically in the transportation systems markets  we determined it was necessary to perform another interim test of impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in our transportation systems reporting unit as of december  in performing the first step in this analysis  we estimated the fair value of our transportation systems reporting unit using the income approach 
as of december   we determined that the carrying value of our transportation systems reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value  and accordingly  we performed the second step of the impairment analysis to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill of this reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
to determine this value  we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities  including certain intangible assets  to be allocated to the transportation systems reporting unit as of december  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value amounts of its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the transportation systems reporting unit was measured by the amount the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
accordingly  in order to write down transportation systems goodwill with a carrying value of million to its implied fair value of million  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the three months ended december  we estimated the fair value of the transportation systems reporting unit using the income approach  which was based on management s business plans and financial projections for the next five years  along with a perpetual growth rate thereafter of approximately 
the analysis also used a weighted average discount rate of approximately  which we believe reflects our cost of capital  slightly adjusted for increased market risk 
our transportation systems segment has recently been adversely impacted by  among other factors  i continued delays in government spending and resolution of budgetary issues  ii longer than expected lead times in bidding  successfully winning and commencing work on new contracts  and renewing existing contracts  and iii the ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment and the longer than expected economic recovery 

table of contents subsequent to the interim impairment test as of december  described above  we performed our annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of goodwill as of march  based on this assessment  we determined that no impairment as of this date was indicated  as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value 
at march   our roadway sensors  vehicle sensors  transportation systems and environmental technology reporting units had goodwill balances of million  million  million and million  respectively 
we believe we have no goodwill at risk  as the estimated fair values of our roadway sensors  vehicle sensors and transportations systems reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values at march  the fair value of our environment technology reporting unit at march  approximated its carrying value given that the acquisition of met occurred in january if our actual financial results  or the plans and estimates used in future goodwill impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess for impairment of our goodwill  we could incur future goodwill impairment charges 
interest expense  net net interest expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the sequential decreases were primarily due to our lower overall level of borrowings  as we continue to make monthly principal payments on our term note 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional details on our borrowings 
income taxes the following table presents our benefit provision for income taxes for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages benefit provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted unfavorably by a portion of the charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill  amounting to approximately million  for which there is no corresponding tax basis 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the impact of the recognition of approximately  of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recognition of approximately  of unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in estimates of the future realizability of these assets 
as of march  and  respectively  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets as of either such dates 
in making our determination as to the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we reviewed all available positive and negative evidence  including reversal of deferred tax liabilities  potential carrybacks  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
as we update our estimates in future periods  adjustments to our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance may be necessary 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including  but not limited to  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other federal attributes are subject to a section annual limitation 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined at this time  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards will cause us to have future income tax payments that are substantially lower than the income tax liability calculated using statutory tax rates 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and the availability of borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund potential future acquisitions and our future growth 
we may raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution and any equity securities that may be issued may have rights senior to our existing stockholders 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
this compares to working capital of million at march   which included no borrowings on our line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was the result of i million in non cash items within the statement of operations  primarily million for the impairment of goodwill  depreciation expense of million and stock based compensation expense of  and ii  in positive cash flows resulting from changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year  all of which was partially offset by our net loss of million for the year 
our inventories increased approximately  or  from march  to march  as we have built up certain inventories on hand to meet anticipated increases in our product net sales in both roadway sensors and vehicle sensors 
in the future  our inventory levels are likely to continue to be determined based upon  among other factors  the level of purchase orders we receive from our customers  the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we attempt to balance such considerations against risk of obsolescence and potentially excess inventory levels 
the increase in accounts payable by approximately  from march  to march  was driven by our increased inventory levels and the general timing of payments to vendors 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was primarily the result of i our fiscal net income of million  ii million in non cash items within the statement of operations  primarily consisting of adjustments to our deferred tax assets of million  depreciation expense of  and stock based compensation expense of  and iii million in cash resulting from changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our fiscal net income of million adjusted for million of net non cash items within the statement of operations  which was comprised primarily of adjustments to our deferred tax balances of million  offset slightly by depreciation expense of million and stock based compensation  amortization and other items totaling investing activities 
cash used in our investing activities for fiscal consisted of i million used for the acquisition of met and purchases of property and equipment of  in april  we made an additional payment of  related to the met acquisition

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal primarily consisted of million in payments on our long term debt and  for the first anniversary payment for the hamilton signal acquisition 
in april  we made our final payment of  for the hamilton signal acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal consisted of net payments on our long term debt of million 
the net payments on our long term debt during fiscal were partially offset by  in proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was the result of  in cash inflows from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock  partially offset by net payments on our borrowings of  borrowings in october  we entered into a million credit facility with california bank trust the bank  which provided for a two year revolving line of credit with borrowings of up to million and a million month term note discussed below 
in september  we entered into a modification agreement with the bank to extend the expiration date of our revolving line of credit to october  interest on borrowed amounts under the revolving line of credit are payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate at march  up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility 
we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit during the preceding month 
the revolving line of credit does not contain any early termination fees and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit portion of the facility 
availability under this line of credit may be reduced or otherwise limited as a result of our obligations to comply with certain financial covenants  as described further below 
as of march   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under the term note included in our credit facility 
principal payments under this term note are required to be repaid in monthly installments of  commencing on june  additionally  beginning on november   and on november of each year thereafter  we are required to repay additional principal of up to  calculated based on certain financial measures  as further defined in the loan agreement 
these additional principal payments effectively reduce the total number of monthly installments necessary to repay the term note 
to date  we have made additional principal payments of  on each of november  and interest on the term note is payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate plus up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility 
the term note contains no early termination fees and  along with our revolving line of credit discussed above  is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in connection with our credit facility and loan agreement with the bank  we are also required to comply with certain quarterly financial covenants 
these include achieving ratios for working capital and debt service  as well as maintaining a level of profitability  all of which are further defined in the agreement 
while we believe we are currently in compliance with all such financial covenants  we cannot assure you that we will not violate one or more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants under this agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances and pursue its security interest in our assets 
in this event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing on acceptable terms  on a timely basis  or at all 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of financing  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases  which are further described at note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  we do not believe we have any other material off balance sheet arrangements at march  seasonality we have historically experienced seasonality  particularly with respect to our roadway sensors net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to a reduction in road construction and repairs during the winter months due to inclement weather conditions
