company overview we have been purchasing and collecting charged off accounts receivable portfolios paper from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers including private label card issuers  consumer finance companies  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we purchase them at a substantial discount 
over the last ten years  we purchased  consumer debt portfolios  with an original charged off face value of billion for an aggregate purchase price of billion  or of face value  net of buybacks 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize collections 
macro economic factors have impacted our results of operations both positively and negatively over the course of and factors such as reduced availability of credit for consumers  a depressed housing market  elevated unemployment rates and other factors have had a negative impact on us by making it more difficult to collect from consumers on the paper we have acquired 
conversely  as a result of these negative macro economic factors  the supply of available paper increased while prices we paid remained at lower levels than in recent years 
we have observed indicators that some of these trends may be starting to reverse 
for example  we are observing increased competition for available paper and  depending on credit originator  the supply may be decreasing which results in higher pricing 
certain macro economic factors  such as the unemployment rate  also have shown improvement in recent months 
our levels of purchasing increased in when compared to we amended our credit agreement in the second quarter of which significantly increased our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility 
that increased capacity allowed us to increase purchases of paper during the year 
in  we purchased a higher percentage of fresh and primary paper than in recent years 
the cost of paper in the fresh and primary stages of delinquency is typically higher as a percentage of face value  however  collections tend to be received sooner and at a lower cost 
in addition  since this paper has been charged off more recently  it has a longer life for collection activities 
collections during the second half of increased when compared to the same period of  which is the first time we experienced year over year growth since the third quarter of however  full year collections declined when compared to as a result of the difficult collections environment and macro economic factors discussed above  particularly early in first half collections were also negatively impacted by reduced purchasing in when compared to because collections on portfolios are usually the strongest six to months after purchase 
purchased receivable revenues for were higher than even though collections were lower 
this increase in revenue is primarily related to amortization driven by lower impairments 
in  we recorded significant impairments to the carrying values of purchased receivables because we determined that the irrs 
table of contents assigned to certain portfolios were too high in relation to the timing or amount of estimated remaining collections 
during  we exceeded our revised collection forecasts for certain portfolios allowing us to recognize yield increases and reverse certain previously recorded impairments 
if collections continue to exceed our expectations  we may further increase irrs or reverse previous impairments 
however  if collections do not continue to meet expectations  we may be required to record additional impairments 
the increase in revenue on amortizing portfolios during the year was partially offset by a decrease in zero basis collections collections on fully amortized portfolios which are accounted for as revenue in the period collected 
these fully amortized portfolios are generally at least five years old  and become more difficult to collect as they continue to age 
in addition to the items discussed above  our results of operations are influenced by certain industry and economic trends  including levels of outstanding consumer credit according to the us federal reserve board  the amount of outstanding revolving and non revolving consumer credit was trillion in december  which is consistent with the level of outstanding consumer credit in recent years 
the level of consumer debt obligations indicates future charge offs and availability of paper 
tightening credit standards or other factors in the future may result in lower consumer credit outstanding 
charge off rates according to the us federal reserve board  the charge off rate  the rate at which accounts are charged off measured as a percentage of total outstanding consumer credit  increased for the first two quarters and decreased for the second two quarters of the average charge off rate for is higher than the average charge off rate for combined with the stable level of consumer credit outstanding  this indicates that a favorable supply environment for debt purchasers is likely to continue 
supply and pricing environment for purchased receivables the supply and pricing of purchased receivables available in the market is influenced by the levels of outstanding consumer credit and charge off rates  among other factors 
in general  prices increased in for paper in all stages of delinquency  with the most significant change in the fresh and primary segments 
impact of macro economic factors macro economic factors affect consumer s ability to satisfy outstanding debt 
the residential real estate market in the united states began to experience a significant downturn in the second half of and real estate values generally remained depressed during the unemployment rate and the number of individual bankruptcy filings remained elevated during  leaving individual consumers with fewer resources available to satisfy their debts and a continued challenging collection environment 
we continue to review our business and operations and look for opportunities to become more efficient  and in completed the following actions acquisition in july  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of bsi  a software vendor  including the collection software it developed  which we had been implementing to replace our legacy collection platform 
we made the acquisition to protect our investment in the software acquired and to enhance our ability to successfully complete implementation 
in addition  we believe this acquisition allows us to further enhance our collection platform in an efficient and cost effective manner 
termination of third party agency relationship we incurred a charge of million resulting from the termination for performance of a relationship with a third party service provider 
the charge relates to a cash settlement payment to reimburse the third party for court costs incurred on our behalf that the third party would otherwise have recovered through commission in future periods 
exited the purchase and collection of healthcare receivables during the year  we exited the healthcare accounts receivable purchase and collection activities conducted by our parc subsidiary 
table of contents and sold substantially all of our healthcare receivables to a third party 
we recognized a gain of million on the sale of these receivables 
because of the sale  we will forego future collections on these accounts 
the historical impact of these collections was as follows year ended december  in thousands collections from non healthcare receivables collections from healthcare receivables total collections closing of the deerfield beach office and dissolution of parc in connection with ceasing the purchase and collection of healthcare receivables  we closed our deerfield beach office and dissolved our parc subsidiary 
closing the deerfield beach office resulted in restructuring charges of million  which included an impairment of million related to trademark and trade names 
during  we recognized a related impairment charge of million to trademark and trade names 
we expect this restructuring action to reduce future operating expenses by approximately million per year 
in conjunction with dissolving the parc subsidiary  we recognized a one time tax benefit of million 
closed offices in addition to closing our deerfield beach office  we closed our chicago and cleveland call center collection operations and shifted their inventory of receivables to other collection channels 
in conjunction with closing these operations  we incurred restructuring charges of million 
we expect these restructuring actions to reduce future operating expenses by approximately million per year 
in addition  during  as part of our continuous review of our cost structure  we implemented a number of additional initiatives  focusing primarily on third party vendor spending  that are expected to favorably impact expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues and as a percentage of cash collections for the periods indicated percent of total revenues percent of cash collections years ended december  years ended december  revenues purchased receivable revenues gain on sale of purchased receivables other revenues total revenues expenses salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring charges impairment of assets loss on disposal of equipment and other assets total operating expense income loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income other loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of charged off consumer receivables 
we refer to revenue generated from this line of business as purchased receivable revenues 
purchased receivable revenues is the difference between cash collections and amortization of purchased receivables 
the following table summarizes our purchased receivable revenues including cash collections and amortization years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change cash collections purchased receivable amortization purchased receivable revenues the amortization rate of for the year ended december  was basis points lower than the amortization rate of for the same period of the improvement in the amortization rate was primarily because of net impairments of million recorded in the impairments were a result of significant declines in expectations for future collections on certain portfolios  particularly in the to vintage years 
by contrast  results for included net impairment reversals of million 
even though amortization as a percent of collections was more favorable in compared to the prior year  revenues  absent the effect of impairments  were lower as a result of a decrease in collections on fully amortized portfolios  a lower average carrying value of purchased receivables as a result of the impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of  and lower average irrs on recent purchases 
refer to supplemental performance data on page for a summary of purchased receivable revenues and amortization rates by year of purchase and an analysis of the components of collections and amortization 
we believe that macro economic factors affecting consumers liquidity and their ability to repay their obligations  and the low levels of purchasing in contributed to lower cash collections in compared to macro economic factors reducing consumers ability to pay included the average unemployment rate over the twelve month period  which increased from in december to in december  a depressed housing market and a continued tight credit environment for consumers  among other factors 
in addition  during  we invested less in purchased receivables than we did in generally  collections are strongest on portfolios six months to months after purchase  therefore  that reduction in purchasing had a negative impact on collections in  primarily during the first half of the year 
cash collections include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million for and  respectively  of which were reported as revenue 
these fully amortized portfolios are generally at least five years old  and become more difficult to collect as they continue to age 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers were million and million during and  respectively 
the top three sellers were the same in both twelve month periods 

table of contents investments in purchased receivables we generate revenue from our investments in portfolios of charged off consumer accounts receivable 
ongoing investments in purchased receivables are critical to continued generation of revenues 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  types and demographics 
as a result  the cost of our purchases  as a percent of face value  may fluctuate from one period to the next 
total purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions  net of buybacks change percent acquisitions of purchased receivables at cost acquisitions of purchased receivables at face value percentage of face value our investment in purchased receivables increased in compared to the prior year  which was consistent with our strategy to increase purchasing levels over those in we purchased of paper in the fresh and primary stages of delinquency in compared to during fresh and primary paper generally have a higher purchase price than paper in the other stages of delinquency 
as a result of fluctuations in the mix of purchases of receivables  the costs of our purchases  as a percent of face value  fluctuate from one period to the next and are not always indicative of our estimates of total return 
investments under forward flow contracts forward flow contracts commit a debt seller to sell a steady flow of charged off receivables to us  and commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face value 
forward flow contracts may be attractive to us because they provide operational advantages from the consistent amount and type of accounts acquired 
forward flow purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions  net of buybacks change percent forward flow purchases  at cost forward flow purchases  at face value percentage of face value percentage of forward flow purchases  at cost of total purchasing percentage of forward flow purchases  at face value of total purchasing investments in forward flow contracts were higher in than in the same period in  but represented a smaller percentage of total purchases because of an increase in other types of purchasing 
through  investments in forward flows made up a majority of our purchasing  which was consistent with our intent to lower total purchasing levels but maintain our fixed agreements with certain sellers 
the increase in the average cost of these purchases in compared to was primarily a result of increased purchases of more recently charged off receivables 
fresh and primary paper represented of our forward flow purchases in compared to in purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
operating expenses operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections  as we believe this is appropriate because amortization rates  the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  vary from year to year 
amortization rates vary due to seasonality of collections  impairments and other factors and can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of our operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 

table of contents the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating expenses years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative restructuring and impairment of assets other total operating expenses salaries and benefits 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our salaries and benefits expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change compensation revenue generating compensation administrative benefits and other total salaries and benefits compensation for our revenue generating departments was lower in due to lower average headcount for in house account representatives  partially offset by increased incentive compensation 
benefits were favorable to the prior year due to the suspension of the company matching component of our k plan and favorable healthcare benefits expenses  in part a result of increased associate contributions for these benefits 
collections expense 
the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaign and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense forwarding fees include fees paid to third parties to collect on our behalf including our agency firm in india 
these fees increased in compared to because of higher cash collections generated by third parties  primarily driven by continued increases in non legal work allocated to our agency firm in india 
collections from such third party relationships were million and million  or and of cash collections  for and  respectively 
rates paid to forwarding agencies vary based on the age and type of paper that we outsource 
rates also vary based on the mix of work performed by our agency firm in india  which is generally at a lower rate than on collections we outsource domestically 

table of contents court costs increased year over year as we increased legal activity  and also because of increases in court filing fees in certain jurisdictions 
our legal collection model requires an up front investment in court costs and other fees before any collections are generated  and there may be considerable delay before we generate collections on the accounts in the legal process 
this delay can cause a change in court costs that is disproportionate to the change in legal collections 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million resulting from the termination for performance of a relationship with a third party service provider 
the charge relates to a cash settlement payment to reimburse the third party for court costs incurred on our behalf that the third party  would otherwise have recovered through commissions in future periods 
we expect to recover these costs through lower commissions on future collections 
during  we became more selective in our variable collection activities  such as telecommunications  lettering campaigns and use of data provider services  resulting in reductions in the related expenses 
generally  these costs are higher in the first six months after purchase of a portfolio as we ramp up collection activities 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of closing our deerfield beach and chicago collection offices during the year 
in addition  during  we entered into two new lease agreements to replace our facilities in san antonio and phoenix now located nearby in tempe 
the new lease agreements in san antonio and tempe are for less space than the prior agreements  which resulted in reduced occupancy expense during we continue to review our capacity to ensure we are utilizing all of our space effectively 
administrative 
administrative expenses increased to million in from million for the increase is primarily related to defense charges for the ftc investigation  including an accrual for estimated settlement of million  partially offset by a reduction in outside consulting fees 
restructuring and impairment of assets 
restructuring charges were million for and included charges related to exiting our healthcare receivable purchase and collection activities and closing three collection offices 
the charges included employee termination benefits of million  contract termination costs of million for remaining lease payments  write off of intangible assets of million and other exit costs  including the write off of furniture and equipment  of million 
we recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of related to trademark and trade names associated with our healthcare collection activities 
after the additional write off of million in  there was no longer a carrying value of trademark and trade names in our consolidated statements of financial position 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for  an increase of million compared to interest expense of million for during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we amended our credit agreement  which resulted in additional deferred financing costs that will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher amortization of these deferred financing costs of million 
in addition  the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average borrowings  which were million during compared to million in the amendments to our credit agreement included an increase in average interest rates and changes to the financial covenants 
as a result  interest expense will be higher in future periods than it would have been under the terms of the agreement prior to amendment 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
income taxes 
we recognized income tax benefits of million and million for and  respectively 
the current year tax benefit reflects a federal tax rate of and a state tax rate of net of federal tax effect 
for  the federal tax rate was and state tax rate was net of federal tax effect 
the rate differed from the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to our decision to dissolve parc  which resulted in i a benefit of million related to a worthless stock deduction to be claimed for our disposition of parc  ii a benefit of million related to the write off of intercompany advances to parc  iii an expense of million related to the write off of intangible assets associated with parc  and iv an expense of million related to the write off of parc s prior net operating losses that will no longer be recognizable in future periods 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of charged off consumer receivables 
we refer to revenue generated from this line of business as purchased receivable revenues 
purchased receivable revenues is the difference between cash collections and amortization of purchased receivables 
the following table summarizes our purchased receivable revenues including cash collections and amortization years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change cash collections purchased receivable amortization purchased receivable revenues the decrease in purchased receivable revenues was primarily the result of lower cash collections and higher amortization  including net impairments  in compared to we believe that the lower cash collections were primarily a result of macro economic factors affecting consumers liquidity and their ability to repay their obligations 
macro economic factors reducing consumers ability to pay include the unemployment rate  which increased from at december to at december  falling residential real estate values and a tighter credit environment for consumers  among other factors 
in addition  we reduced purchasing in the first half of in anticipation of increased supply and therefore lower prices in the second half of the year 
we purchased over of our receivables during in the second half of the year  including of our total purchases in the fourth quarter alone 
by following this strategy  we generated lower cash collections on investments in purchased receivables than if we had invested more in paper earlier in the year 
cash collections for the years ended december  and include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million  respectively  of which were reported as revenue 
in addition  our portfolios become more difficult to collect as they age  and we expect that performance on our older vintages  particularly and earlier  will not recover from the current economic downturn 
we expect the macro economic environment to continue to negatively affect collections during the increase in amortization of purchased receivables in compared to was primarily the result of a million increase in net impairments  partially offset by lower amortization of purchased receivables balances caused by lower collections 
we experienced shortfalls in our actual cash collections versus our expectations  most notably on purchases made before we believe collections on these older vintages have been impacted to a greater extent by the challenging collections environment and because the accounts are older and the collection methods that we use often become less effective as accounts age 
we continually review a number of factors related to our forecast of cash collections 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter and year ended december   we observed a significant difference between our estimated and actual cash collections  which caused us to perform a more in depth review of our portfolios and their expected future performance 
based on our review  we expect these older vintages to continue to underperform our previous collections forecasts 
this reduction in future expectations of cash collections on the vintages resulted in an impairment of million during the fourth quarter of total net impairments recognized in were million compared to million for 
table of contents we believe that the discount we applied to the estimated remaining collections on the vintages should reduce the magnitude of impairments resulting from the economic downturn recognized on those vintages in the future 
the and newer paper is not experiencing the same magnitude decline in collections as compared to expectations  generally because the initial expectations for these purchases were set at lower levels commensurate with the economic downturn in existence at the time of those purchases 
we expect to continue to set more conservative initial expectations on purchases in the near future as we recover from the economic downturn 
purchased receivable revenues fluctuate based on changes in the balance of purchased receivables  the irr applied to each portfolio and the amount of net impairments recognized 
impairments are generated when current yields assigned to portfolios are too high in relation to the timing and or amount of current or future collections 
when cash collections decline a larger portion of collections is allocated to revenue and less is allocated to amortization of portfolio balances 
portfolio balances that amortize too slowly in relation to current or expected collections lead to impairments  which increase the amount of amortization and offset revenue 
the amortization rate of for increased percentage points from the amortization rate of for we are experiencing lower collection rates relative to purchase price than we have historically for all vintage years 
the economic downturn has lowered the amounts that we collect on our investments in purchased receivables  and combined with higher prices on the older vintages due to increased competition during the timeframe  is causing an increase in total amortization as a percentage of cash collection 
refer to supplemental performance data on page for a summary of purchased receivable revenues and amortization rates by year of purchase 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers during vintage years through were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  with one of the three sellers included in the top three in both twelve month periods 
investments in purchased receivables we generate revenue from our investments in portfolios of charged off consumer accounts receivable 
ongoing investments in purchased receivables are critical to continued generation of revenues 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  types and demographics 
as a result  the cost of our purchases  as a percent of face value  may fluctuate from one period to the next 
total purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions change percent acquisitions of purchased receivables at cost acquisitions of purchased receivables at face value percentage of face value our investment in purchased receivables declined in versus because of our strategy to defer purchasing into the latter part of the year with the expectation that pricing would continue to improve and that our investments would generate better returns if we purchased at lower price points by waiting 
additionally  we were cautious in our investments because borrowing under our credit facility to fund investments in purchased receivables was potentially limited by our then existing financial covenants that had scheduled step downs during we considered amending the credit facility to create additional capacity to purchase in late and the first half of  but the credit markets were under substantial disruption which made it difficult to justify amending the credit facility given the anticipated additional cost  both up front and ongoing 
during the fourth quarter of  the credit markets were more stable allowing us to amend the credit facility under more favorable terms than if we had amended it before then 
the amendment increased the interest rates we pay and adjusted the financial covenants 

table of contents investments under forward flow contracts forward flow contracts commit a debt seller to sell a steady flow of charged off receivables to us  and commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face value 
forward flow contracts may be attractive to us because they provide operational advantages from the consistent amount and type of accounts acquired 
forward flow purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions change percent forward flow purchases  at cost forward flow purchases  at face value percentage of face value percentage of forward flow purchases  at cost of total purchasing percentage of forward flow purchases  at face value of total purchasing investments in forward flow contracts declined in from in substantially the same proportion as our total purchases declined for the same period 
because we expected pricing to decline during  we were selective in entering into forward flow commitments during the early part of the year so that we were not locked into above market pricing later in the year 
additionally  since some forward flow contracts are of a twelve month duration and we did not commit early in the year  we lost the opportunity to invest in these contracts during the latter part of purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
operating expenses operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues 
however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because amortization rates  the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  vary from year to year 
amortization rates vary due to seasonality of collections  impairments and other factors and can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe that the majority of our operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating expenses years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative other total operating expenses the majority of the decrease in operating expenses is a result of reductions in salaries and benefits  collections expense and administrative expenses 
as we experienced year over year declines in cash collections  we reduced operating expenses to reflect the lower levels of cash collections 
while the dollar amount of operating expenses declined  some categories of operating expenses increased as a percentage of cash collections because the decline in cash collections was greater than the decline in operating expenses 
we did not reduce operating expenses proportionately to the decline in cash collections in anticipation of increased purchasing in the second half of and into 
table of contents salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits expense decreased because of lower variable incentive compensation and benefits driven by lower cash collections 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our salaries and benefits expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change compensation revenue generating compensation administrative benefits and other total salaries and benefits the decrease in collections resulted in lower variable compensation expense for in house account representatives 
in addition  we reduced incentive compensation for management because of declining performance metrics and have suspended the company matching component of our k plan 
in june of  we began an initiative to increase the number of in house account representatives 
by the end of the year  we increased those associates by approximately from mid second quarter levels 
variable compensation will have an impact on salaries and benefits expense in  depending on the level of cash collections and achievement of incentive goals

overall  collections expense was relatively flat year over year 
the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense and the changes in each years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaign and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense forwarding fees include fees paid to third parties to collect on our behalf 
these fees increased in compared to because of higher rates paid  partially offset by reduced cash collections generated by third parties 
the percent of gross cash collections from such third party relationships were and for and  respectively 
rates paid to forwarding agencies vary based on the age and type of paper that we outsource 
late in  we began incurring costs related to our agency relationship with a firm in india  which we have engaged to collect on our behalf using our technology and collections model under a per seat fee arrangement 
we expect fees paid under this relationship to increase in as the number of seats increases 
court costs and process server costs decreased year over year as we reduced the activity in these categories 
in  we entered into a third party relationship that has allowed us to better match legal costs with the associated collections 
during and  this relationship has resulted in lower court costs offset by higher forwarding fees based on cash collections 
in the future  we expect to place fewer accounts with this third party 
during  we became more selective in our variable collection activities  such as telecommunications  lettering campaigns  and use of data provider services  resulting in reductions in the related expenses 
occupancy 
while occupancy expense remained consistent in compared to  we continue to review our capacity to ensure we are utilizing all of our space effectively 
in late  we entered into a sublease agreement  which will expire in early  for a portion of our now abandoned phoenix facility 
in addition  
table of contents during  we entered into two new lease agreements to replace our facilities in san antonio and phoenix now located nearby in tempe 
the new lease agreements in san antonio and tempe are for less space than the prior agreements  which we expect to reduce occupancy expense in future periods 
administrative 
administrative expenses decreased during in almost all areas  reflecting on our focus on cost control 
we intend to continue to be diligent in controlling these costs even as collections return to pre levels 
impairment of assets 
impairment of our trademark and trade names intangible asset was million for the year ended december  we performed an assessment of the fair value of the asset using a discounted cash flow methodology and determined that it was below the carrying value  primarily as a result of a decline in business activity related to the asset 
during  we decided to no longer service healthcare receivables on a contingent fee basis 
as a result  we recognized a charge of million to impair the net carrying balance of intangible assets for customer contracts and relationships associated with the contingent healthcare collection business 
we also recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off an investment in a new software product after a decision to discontinue its implementation 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to interest expense of million for interest expense was of cash collections during compared with for the decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest rates and decreased average borrowings during compared to the same period in average borrowings were million for the year ended december  compared to million for during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement  which included an increase in average interest rates and changes to the financial covenants 
as a result  interest expense will be higher in future periods than it would have been under the terms of the agreement prior to amendment 
the increase in interest rates will have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in  if our average borrowing levels remain consistent

for the year ended december   the federal tax rate was and state tax rate was net of federal tax effect 
the percentage point decrease in the federal tax rate was the effect of permanent book verses tax differences and the net effect of state taxes

table of contents supplemental performance data the following tables and analysis show select data related to our purchased portfolios including purchase price  account volume and mix  historical collections  cumulative and estimated remaining collections  productivity and certain other data that we believe is important to understanding our business 
total estimated collections as a percentage of purchase price provides a view of how acquired portfolios  generally disclosed by vintage year  have performed as compared to initial purchase price 
this percentage reflects how well we expect our paper to perform  regardless of the underlying mix 
also included is a summary of our purchased receivable revenues by year of purchase  which provides additional vintage detail of collections  net impairments or reversals and zero basis collections 
the primary factor in determining purchased receivable revenue is the irr assigned to the carrying value of portfolios 
when carrying balances go down or assigned irrs are lower than historical levels  revenue will generally be lower 
when carrying balances increase or assigned irrs go up  revenue will generally be higher 
purchased receivable revenue also depends on the amount of impairments or impairment reversals recognized 
when collections fall short of expectations or future expectations decline  impairments may be recognized in order to write down a portfolio s balance to reflect lower estimated total collections 
when collections exceed expectations or the future forecast improves we may reverse previously recognized impairments or increase assigned irrs when there are no previous impairments to reverse 
zero basis collections are collections on portfolios that no longer have a carrying balance and therefore do not generate revenue by applying an assigned irr 
these collections are recognized as purchased receivables revenues in the period collected

the monthly yield is the weighted average yield determined by dividing purchased receivable revenues recognized in the period by the average of the beginning monthly carrying values of the purchased receivables for the period presented 
core amortization the table below shows components of revenue from purchased receivables  the amortization rate and the core amortization rate 
we use the core amortization rate to monitor performance of pools with remaining balances  and to determine if impairments  impairment reversals  or yield increases should be recorded 
core amortization trends may identify over or under performance compared to forecasts for pools with remaining balances 

table of contents the following factors contributed to the change in amortization rates from the prior year amortization of receivables balances for increased compared to prior years 
portfolio balances that amortize too slowly in relation to current or expected collections may lead to impairments 
if portfolio balances amortize too quickly and we expect collections to continue to exceed expectations  previously recognized impairments may be reversed  or if there are no impairments to reverse  assigned yields may increase  net impairments are recorded as additional amortization  and increase the amortization rate  while net reversals have the opposite effect 
net impairment reversals for reduced total amortization compared to prior years  and declining zero basis collections in compared to prior years partially offset the decreased amortization rate because of these collections are recorded as revenue and do not contribute towards portfolio amortization

account representative tenure and productivity we measure traditional call center account representative tenure by two major categories  those with less than one year of experience and those with one or more years of experience 
the following table displays the experience of our account representatives in house account representatives  including supervisors  by experience years ended december  one year or more less than one year total based on number of average traditional call center full time equivalent fte account representatives and supervisors with one or more years of service 
based on number of average traditional call center fte account representatives and supervisors with less than one year of service  including new associates in training 

table of contents off shore account representatives years ended december  number of account representatives based on number of average off shore account representatives staffed by a third party agency measured on a per seat basis 
includes activity beginning in november averaged over the month period 
the following table displays our account representative productivity overall account representative collection averages years ended december  overall collection averages prior year amounts were adjusted to remove supervisors from the collection average which is consistent with the current presentation 
supervisors do not have collection goals  therefore  we believe this presentation better represents our collection averages 
in house account representative average collections per fte increased during by as compared to account representative productivity improved as a result of a increase in purchasing in coupled with a more effective training program and better utilization of our standardized collection methodology 
in house account representative average collections per fte decreased in by as compared to  primarily as a result of the impact of macro economic factors on consumers 

table of contents cash collections the following tables provide further detailed vintage collection analysis on an annual and a cumulative basis historical collections in thousands year of purchase purchase price years ended december  pre total cumulative collections in thousands year of purchase purchase price total through december  cumulative collections as percentage of purchase price year of purchase purchase price total through december  does not include proceeds from sales of receivables 
includes portfolios from the acquisition of parc on april  that were allocated a purchase price value of million 
purchase price refers to the cash paid to a seller to acquire a portfolio less buybacks and the purchase price for accounts that were sold at the time of purchase to another debt purchaser 

table of contents seasonality the success of our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level  excluding the impact of impairments  due to the application of the provisions prescribed by the interest method of accounting 
in addition  our operating results may be affected by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our systems  and collections on portfolios are usually the strongest six to months after purchase 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the following table illustrates our quarterly cash collections cash collections quarter amount amount amount amount amount first second third fourth total cash collections the following table illustrates cash collections and percentages by source years ended december  call center collections legal collections total cash collections certain cash collections have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the average collection payment size grew to during this increase reflects the net impact of an increase in the size of average call center collection payments and a decrease of in the size of average legal payments when compared to the increase in call center payment size was a result of collections on paper with higher average balances coupled with a more effective training program  better utilization of our standardized collection methodology  and more targeted lettering and dialing strategies 
the overall decline in the size of payments from the legal channel was influenced by improvements in our in house dialing and lettering strategies offset by negative trends in our ability to garnish assets 
the average payment size of collections fell to during when compared to average payments in both of our collection channels decreased during this period  generally as a result of the impact of macro economic factors on consumers 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings 
we have traditionally used cash for acquisitions of purchased receivables  repayment of bank borrowings  purchasing property and equipment and working capital to support growth 
we believe that cash generated from operations 
table of contents combined with borrowings currently available under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables  working capital to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or increase the availability under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings we maintain an amended credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein  that originated on june  the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we have a five year million revolving credit facility which expires in june the revolving credit facility  which may be limited by financial covenants  and a six year million term loan facility which expires in june the term loan facility and together with the revolving credit facility  the credit facilities 
the credit facilities bear interest at to basis points over the bank s prime rate depending upon our liquidity  as defined in the credit agreement 
alternately  at our discretion  we may borrow by entering into one  two  three  six or twelve month london inter bank offer rate libor contracts at rates between to basis points over the respective libor rates  depending on our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility includes an accordion loan feature that allows us to request a million increase as well as sublimits for million of letters of credit and for million of swingline loans 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain covenants and restrictions that we must comply with  which as of december  were leverage ratio as defined cannot exceed i to at any time before december  or ii to at any time thereafter  ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth as defined cannot exceed i to at any time on or before december   ii to at any time on or after december  and on or before march   iii to at any time thereafter  and consolidated tangible net worth as defined must equal or exceed million plus of positive consolidated net income for three consecutive fiscal quarters ending december  and for each fiscal year ending thereafter  such amount to be added as of december  and as of the end of each such fiscal year thereafter 
on may   the company  jpmorgan chase bank  na and other lenders entered into a third amendment to credit agreement third amendment 
the third amendment adjusted the levels of the leverage ratio used to set the applicable margin on outstanding borrowings and the respective interest spreads 
the third amendment also changed certain financial covenant definitions to allow for adjustments related to charges for the ftc investigation  limited to million  and the net impact of the fourth quarter purchased receivable impairment charges  limited to million 
the changes did not impact total available borrowing capacity  however  the financial covenants were adjusted to be less restrictive  which in turn increased our ability to borrow under the terms of the agreement 
in exchange for amending the credit agreement  we incurred deferred financing costs of million and million in and  respectively 
the financial covenants restrict our ability to borrow against the revolving credit facility 
at december   total available borrowings on our revolving credit facility were million  however  our capacity to borrow under the terms of the financial covenants was limited to million 
the limitation is based on the leverage ratio  our most restrictive covenant at december  our borrowing capacity will be reduced under this ratio if we experience further declines in cash collections or increases in operating expenses that are not offset by a reduction in outstanding borrowings 

table of contents the credit agreement contains a provision that requires us to repay excess cash flow as defined to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our term loan facility 
the excess cash flow repayment provisions are of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was less than or equal to to but greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  or if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to to as of the end of such fiscal year 
based on the excess cash flow provisions  we made required payments of million and million on the term loan facility during march and  respectively 
payment of the excess cash flow did not reduce our total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
we are not required to make an excess cash flow payment for based on our operating activities  primarily driven by our increase in purchases during the year 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility are paid quarterly  in arrears  and are calculated as an amount equal to a margin of  depending on our liquidity  on the average amount available on the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement requires us to effectively cap  collar or exchange interest rates on a notional amount of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility 
as such  we have an interest rate swap agreement that hedges a portion of the interest on the term loan facility 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  derivative financial instruments and risk management for additional information 
we had million and million of borrowings outstanding on our credit facilities at december  and  respectively  of which million and million was outstanding on the term loan facility and million and million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
along with the excess cash flow prepayment requirements  the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments totaling million annually until expiration 
the decrease in total outstanding borrowings in was a result of the required excess cash flow payment of million and the quarterly repayments totaling million on the term loan facility 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million on the revolving credit facility to fund higher portfolio purchases during the year 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings  including the effect of the interest rate swap  at december  was 
the increase in interest rates resulting from the amendment to the credit agreement in will have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in  if our borrowing levels remain consistent 
we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit agreement as of december  cash flows the majority of our purchases of receivables have been funded with internal cash flow and with borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables primarily by using internal cash flow 
our cash balance increased from million at december  to million as of december  we also made net repayments on our credit facilities of million during our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for these years was generated primarily from operating income earned through cash collections as adjusted for non cash items and 
table of contents the timing of payments of income taxes  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we rely on cash generated from our operating activities and from the principal collected on our purchased receivables  included as a component of investing activities  to allow us to fund operations and re invest in purchased receivables 
cash provided by operations has decreased as a result of net amortization of receivables balances and the impact of impairments  and higher operating expenses 
in the current year  we recorded net impairment reversals of million  which is a negative non cash adjustment to net income when determining cash flow from operating activities 
in and  we recorded net impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which is a positive non cash adjustment to net income when determining cash flow from operating activities 
declines in cash collections  if not offset by reductions in operating expenses will decrease cash provided by operating activities in future periods 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in cash used by investing activities in is a result of million invested in purchased receivables in the as compared to million in the increase in purchasing has been partially offset by principal collected on purchased receivables balances of million for  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our purchasing objectives 
during the first half of  we intentionally reduced our level of investment in paper to build capacity to invest more in the second half of the year and throughout as a result  we used more cash in investing activities for purchases of paper in and compared to we acquired million  million and million in property and equipment in  and  respectively  primarily related to software and computer equipment for our new collection platform and improvements to our telecommunications systems 
implementation of the new collection platform has been funded through cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also acquired substantially all of the assets of our collection platform software provider during for million 
financing activities used cash of million  million and million for  and  respectively  primarily due to net repayments on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility of million  million and million  respectively 
we also made payments for deferred financing fees of million  million and million in  and  respectively  that were associated with the first  second and third amendments to the credit agreement 
cash provided by financing activities would increase in future periods to the extent we use additional net borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund purchases of paper 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as net loss or income plus a the benefit provision for income taxes  b interest expense  net  c depreciation and amortization  d share based compensation  e gain or loss on sale of assets  net  f non cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets  g purchased receivables amortization  and h in accordance with our credit facilities  certain ftc charges 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net loss income prepared on a us gaap basis 
adjusted ebitda does not purport to represent cash flow provided by  or used in  operating activities as defined by us gaap  which is presented in our statements of cash flows 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income  taxes  depreciation and amortization including purchased 
table of contents receivables amortization  and share based compensation  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry 
our management uses adjusted ebitda for planning purposes  including in the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts  in communications with the board of directors  stockholders  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance  as a significant factor in determining bonuses under management s annual incentive compensation program  and as a measure of operating performance for the financial covenants in our amended credit agreement  because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows for investments in purchased receivables  capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the following table reconciles net loss income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure  to adjusted ebitda years ended december  net loss income adjustments income tax benefit expense interest expense  net depreciation and amortization share based compensation gain loss on sale of assets  net non cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets purchased receivables amortization ftc related charges adjusted ebitda adjustments to adjusted ebitda for include charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and write off of furniture and equipment totaling million  included in restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this treatment is consistent with how those expenses would have been reflected in the reconciliation had they been incurred absent a restructuring action 
the remaining restructuring charges of million reduced adjusted ebitda for collections  other revenue and operating expenses  net of the adjustment items  are the primary drivers of adjusted ebitda 
during  adjusted ebitda was million lower than this decline is primarily a result of a decline in cash collections of million combined with an increase in applicable operating expenses of million 
these operating expenses include a million charge for contract termination and million related to the restructuring actions discussed above 
for  the decline in adjusted ebitda of million compared to was a result of a million decrease in collections offset in part with a decrease in applicable operating expenses of million 

table of contents future contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  years ending december  thereafter operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations forward flow obligations revolving credit term loan contractual interest on derivative instruments total we have three forward flow contracts that have terms beyond december  with the last contract expiring in february one forward flow contract expires in january with estimated monthly purchases of approximately million 
the remaining two forward flow contracts expire in february and have estimated monthly purchases of approximately million 
to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in june or earlier as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on our revolving credit facility is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our term loan facility  it would be due in june the variable interest is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  we have a liability of million relating to uncertain tax positions  which has been excluded from the table above because the amount and fiscal year of the payment cannot be reliably estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generally account for our revenues from collections on our purchased receivables by using the interest method in accordance with us gaap  which requires making reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash collections 
application of the interest method requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are primarily based on historical cash collections and payer dynamics 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing from the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
the estimates of remaining collections are sensitive to the inputs used and the performance of each pool 
performance is dependent on macro economic factors and the specific demographic makeup of the debtors in the pool 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on reversal of impairments or an increase in yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in impairments of receivables balances 

table of contents impairments to purchased receivables reduce our consolidated tangible net worth and put pressure on the financial covenants in our credit facilities 
we use the cost recovery method when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
the cost recovery method may be used for pools that previously had an irr assigned 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until we have fully collected the pool s balance 
we adopted the interest method in january and apply it to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of the interest method that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend previously followed guidance for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to purchased receivables acquired before january  we purchase pools of homogenous accounts receivable and record each pool at its acquisition cost 
pools purchased after may be aggregated into one or more static pools within each quarter  based on common risk characteristics 
risk characteristics of purchased receivables are assumed to be similar since purchased receivables are usually in the late stages of the post charged off collection cycle 
we therefore aggregate most pools purchased within each quarter 
pools purchased before may not be aggregated with other pool purchases 
each static pool  either aggregated or non aggregated  retains its own identity and does not change over the remainder of its life 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for recognition of revenue  principal payments and impairments 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
this review includes an assessment of the actual results of cash collections  the work effort used and expected to be used in future periods  the components of the static pool including type of paper  the average age of purchased receivables  certain demographics and other factors that help us understand how a pool may perform in future periods 
generally  to the extent the differences in actual performance versus expected performance are favorable and the results of the review of pool demographics is also favorable  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
if the review of actual performance results in revised cash flow estimates that are less than the original estimates  and if the results of the review lead us to believe the decline in performance is not temporary  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
these periodic reviews  and any adjustments or impairments  are discussed with our audit committee 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization we periodically review the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether an impairment may exist 
us gaap requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets not subject to amortization be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
if the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount 
table of contents equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value of our goodwill reporting unit  the purchased receivables operating segment  is determined using various valuation techniques including market capitalization and an analysis of discounted cash flows 
at the time of the annual goodwill impairment test  november   market capitalization was substantially higher than book value and goodwill was considered not to be impaired 
however  a decrease in market capitalization would have resulted in book value greater than market capitalization 
as a result of declines in the company s stock price throughout the first nine months of  a discounted cash flow analysis was performed as of september  a discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
the company based assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates on its budget and long term plans 
the company used a discount rate of  which reflected our estimate of cost of equity and our assessment of the risk inherent in the reporting unit 
the fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis exceeded the book value as of september  however  a basis points increase in the discount rate  or a decrease in cash flow of approximately million in each year would result in an excess of book value over fair value and an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
the annual impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization  for example  trademark and trade names  consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using various discounted cash flow valuation methodologies 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of discount rates and future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets and include estimates of the cost of debt and equity for market participants in our industry 
during the third quarter of  we decided to no longer purchase and collect healthcare accounts receivable 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge for the net book value of intangible assets for trademark and trade names associated with the healthcare collection activities of million  which is included in restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we previously performed a discounted cash flow analysis of our trademark and trade names as of september  using a discount rate of and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
we recorded an impairment of s million  which is included in impairment of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be established and charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax 
table of contents liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our credit facilities 
accordingly  we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements for non trading purposes to modify the interest rate exposure associated with our outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates equal to three month libor for fixed rates on the notional amount of million 
every year thereafter  on the anniversary of the swap agreement  the notional amount decreases by million 
the outstanding unhedged borrowings on our credit facilities were million as of december  interest rates on unhedged borrowings may be based on the prime rate or libor  at our discretion 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on the unhedged borrowings  interest expense would have increased approximately million for each of the years ended december   and the swap was determined to be highly effective in hedging against fluctuations in variable interest rates associated with the underlying debt since we entered into the agreement 
interest rates have decreased since we entered into our swap agreement  reducing the fair value and resulting in a liability balance 
additional declines in interest rates will further reduce the fair value  while increasing interest rates will increase the fair value
