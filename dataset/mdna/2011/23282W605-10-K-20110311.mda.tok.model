item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions 
our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton  a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell 
our current research and development programs relating to the biology of muscle function are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of cardiac  skeletal and smooth muscle 
we have  and intend to continue  to leverage our experience in muscle contractility in order to expand our 
table of contents current pipeline into new therapeutic areas  and expect to continue to be able to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development 
our cardiac muscle contractility program is focused on cardiac muscle myosin  a motor protein that powers cardiac muscle contraction 
our lead drug candidate from this program  omecamtiv mecarbil formerly known as ck  is a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator 
we have conducted a clinical development program for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure  comprised of a series of phase i and phase iia clinical trials 
in may  amgen acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil worldwide  except japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
ck is the lead drug candidate from our skeletal sarcomere activator program 
the skeletal muscle sarcomere is the basic unit of skeletal muscle contraction 
ck is currently the subject of a phase iia clinical trials program 
we believe ck may be useful in treating diseases or medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting 
in march  ck received an orphan drug designation from the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known as als or lou gehrig s disease 
we are also advancing a second  structurally distinct  fast skeletal muscle sarcomere activator  ck  in non clinical studies intended to enable the filing of an investigational new drug application ind with the fda in both of these compounds selectively activate the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex  which is a set of regulatory proteins that modulates the contractility of the fast skeletal muscle sarcomere 
in our smooth muscle contractility program  we are conducting non clinical development of compounds that directly inhibit smooth muscle myosin  the motor protein central to the contraction of smooth muscle  causing the relaxation of contracted smooth muscle 
compounds from this program may be useful as potential treatments for diseases and conditions associated with excessive smooth muscle contraction  such as bronchoconstriction associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
earlier research activities at the company were directed to the inhibition of mitotic kinesins  a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the process of cell division  or mitosis 
this research produced three drug candidates that have progressed into clinical testing for the potential treatment of cancer ispinesib  sb and gsk effective february  our strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline gsk relating to our mitotic kinesin inhibitors terminated by mutual agreement 
we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for these drug candidates with third parties 
two of our drug candidates directed to muscle contractility have now demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in patients omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure and ck in patients with als 
our potential drug candidate ck has demonstrated pharmacological activity in non clinical studies 
in  we expect to focus on translating the pharmacodynamic activity observed in these compounds into potentially meaningful clinical benefits for these patients 
muscle contractility programs cardiac muscle contractility our lead drug candidate from this program is omecamtiv mecarbil  a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure  including omecamtiv mecarbil 
in may  amgen exercised its option under this agreement to obtain an exclusive license worldwide  except japan  to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates arising from the collaboration  and subsequently paid us an option exercise fee of million 
as a result  amgen is now responsible for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds  at its expense worldwide  except japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
under the agreement  amgen will reimburse us for agreed research and development activities we perform 
the agreement provides for potential pre commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration  and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of 
table of contents annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement 
the agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co funding phase iii development costs of drug candidates under the collaboration 
if we elect to co fund such costs  we would be entitled to co promote omecamtiv mecarbil in north america and participate in agreed commercialization activities in institutional care settings  at amgen s expense 
we expect omecamtiv mecarbil to be developed as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both as an intravenous formulation for use in the hospital setting and as an oral formulation for use in the outpatient setting 
in september  cytokinetics and amgen announced plans to initiate a phase iib clinical trial of an intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure prior to initiating further clinical trials of oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil 
we anticipate that  in the first half of  amgen will initiate this trial  which will be conducted by amgen in collaboration with cytokinetics 
we and amgen are discussing the development strategy for oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil 
we anticipate that these plans may include studies designed to investigate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil 
we have agreed with amgen upon a research plan focused on joint research activities in that will be directed to potential next generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program 
the clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and the drug is commercialized 
omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur 
we funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to amgen s option exercise in may we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recognized research and development revenue from amgen of million in  consisting of reimbursements of full time employee equivalent fte and other expenses 
we recognized research and development revenue from amgen of million in the  consisting of million for the transfer of our existing inventories of omecamtiv mecarbil and related reference materials to amgen and million for reimbursements of ftes and other costs 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently  or if we elect to co fund later stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen 
skeletal muscle contractility ck is the lead potential drug candidate from this program 
we are also advancing another compound from this program  ck  in non clinical studies intended to enable the filing of an ind in ck and ck are structurally distinct and selective small molecule activators of the fast skeletal sarcomere 
these compounds act on fast skeletal muscle troponin 
activation of troponin increases its sensitivity to calcium  leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility 
each of ck and ck has demonstrated encouraging pharmacological activity in preclinical models and  with respect to ck  in healthy volunteers and als patients 
in a recent phase iia clinical trial of ck in als patients  evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects was observed 
we are evaluating the potential indications for which ck and ck may be useful 
in march  ck received an orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of als 
in july  we were awarded a grant in the amount of million by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke  which is intended to support research and development of ck for the potential treatment of myasthenia gravis for three years 
the grant was awarded under the american recovery and reinvestment act of we recognized 
table of contents revenue of million under this grant arrangement in  which we recorded as research and development  grant and other revenues 
early in  we announced data from two phase i clinical trials evaluating ck in healthy volunteers 
the first trial established a maximum tolerated single dose of ck of mg 
also in this trial  ck produced concentration dependent  statistically significant increases versus placebo in the force developed by the tibialis anterior muscle 
ck was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported 
the second phase i trial was a study of multiple doses of ck at steady state  both the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the ck plasma concentration versus time curve from before dosing until hours after dosing were generally dose proportional 
in general  systemic exposure to ck in this trial was high and inter subject variability was low 
in addition  these multiple dose regimens of ck were well tolerated  and no serious adverse events were reported 
we have initiated three evidence of effect phase iia clinical trials of ck one trial in patients with als  which was completed in december  one ongoing trial in patients with symptoms of claudication associated with peripheral artery disease pad  and one ongoing trial in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis 
our evidence of effect clinical trials are randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  three period cross over studies of single doses of ck intended to translate the mechanism of action of ck  as demonstrated pharmacodynamically in healthy volunteers  to patients with impaired muscle function and potentially to establish statistically significant and clinically relevant evidence of pharmacodynamic effects 
these trials may then form the basis for larger clinical trials designed to demonstrate proof of concept 
in april  we initiated and in december  we completed a phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial of ck in als patients 
patients were enrolled in this trial 
results from this trial were presented in december at the clinical trials session at the st international symposium on als motor neurone diseases 
increases in multiple clinically relevant pharmacodynamic assessments were observed  and the two doses of ck administered mg and mg exhibited dose proportional pharmacokinetics 
the investigators also concluded that these single doses of ck appeared to be safe and generally well tolerated by the patients in this trial 
there were no serious adverse events judged to have been drug related  and most adverse events were classified by the investigators as mild 
most reports of dizziness  the most frequent and most clearly dose related adverse event in the trial  were classified as mild and none were determined to be severe 
we plan to present additional analyses of the data from this trial during a plenary session at the rd annual meeting of the american academy of neurology in april in honolulu  hawaii 
in june  we initiated a phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial of ck in patients with symptoms of claudication associated with pad 
at least and up to patients may be enrolled in this trial 
the dose levels originally administered in this trial were mg and mg 
in october  we conducted an interim review of data from this trial that suggested potential pharmacodynamic activity of ck to increase skeletal muscle performance in these patients 
in addition  this review suggested that single oral doses of ck were generally well tolerated by most patients in this trial 
however  serious adverse events were reported by two patients dizziness and mental confusion in one and dizziness and dyskinesia or abnormal movements in the other 
both patients required inpatient observation until their symptoms resolved 
these events were not life threatening and appeared to resolve spontaneously and completely without any additional treatment 
following these observations  the protocol was amended to lower the mg dose to mg 
we are continuing to conduct this trial and anticipate that data will be available from this trial in the first half of in january  we initiated our third phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial of ck in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis 
at least and up to patients may be enrolled in this trial 
patients receive a single oral doses of placebo or mg or mg of ck the primary objective of this trial is to assess the effects of ck on measures of muscle strength  muscle fatigue and pulmonary function 
the secondary objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate and characterize the relationship  if any  between the doses and plasma concentrations of ck and its pharmacodynamic effects  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ck administered as single doses to patients with myasthenia gravis  and to evaluate the effect of ck on investigator and patient determined global functional assessment and the modified mg symptom score  an assessment combining patient reports and physician evaluations to assess the severity of symptoms due to 
table of contents myasthenia gravis 
we are continuing to conduct this trial  and anticipate that data will be available from this trial by the end of in the first half of  we anticipate initiating a phase i drug drug interaction clinical trial of ck administered orally to healthy volunteers 
this trial is intended to evaluate the effects of ck on the pharmacokinetics of riluzole and other drugs as well as the pharmacokinetics of ck when administered after a meal and when fasting 
in the first half of  we anticipate initiating a phase ii multi dose  safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic clinical trial of ck in als patients 
this trial is expected to evaluate patients receiving daily oral doses of ck for up to days 
the primary objective of this trial will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ck in patients with als 
in addition  patients will be asked to report their als symptoms using the als functional rating scale revised alsfrs r 
patients will also undergo tests of muscle fatigability  certain indices of pulmonary function  and patients and investigators global status assessments 
this phase ii trial may be initiated after we have completed the initial part of the phase i drug drug interaction trial  which will focus on drug drug interaction between riluzole and ck we anticipate that  in the first half of  we will file an ind with the fda to perform a phase i  first time in humans clinical trial ck we also anticipate initiating a first in humans phase i clinical trial of ck in healthy volunteers in the second half of ck and ck are at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance ck  ck or other compounds from this program into and through development 
smooth muscle contractility our smooth muscle contractility program is focused on the discovery and development of small molecule smooth muscle myosin inhibitors which may be useful as potential treatments for diseases and conditions associated with excessive smooth muscle contraction  and leverages our expertise in muscle function and its application to drug discovery 
our inhaled smooth muscle myosin inhibitors have demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of bronchoconstrictive diseases and may have applications for indications such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
our smooth muscle myosin inhibitors  administered orally or intravenously  have also demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of vascular constriction 
we intend to continue to conduct non clinical development of compounds from this program 
in may  a poster summarizing non clinical data regarding our smooth muscle contractility program was presented at the american thoracic society s international conference 
our smooth muscle myosin inhibitors are at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from their commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our smooth muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our smooth muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance compounds from this program into and through development 
mitotic kinesin inhibitors we currently have three drug candidates for the potential treatment of cancer ispinesib  sb and gsk all of these arose from our earlier research activities directed to the role of the cytoskeleton in cell division 
table of contents and were progressed under our strategic alliance with gsk 
this strategic alliance was established in to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics targeting mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
mitotic kinesins are a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the process of cell division  or mitosis 
under this strategic alliance  we focused primarily on two mitotic kinesins kinesin spindle protein ksp and centromere associated protein e cenp e 
inhibition of ksp or cenp e interrupts cancer cell division  causing cell death 
ispinesib and sb are structurally distinct small molecules that specifically inhibit ksp 
gsk specifically inhibits cenp e 
in november  we amended our strategic alliance with gsk and assumed responsibility  at our expense  for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  other than cenp e 
gsk retained an option to resume responsibility for the development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb this option expired at the end of we agreed with gsk to terminate our strategic alliance effective february  we have retained all rights to ispinesib  sb and gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
gsk remains responsible for completing its phase i clinical trial of gsk in cancer patients  at its expense 
following gsk s completion of its phase i clinical trial of gsk  we will be responsible for any further research and development costs associated with gsk each of ispinesib  sb and gsk is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently are responsible for all research and development costs associated with ispinesib and sb we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we received and recognized as revenue  reimbursements from gsk for patent expenses related to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of zero   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have completed the phase i portion of each of the phase i ii clinical trials for ispinesib and sb gsk is completing the current phase i clinical trial of gsk we do not currently intend to conduct any further development of these drug candidates ourselves 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the future development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb and gsk with third parties 
we may not be able to enter into an agreement regarding such a strategic alternative on acceptable terms  if it all 
development risks the successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to decisions made by amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil  the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed  our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms  if at all  including  but not limited to  our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design  management  conduct and funding of clinical trials  delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  including variability in patient response  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates  
table of contents the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility  and possible delays in the characterization  formulation and manufacture of potential drug candidates 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  and other risk factors 
revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years  if at all 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen and gsk for license fees and agreed research activities 
in december  we entered into our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  under which we received an upfront  non refundable  non exclusive license and technology access fee of million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with amgen 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to amgen for net proceeds of million  of which the million purchase premium was recorded as deferred revenue 
through may  we amortized the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium to license revenue ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which was four years 
in june  we recognized as revenue the remaining balance of million of the related deferred revenue when amgen exercised its option  triggering the end of the non exclusive license period 
in june  we received a non refundable option exercise fee from amgen of million  which we recognized in revenue as license fees from a related party 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain pre commercialization and commercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by the achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we have received reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred 
we may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
revenues related to the reimbursement of ftes were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes 
revenues from gsk in were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses  which we recorded as the related expenses were incurred 
gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june in  we received a million milestone payment from gsk relating to its initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized to date are non refundable  even if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in december  gsk s option to license ispinesib and sb expired and all rights to these drug candidates remain with us under the collaboration and license agreement  subject to our royalty obligations to gsk 
we agreed with gsk to terminate this strategic alliance  effective february  we have retained all rights to develop and commercialize ispinesib  sb and gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 

table of contents because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other pre commercialization milestones under our strategic alliance with amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
if one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug  we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to amgen under our strategic alliance and from those licensed to future partners  and from direct sales of our drugs 
we retain a product by product option to co fund certain phase iii development activities under our strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
if we exercise our co promotion rights under this strategic alliance  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with amgen 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for the continued conduct of preclinical studies and non clinical and clinical development for ck  ck and other skeletal sarcomere activators for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  preclinical studies and non clinical development of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with bronchoconstriction  vascular constriction  or both  and our research programs in other disease areas 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb in november  under our amended collaboration and license agreement with gsk  we assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins other than cenp e  at our sole expense 
research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our skeletal muscle contractility program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for other research programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including  but not limited to  finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in restructuring in september  we announced a restructuring plan to realign our workforce and operations in line with a strategic reassessment of our research and development activities and corporate objectives we completed all restructuring activities and recognized all anticipated restructuring charges by december  
table of contents stock compensation the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases for  and in thousands years ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options granted under our stock plans 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  through  we continued to amortize deferred stock based compensation recorded for stock options granted prior to our initial public offering 
the remaining balance became fully amortized in income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we did not record an income tax provision in the year ended december  because we had a net taxable loss in that period 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to alternative minimum tax amt 
however  due to the department of the treasury s further guidance clarifying that utilization of the amt net operating loss nol was not limited to as part of the year nol carryback provision brought about by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  the amt liability was reversed in in addition to the  benefit related to the amt liability  we also recognized a  benefit related to the monetization of the federal research tax credit for a total benefit of approximately  in based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december   and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance increased by million in  decreased by million in  and increased by million in we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently not undergoing any income tax examinations 
in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million before federal benefit at december  if not utilized  the federal and state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in various amounts beginning and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
when utilized  the portion related to stock option deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

table of contents in general  under section of the internal revenue code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income 
our existing net operating losses and tax credits are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code and result in additional limitations 
during the year ended december   we conducted a study and determined that we would not be able to utilize a portion of our federal research credit as a result of such a restriction 
accordingly  we reduced our deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance by million 
as a result  the research credit amount as of december  reflects the restriction on our ability to use the credit 
accounting guidance for income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
it also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the unrecognized tax benefits on our research credits are based on our evaluation of the underlying research expenditures 
we have reduced the respective deferred tax assets and valuation allowance to reflect the unrecognized tax benefits 
these adjustments did not have any impact on the income tax expense 
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties were zero for and we account for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next twelve months 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues increase years ended december  decrease in millions research and development revenues from related parties research and development  grant and other revenues license revenues from related parties total revenues we recorded total revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development revenues from related parties refers to research and development revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen and  through  gsk 
research and development revenues from amgen were million in  million in and zero in research and development revenues of million from amgen in represented reimbursements of fte and out of pocket expenses 
research and development revenues of million from amgen in consisted of million for the transfer of the majority of our existing inventories of omecamtiv mecarbil and related reference materials  and million for fte and out of pocket expense reimbursements 
research and development revenues from gsk were zero   and million in  and  respectively 
research and development revenues from gsk in and consisted of patent expense reimbursements 
in december  gsk s option to license each of ispinesib and sb as provided under the parties collaboration and license agreement expired 
accordingly  we retain all rights to both ispinesib and sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
in december  we and gsk agreed to terminate the 
table of contents collaboration and license agreement  effective february  we have retained all rights to ispinesib  sb  and gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
in july  the national institute of neurological disorders and strokes awarded us a grant to support research and development of ck directed to the potential treatment for myasthenia gravis for a period of up to three years 
we recognized grant revenue of million under this grant arrangement in we are eligible to receive additional funds of up to million through under this grant 
in november  we were notified by the internal revenue service that we would receive total cash grants of million based on our applications for certain investments in qualified therapeutic discovery projects under section d of the internal revenue code 
the grants relate to certain research and development costs we incurred in in connection with our cardiac  skeletal and smooth muscle contractility programs 
we received and recognized as grant revenue million under this grant in license revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliance with amgen 
license revenues were zero  million and million in  and  respectively 
license revenues for consisted of the may million option exercise fee from amgen and the recognition of deferred revenue of the remaining million related to the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium from amgen 
license revenue of million in consisted of amortization of the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium from amgen 
deferred revenue related to the amgen strategic alliance was zero and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferred revenue balance at december  related to amgen s prepayment of fte reimbursements

the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources

auction rate securities ars 
our short term investments at december  included at par value million of ars 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  these ars experienced multiple failed auctions beginning in february  as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result  the ars ceased to be liquid 
the fair values of the ars as of december  were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair value of our investments in ars as of december  was determined to be million 
changes in the fair value of the ars  excluding the sale of ars  were recognized in current period earnings in interest and other  net

the ars rights provided us the right to receive the par value of 
table of contents our ars  ie  the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid interest at any time between june  and july  the enforceability of the ars rights resulted in a put option  which we recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that was accounted for separately from the ars

on june   we exercised the ars rights  requiring that ubs ag purchase our remaining outstanding ars at par value of million 
accordingly  on the settlement date of july   ubs ag deposited the proceeds of million into our money market account 
the investment put option related to the ars rights was extinguished at that time

shelf registration statement

the specific terms of offerings  if any  under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offerings

we plan to continue to support the clinical development of our cardiac muscle myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure and research of potential next generation compounds as part of our strategic alliance with amgen 
we plan to continue clinical development of our fast skeletal troponin activator ck for the potential treatment of diseases and conditions related to skeletal muscle weakness or wasting 
we plan to continue to conduct non clinical development of our fast skeletal troponin activator ck and  following clearance of an ind  clinical development 
we plan to progress one or more of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds through non clinical and clinical development 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our other compounds from our muscle contractility programs through research to candidate selection 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  non clinical development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
table of contents delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds for the potential treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates  the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities  including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  the expansion and advancement of our research programs  the hiring of additional employees and consultants  the expansion of our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investments and interest earned on investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates or of other research and development programs 
alternatively  we might raise funds through strategic relationships  public or private financings or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all  or in accordance with our planned timelines 
furthermore  financing obtained through future strategic relationships may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates 
similarly  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investments available for sale and trading investments 
our investments have consisted of ars  municipal and government agency bonds  commercial paper  us government treasury securities  and money market funds 
we designated all investments  except for our ars held by ubs  as available for sale 
therefore  they are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reclassified our ars held by ubs from available for sale to trading securities 
investments that we designate as trading assets are reported at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
see notes to financial statements note cash equivalents and investments for further detailed discussion 
investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
other than temporary impairment 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
factors considered by management in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred include the nature of the investment  whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment  the financial condition of the investee  the severity and the duration of the impairment  and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
when we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other than temporary decline occurred 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in other income or expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest and other  net 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for agreed research and development activities  may include non refundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair 
table of contents values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are negotiated rates that are based upon our costs  and which we believe approximate fair value 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we evaluate the payments to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
funds received from third parties under grant arrangements are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the grant arrangement as the activities under the grant are part of our development programs 
if we are not the principal participant  the grant funds are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
grant funds received are not refundable and are recognized when the related qualified research and development costs are incurred and when there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received 
funds received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed utilizing third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation we apply the accounting guidance for stock compensation  which establishes the accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
under the guidance for stock compensation for non employees  we measure the fair value of the award each period until the award is fully vested 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates at the time  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of 
table of contents management judgment 
as a result  if conditions change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we did not record an income tax provision in the year ended december  because we had a net taxable loss in that period 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to alternative minimum tax amt 
however  due to the department of the treasury s further guidance clarifying that utilization of the amt net operating loss nol was not limited to as part of the year nol carryback provision brought about by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  the amt liability was reversed in in addition to the  benefit related to the amt liability  we also recognized a  benefit related to the monetization of the federal research tax credit for a total benefit of approximately  in based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december   and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance increased by million in  decreased by million in  and increased by million in we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently not undergoing any income tax examinations 
in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties were zero for and we account for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of 
table of contents us interest rates 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest the majority of our excess cash in us treasuries and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure in any one issuer and investment class  with the exception of obligations of the us treasury and federal agencies  for which there are no such limits 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by attempting to limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us bonds and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short and long term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our equipment financing lines and investment portfolio dollars in thousands fair value at december  beyond total assets investments average interest rate liabilities equipment financing lines average interest rate
