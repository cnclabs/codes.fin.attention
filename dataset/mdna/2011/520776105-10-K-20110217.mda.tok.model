item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview in  the economy improved modestly from the global recession that affected previous periods  particularly in the latter half of the year 
sales from continuing operations increased by during compared to versus a decline of in from during this period  many of our customers reduced their inventories  suspended purchases of industrial supplies and downgraded the quality of product purchased due to the overall deterioration of the economy 
additionally  the contraction in the credit market made it difficult for many of our customers to finance purchases or expand their businesses 
we continue to review our strategic alternatives with a focus on our ability to meet customer demands in the current competitive environment 
as a result  we developed a comprehensive plan focused on driving sales and improving our operating margins 
during and  we began transforming our current platform and infrastructure by executing on the following three initiatives to improve our core mro business restructuring our sales organization  optimizing our distribution network and replacing our legacy information systems with a best in class erp system 
we dedicated a number of internal resources and made investments in these initiatives as we believe they will position us to better serve our existing customers and grow the organization in the future 
we believe this is the right long term strategy and  in  we began to realize early benefits from these initiatives  including sales agent productivity improvements and reduced distribution expenses 
we are taking action to improve our current sales agent model while attempting to retain its advantages 
during  we completed the conversion of district sales managers into full time employees who are now able to concentrate their efforts on managing their respective territories and increasing sales productivity 
we also continued to streamline our cost structure including efficiencies in our distribution center network while maintaining high service levels to our customers 
during  we closed two distribution centers to better align our supply chain with our customer base and eliminate redundancies within our distribution network allowing us to realize cost savings throughout along with these savings  the company also implemented comprehensive cost control measures throughout the organization 
additionally  we have performed a comprehensive review of our existing information systems and have selected a new erp solution that is planned for implementation in a phased approach throughout these initiatives  which are described in item business  will require additional effort and investment over the next few years  but should lead to a much more efficient  responsive and profitable organization in the future 
these efforts  contributed to our improved operating income of million in from million in in  we sold substantially all of the assets of acs and rutland in two separate transactions for an aggregate sales price of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
these proceeds should allow us to re invest in our core mro business to drive internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we continue to evaluate alternatives regarding our remaining oem operation  automatic screw machine products 
in addition to the cash received from the sale of the acs and rutland assets  we generated million of cash from operations prior to making our last payment obligation under the dpa settlement agreement of million 
we ended the year with million of cash and no outstanding borrowings 
we shared these strong cash flows with our stockholders by increasing our quarterly dividend in to per share

we have a credit agreement with the privatebank and trust company credit agreement

the applicable interest rate margins for borrowings are based on the company s debt to ebitda ratio and range from libor plus to or prime minus 
to zero percent 
the credit agreement is secured by cash  accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit and million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability at million 
the credit agreement limits our annual dividend distribution to million and  in addition to other customary representations  warranties and covenants  it requires us to comply with the following financial covenants  as defined in the credit agreement 
on december  we were in compliance with all covenants as detailed below covenant requirement actual minimum ebitda  as defined in the amended credit agreement million million cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to debt ratio minimum tangible net worth million million debt service ratio we believe that cash provided by operations and the million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  strategic initiatives and capital improvements for the upcoming fiscal year

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had future minimum operating lease commitments of million  principally for facilities and equipment 
we also had contractual commitments to purchase million of product from our suppliers in critical accounting policies we have disclosed our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be revised by a material amount 
at december   our allowance reserve was of our gross accounts receivables outstanding 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our annual doubtful accounts expense by approximately million 
inventory reserves inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
most of our products are not exposed to the risk of obsolescence due to technology changes 
however  some of our products do have a limited shelf life  and from time to time we add and remove items from our catalogs  brochures or website for marketing and other purposes 
in addition  we carry varying levels of customer specific inventory 
to reduce our inventory to a lower of cost or market value  we record a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and monitoring current inventory activity 
we use estimates to determine the necessity of recording these reserves based on periodic detailed analysis reviews using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
as part of this analysis  we consider several factors including the inventories length of time on hand  historical sales  product shelf life  product life cycle  product classification  and product obsolescence 
in general  depending on product classification  we reserve inventory with low turnover at higher rates than inventory with high turnover 
our policy is to not re value inventory to the original cost basis subsequent to establishing a new cost basis 

table of contents at december   our inventory reserve was million  equal to approximately of our total inventory 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our cost of goods sold by million 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  the impact of tax planning strategies and the ability to carry back deferred tax assets to offset prior taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 
the company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when a benefit is more likely than not ie  greater than likely to be sustained on its technical merits 
recognized tax benefits are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained  based on cumulative probability  in final settlement of the position 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
goodwill impairment goodwill  all of which is included in our mro segment  is tested annually during the fourth quarter  or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
first the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  and thus  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we estimate the fair value of the mro segment using a market approach  which relies on the market value of companies that are engaged in the same line of business 
we also prepare a discounted cash flow dcf analysis based on our operating plan to determine a range of fair values 
the dcf model relies on a number of assumptions that have a significant affect on the resulting fair value calculation and may change in future periods 
estimated future cash flows are affected both by future economic conditions outside the control of management and operating results directly related to management s execution of our business strategy 
our dcf model is also affected by our estimate of a discount rate that is consistent with the weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 
we then assess the reasonableness of our estimate of the fair value of the mro segment 
this is done by applying the same valuation methodology and estimates described above to the entire company and reconciling the resulting estimated fair value of the consolidated company to its market capitalization based on the trading range of the company s stock near the measurement date 
currently  the calculated fair value of the mro segment exceeds its carrying value by over million using our most conservative estimate and  therefore  is not considered impaired 
changes in the assumptions used in our dcf calculation could have a material affect on the fair value estimate and could change our assessment of impairment 
a hypothetical decrease in the estimated future annual cash flows generated by the mro segment would decrease its estimated fair value by approximately million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease its estimated fair value by approximately million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of our subsidiaries is located and operates in canada using the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
operating results are translated into us dollars when consolidated into our financial statements 
therefore  we are exposed to market risk relating to the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign currency exchange rate would have affected our net sales by million and net assets by million 
certain compensation awards have been granted to our directors  officers and key employees that are payable in cash  based upon the market price of our common stock 
these awards are re measured each reporting period and the effect of the change in the share price is reflected in our operating results 
a hypothetical change in the price of our common stock on december  would have affected our operating income by million 
a number of our current and past employees have opted to defer a portion of their earned compensation to be paid at a future date 
these individuals have the ability to invest the funds in one or more portfolios that track the performance of various mutual funds 
as of december   we recorded a million liability equal to the market value amount of the funds owed 
additionally  we have invested funds in life insurance policies on certain executives 
the cash surrender value of the policies is invested in various investment instruments and the million market value of these investment instruments has been recorded as an asset on our financial statements as of december  the change in the market value of the funds supporting our deferred compensation plan and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is recorded as a component of income and a hypothetical increase or decrease in the investment portfolios of both the cash value of life insurance asset and the deferred compensation liability would have affected our operating income by million 
we are exposed to market risk relating to increased commodity and energy costs affecting the production costs of our vendors 
these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us and if we are unable to fully pass these costs through to our customers or to modify our activities  the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating profit margins 
on december   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
however  in future years  operating results may be exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the variable interest rate charged on our revolving line of credit
