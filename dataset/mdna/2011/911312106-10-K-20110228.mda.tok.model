growth in world trade  us industrial production and retail sales positively impacted volume in our package delivery  ltl and forwarding operations in additionally  cost containment initiatives and better network efficiencies resulted in improving operating profit margins for our small package operations 
our consolidated results are presented in the table below year ended december  change revenue in millions operating expenses in millions operating profit in millions operating margin average daily package volume in thousands average revenue per piece net income in millions basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share items affecting comparability the year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items in millions year ended december  operating expenses restructuring charge gain on sales of businesses gain on sale of real estate aircraft impairment charge goodwill impairment charge intangible impairment charge interest expense currency remeasurement charge income tax expense benefit from the items above charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary restructuring charge in  we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment  and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization 
this pre tax charge totaled million million after tax  and reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits  severance benefits and unvested stock compensation 

table of contents gain on sales of businesses in  we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain freight segment  and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax 
also in  we sold a specialized transportation business in germany within our supply chain freight segment  and incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of million million after tax  which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale 
gain on sale of real estate in  we recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment 
aircraft impairment charges in  we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft fleet  and recorded an impairment charge of million  which affected our us domestic package segment 
this charge  as well as our accounting policies pertaining to long lived assets  is discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates 
goodwill impairment charge in  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this charge  as well as our accounting policies pertaining to goodwill  is discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates 
intangible impairment charge in  we completed an impairment assessment on a customer list intangible asset related to our domestic package entity in the united kingdom 
we recorded a million charge related to this assessment  which is further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates

charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary in  we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction 
as a result of this change in tax status  we recorded a non cash charge of million to income tax expense  which resulted primarily from the write off of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status 
results of operations segment review the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments 
we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain non gaap financial measures  including operating profit  operating margin  pre tax income  net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable items discussed previously 
we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for

among our air products  package volume increased as inventory rebuilding in the manufacturing and retailing sectors contributed to growth 
however  our letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries 
the growth in ground volume was driven by increased volume from the manufacturing and retailing sectors 
compared to in  our overall volume declined as decreases in industrial production and retail sales reduced overall demand in the us small package market 
our air product volume was stronger than our ground volume  as our air volume benefited from market share gains resulting from the departure of a competitor in the us market  as well as improving economic trends in the latter half of the year 
the growth in air volume was strongest in our less time sensitive products  such as next day air saver and three day select 

table of contents volume trends improved in the fourth quarter  largely as a result of overall economic improvements  as average daily volume for next day air and deferred products increased and  respectively  over levels 
ground volume demonstrated an improving trend over the previous quarters despite a decline in the fourth quarter compared with revenue per piece compared to overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products in  largely due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes  which are discussed further below 
the revenue per piece for our air products also improved as a result of higher average package weights and the overall mix shift from letters to packages 
for both our air and ground products  revenue per piece was negatively affected by a shift in product mix to our less premium services  such as next day air saver and ground basic 
revenue per piece for our ground and air products was impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 
compared to revenue per piece for our air products was negatively affected in by a decline in the fuel surcharge rate for air products 
additionally  the revenue per piece decline for our air products was impacted by lower average package weights and a mix shift toward lower yielding products  reflecting the economic recession in the united states 
the decline in revenue per piece for our ground products was primarily due to a decrease in the fuel surcharge rate  but was also impacted by lower average package weights 
the factors decreasing revenue per piece for our ground and air products were partially offset by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
the trend towards lower package weights began to stabilize in the fourth quarter  however product mix within our air and ground services continued to adversely impact revenue per piece  as the lower yielding products within those categories represented a larger share of our overall package volume 
fuel surcharges ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services 
the air fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel  while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows year ended december  point change next day air deferred ground on january  and january   we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by in each of the two years 
the increase and decrease in the air and ground fuel surcharges are due to the significant variations in jet and diesel fuel prices in addition to the reduction in the index on the air surcharge 
total domestic fuel surcharge revenue  net of the impact of hedging  increased by million in  primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates described above  as 
table of contents well as the increase in volume for our air and ground products 
in  fuel surcharge revenue decreased by billion due to lower fuel surcharge rates and the decline in volume for our air and ground products 
operating profit and margin compared to operating profit in was positively impacted by the overall economic growth in the us  which drove increased volume and yields 
combined with increased network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives  this resulted in strong operating leverage 
network efficiencies were achieved in  as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels  and utilized our expanded worldport facility to utilize larger aircraft as well as increase package sorting efficiency 
these changes have resulted in cost savings through fewer aircraft block hours  labor hours in our operations  and vehicle miles driven 
improved pick up and delivery densities have also increased productivity in our operations 
in addition to these factors  management salary costs declined as a result of a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 
the combination of these factors led to an increase in the operating margin in compared with compared to operating profit in was adversely impacted by the us economic recession  decreased network efficiencies due to the decline in volume  changes in package characteristics  and a shift in product mix away from our premium services 
operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense 
we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match these lower volume levels  as well as reduced labor hours and employee headcount  resulting in cost savings 
operating profit trends improved during the fourth quarter of due to both improving volume trends and the positive impact of continued cost and production efficiencies  which combined to improve the operating margin to for the quarter

us origin export volume also had solid growth during the year 
our premium worldwide express and expedited products grew at a relatively faster rate than our standard transborder and trade direct products 
non us domestic volume increased for the year  due in part to the acquisition of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as unsped in turkey in the third quarter of excluding the acquisition of unsped  non us domestic volume increased  led by the strength in core european markets  canada and mexico 
compared to export volume declined  primarily due to weakness in the asia  europe and us export lanes  as the worldwide economic recession and slowdown in world trade more than offset market share gains 
transborder export volume was relatively stronger within the european union and north america trade areas  while volume in the longer export trade lanes was comparatively weaker 
non us domestic volume increased for the year  largely due to the acquisition of unsped  as well as volume growth in germany  france  poland and canada 
by the fourth quarter of  export volume began to improve as global trade and economic activity accelerated 
the asia and us export lanes demonstrated significant improvement  as those trade areas suffered a relatively greater decline in the early part of the year 
domestic volume continued to benefit from the unsped acquisition  as well as market share gains and general economic improvement in europe and the americas 
volume was relatively stronger in the small and middle market customer segments 
revenue per piece compared to export revenue per piece increased during  largely due to higher fuel surcharge rates  base rate increases and product mix 
export revenue per piece increased as higher yielding products such as worldwide express and worldwide expedited grew at a relatively faster pace

export revenue per piece showed a significant improvement in the fourth quarter  as higher yielding trade lanes  such as asia to europe and asia to north america  comprised a larger proportion of our total export volume 
revenue per piece in the fourth quarter benefited from a weaker us dollar  but continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates 
fuel surcharges on january  and january   we modified the fuel surcharge on certain us related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by in each of the two years 
the fuel surcharges for products originating outside the united states continue to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions  depending upon where the shipment takes place 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by million in  due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 
fuel surcharge revenue decreased by million in  due to lower fuel surcharge rates caused by decreased fuel prices  but this was partially offset by an increase in international air volume 
operating profit and margin compared to the increase in operating profit for was primarily driven by volume increases in all major regions and trade lanes worldwide 
the shift in product mix to our higher margin premium services also contributed to the increase in operating profits 
additionally  network efficiencies and cost containment initiatives created operating leverage throughout our operations 
these factors led to an increase in the operating margin in compared with compared to the decline in operating profit for the year was caused primarily by a shift in product mix away from our premium services  and volume declines in some of the longer export trade lanes 
operating profit was also negatively impacted as we incurred a larger decline in fuel surcharge revenue compared with the decline in fuel expense 
to reduce costs  we adjusted our air network and reduced block hours and flight segments in certain international regions

revenue compared to forwarding and logistics revenue increased in  primarily due to growth in the demand for forwarding as a result of the continued expansion of the worldwide economy  inventory rebuilding and world trade 
in our forwarding business  both air freight and ocean freight experienced solid revenue growth  due primarily to higher volumes  fuel surcharges  and other accessorial charges 
international air freight tonnage increased for compared with the prior year 
in our logistics products  we experienced growth in mail services and distribution revenue  with solid increases being achieved in the healthcare and technology sectors 
freight revenue increased  primarily due to higher fuel surcharge rates and a base rate increase that took effect in january average ltl shipments per day  weight per shipment and ltl revenue per hundredweight all increased during the year  largely due to our strategy of maintaining our focus on yields and targeting certain customer segments 
the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to an increase in base prices that took effect in january  as ups freight increased minimum charge  ltl and tl rates an average of  covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada  and mexico 
an additional rate increase took effect october  additionally  ltl revenue per hundredweight increased as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue increased million for the year primarily resulting from higher diesel fuel prices 

table of contents the other businesses within supply chain freight experienced an increase in revenue 
a primary driver of this increase was our ups customer solutions business  which provides a range of services eg project management  industrial engineering  transportation fleet services  distribution network analysis  package engineering  and package visibility 
compared to forwarding and logistics revenue decreased for the year  and was caused primarily by weakness in demand for freight forwarding due to global economic weakness and declines in international trade 
forwarding revenue declined in all major transportation modes  including domestic and international air freight and ocean freight  and was impacted by lower volumes  lower fuel surcharges  and lower security and other accessorial charges 
logistics distribution and post sales service revenue also declined  primarily resulting from the weak global economy  however mail services revenue increased for the year 
freight revenue declined  primarily due to lower fuel surcharge rates and a decline in average daily ltl shipments 
total ltl weight per shipment declined for the year  reflecting the weak ltl market and the ongoing economic recession in the united states in average ltl shipments per day also declined  as market share gains were more than offset by the impact of the weak economy 
ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased  primarily as a result of the lower fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue declined million for the year primarily resulting from lower diesel fuel prices 
however  this decline was partially offset by an increase in base prices that took effect on january   as ups freight increased minimum charge  ltl and tl rates an average of  covering non contractual shipments in the united states and canada 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business and our financial business  experienced a decline in revenue  primarily caused by lower interest rates and decreased loan volume in our financial business 
revenue trends for our forwarding  logistics  and ltl products improved in the fourth quarter of  largely resulting from favorable comparisons with the prior year 
the change in revenue for our forwarding and logistics businesses benefited from the weaker us dollar during the quarter  while revenue in the forwarding and ltl units continued to be adversely impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue 
operating profit and margin compared to operating profit in the forwarding unit increased during  largely due to a strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses  but was partially offset by capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner  resulting in a negative impact to our operating profit and margin 
this situation improved during the second half of  as capacity constraints lessened and we were able to implement revenue management plans which better matched customer pricing with market conditions 
our logistics unit had a solid increase in profitability for the year  which was driven primarily by an expansion of operating margins due to operating efficiencies and a focus on higher margin industry sectors 
operating profit for our ups freight unit increased in compared with the prior year  largely due to better productivity  and increases in base pricing and volume 
productivity metrics increased  including increases in pickup and delivery stops per hour and linehaul utilization 
all of the remaining businesses within this segment had an operating profit during the year 
combined operating profit for these businesses was lower in than in  primarily due to the gain on sale of substantially all our international mail boxes etc 
operations during the second quarter of 
table of contents compared to the lower operating profit in the forwarding unit was impacted by the weak global demand for forwarding services  as well as capacity reductions by outside ocean and air freight carriers 
during the latter half of and particularly in the fourth quarter  capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers  resulting in a negative impact to operating profit and margin 
the operating profit for our logistics unit declined slightly  and was impacted by the loss incurred on the sale of some non core european logistics operations 
however  the operating margin in this business remained stable  as costs were reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues 
our ups freight unit reported improved profitability for  due to a reduction in vacation accruals resulting from modifications in vacation policies and changes in the workforce coverage of our individual plans 
excluding this reduction in vacation liabilities  the ups freight unit reported a small operating loss due to the economic recession and difficult ltl market in the united states 
the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased during the year

payroll costs increased  largely due to higher accruals for management incentive compensation plans resulting from improved company financial results 
union payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in union labor hours  as well as a reduction in management salary costs resulting from a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 

table of contents benefits expense increased in  due largely to increases in pension expense  health and welfare expense  and relocation related benefit costs for management employees 
pension expense increases resulted primarily from higher union contribution rates for multi employer pension plans 
the relocation benefit costs relate to the restructuring of our domestic package operations that occurred in the first quarter of this increase in health and welfare costs  which was primarily driven by health cost inflation  was somewhat mitigated by reductions in the total number of management employees and union employees covered by ups sponsored health and welfare benefit plans 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense during compared with was impacted by several items 
a large component of this decrease was related to employee payroll costs  as union labor hours declined as a result of lower us domestic package volume  and management payroll declined as a result of a reduction in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with a wage freeze 
benefits expense increased due to higher employee health and welfare program costs  which were impacted by higher union contribution rates  and increased pension expense 
pension expense increases resulted from higher union contribution rates for multi employer pension plans  combined with increased interest costs  a decrease in our expected return on plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses for company sponsored plans 
the interest cost grew due to continued service accruals  while the decrease in expected return on plan assets and the actuarial losses were primarily due to the negative asset returns experienced in the overall increase in benefits expense was partially offset by a freeze in the company contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan 
repairs and maintenance repairs and maintenance expense increased in  largely due to higher costs for maintenance on our vehicle fleet 
repairs and maintenance expense declined in  largely due to reduced vehicle maintenance expenses resulting from a reduction in miles driven 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased in  primarily as a result of depreciation expense on equipment and facilities capitalized in conjunction with the recent worldport expansion 
amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of new intangibles recognized related to the unsped acquisition in turkey in the third quarter of  as well as corporate sponsorships entered into in depreciation and amortization expense decreased in  primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense on equipment and facilities  as certain worldport assets became fully depreciated  as well as lower software amortization resulting from fewer new capitalized software projects 
these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles  resulting from new deliveries in and purchased transportation the increase in purchased transportation in was driven by higher freight forwarding volume and rates in asia and europe  as well as increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers as a result of higher fuel prices 
the decrease in purchased transportation in was driven by a combination of lower volume in our international package and forwarding businesses  a stronger us dollar  and decreased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers as a result of lower fuel prices 
fuel the increase in fuel expense in was caused primarily by higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  as well as a slight increase in usage of these products in our operations 
the decrease in fuel expense in was impacted by significantly lower prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  as well as lower usage of these products in our operations 

table of contents other occupancy the decrease in other occupancy expense in was primarily due to decreased labor and overhead expenses  and lower rent expense on leased facilities 
the decrease in other occupancy expense in was primarily caused by lower electricity and natural gas costs  as well as lower rent expense 
other expenses the decrease in other expenses in was largely due to reductions in bad debt expense and foreign currency transaction expense  which reflected gains during compared to losses in additionally  we incurred a loss on the sale of a french repair business in additional expense reductions in were due to cost containment programs  including reductions in telecom costs  office supplies  and outside professional fees 
we also incurred lower expenses associated with auto liability insurance and customer claims for lost or damaged packages 
the decline in other expenses in  exclusive of impairment charges  was due in part to certain variable costs that declined as a result of lower package volume  such as the expense associated with customer claims for lost or damaged packages  rent expense for transportation equipment  cargo handling costs  and aircraft landing fees 
additionally  certain other costs declined primarily as a result of cost containment programs  such as employee expense reimbursements  office supplies  professional services  and advertising costs 
investment income and interest expense year ended december  change investment income and interest expense in millions investment income interest expense impact of currency remeasurement charge adjusted interest expense investment income the decrease in investment income in was primarily due to a lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states  as well as higher impairment losses on our holdings of auction rate and preferred securities 
the decline was largely due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  a significantly lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states  and a loss on the fair value adjustments of certain investment partnerships 
during the second quarter of  we recorded impairment losses on certain asset backed auction rate securities 
the impairment charge resulted from provisions that allow the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newly issued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value 
these securities  which had a cost basis of million  were written down to their fair value of million as of june   resulting in an other than temporary impairment of million 
during the second quarter of  we recorded impairment losses on certain perpetual preferred securities  and an auction rate security collateralized by preferred securities  issued by large financial institutions 
the 
table of contents impairment charge resulted from conversion offers from the issuers of these securities at prices well below the stated redemption value of the preferred shares 
these securities  which had a cost basis of million  were written down to their fair value of million as of june   resulting in an other than temporary impairment of million 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to lower average debt balances  but this was partially offset by lower capitalized interest  due to the recent completion of several large construction projects  including our worldport expansion 
excluding the currency remeasurement charge  the decrease in interest expense was largely due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps

compared to income tax expense declined primarily due to lower pre tax income 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges described previously  which were not deductible for tax purposes and resulted in the effective tax rate increasing by 
this was partially offset by an increase in our first quarter income tax provision as a result of providing a valuation allowance of million against certain deferred tax assets in our international package business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the to time period 
in  operating cash flow was reduced by billion in discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans  as well as an increase in working capital needs due to underlying growth in our business 
in  operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the decline in profitability for our three reporting segments 
in  operating cash flow increased by approximately billion due to tax refunds received that year related to our previous withdrawal from the central states pension plan

except for the billion discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans in  contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 
the remaining increases in contributions in and were largely due to minimum funding requirements related to the ups ibt pension plan 
as discussed further in the contractual commitments section  we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years  primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan 
in january  we made a billion contribution to the ups ibt pension plan  which represented an acceleration of contributions that would have been required in and over million in contributions that would not have been required until after investing activities our primary uses of cash flows for investing activities were for capital expenditures  as follows amounts in millions net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology capital expenditures as a of revenue other investing activities proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment net increase decrease in finance receivables net purchases sales of marketable securities other investing activities

we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
in  we reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our current anticipated operating needs 
future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors  including economic and industry conditions 
the decline in capital expenditures on buildings and facilities primarily resulted from the completion of several large hub construction and expansion projects  including our worldport hub expansion  as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe  canada and china 
in  we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion  which increased the sorting capacity by 
the final phase of the worldport expansion was completed in  with an additional sorting capacity of approximately 
in  we opened our new international air hub in shanghai  china  and also began construction of our new intra asia air hub in shenzhen  china  which became operational in february capital spending on aircraft over the to period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing and  and md aircraft 
capital spending on vehicles was primarily for replacement assets in our package delivery and ltl operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately billion  or approximately of revenue 
future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors  including economic and industry conditions 
the increase in proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment is largely due to real estate sales and the proceeds from insurance recoveries in the net change in finance receivables is primarily due to customer paydowns and new loan origination activity  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending and leasing portfolios 
the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs  and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 
other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs  the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing and boeing aircraft orders  and changes in restricted cash balances 
we maintain an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self insurance obligations  and we deposited and million in cash collateral with the insurance carrier under this agreement during and  respectively

share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases  open market purchases  or other such methods as we deem appropriate 
the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions 
as a result of the uncertain economic environment in and  we slowed our share repurchase activity  and repurchased shares at a rate that approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs 
unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board  the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program 
as of december   we had billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining 
in  we anticipate increasing our share repurchase activity to approximately billion 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
in  the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration  as in past years this dividend was payable the following january 
as a result  a total of five dividend payments were made in in february  we increased our quarterly dividend payment from to per share  an increase 
in   and  we completed senior fixed rate note offerings of   and billion  respectively 
these note offerings were used for various purposes  including discretionary contributions to ups sponsored pension plans  the retirement of existing debt instruments  and the refinancing of commercial paper that was used to fund our withdrawal from the central states pension plan 

table of contents other than commercial paper  repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations  redemption of facilities bonds and the ups notes program  and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in the cash outflows in other financing activities is largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations  as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances 
in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in  and  we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings  which resulted in cash inflows outflows of  and million  respectively 
sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding  with an average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity of days 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding in is expected to fluctuate 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies  however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at day libor plus a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd 
for our year credit default swap spread  subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s 
if our public debt ratings are a a or above  the minimum applicable margin is and the maximum applicable margin is  if our public debt ratings are lower than a a  the minimum applicable margin is and the maximum applicable margin is 
the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under this facility would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  we have satisfied these financial covenants 
these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur  and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions  to of net tangible assets 
as of december   of net tangible assets is equivalent to billion  however we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding 
additionally  we are required to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  of billion on a quarterly basis 
as of december   our net worth  as defined  was equivalent to billion 
we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases  operating leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  and certain other liabilities 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions commitment type after total capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
for debt denominated in a foreign currency  the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
as of december   we have firm commitments to purchase boeing er freighters to be delivered between and  and two boeing f aircraft scheduled for delivery during these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified pension plans 
these contributions include those to the ups ibt pension plan  which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters  as well as the ups pension plan 
these plans are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns  and other assumptions appropriate for these plans 
to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
additionally  we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond  because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 
we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan 
the amount of any minimum funding requirement  as applicable  for these plans could change significantly in future periods  depending on many factors  including future plan asset returns and discount rates 
a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets  and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns  could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements 
such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 
the contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of liabilities for 
table of contents uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances  and as of december   we had million of surety bonds written 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future 
contingencies we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws 
in one of these cases  marlo v 
ups  which was certified as a class action in a california federal court in september  plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime  and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods  and interest and attorneys fees 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of  full time supervisors 
in august  the court granted summary judgment in favor of ups on all claims  and plaintiffs appealed the ruling 
in october  the appeals court reversed the lower court s ruling 
in april  the court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for that month 
after decertification  some plaintiffs filed individual lawsuits raising the same allegations as in the underlying class action 
these individual lawsuits are in various stages 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc  inc are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate mail boxes etc 
centers and the ups store locations 
these lawsuits relate to the rebranding of mail boxes etc 
centers to the ups store  the ups store business model  the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of the ups store franchises  and ups s sale of services in the franchisees territories 
in one of the actions  which is pending in california state court  the court certified a class consisting of all mail boxes etc 
branded stores that rebranded to the ups store in march we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in barber auto sales v 
ups  which a federal court in alabama certified as a class action in september  the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from ups s assessment of shipping charge corrections when ups determines that the dimensional weight of packages is greater than reported by the shipper 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in afms llc v 
ups and fedex corporation  a lawsuit filed in federal court in the central district of california in august  the plaintiff asserts that ups and fedex violated us antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third party negotiators retained by shippers and or to monopolize a so called market for 
table of contents the time sensitive delivery of letters and packages 
the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has informed us that it has opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third party negotiators 
we are cooperating with this investigation 
we deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  most us state and local jurisdictions  and many non us jurisdictions 
we have substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to during the fourth quarter of  we received a refund of million as a result of the resolution of tax years through with the internal revenue service irs appeals office 
along with the audit for tax years through  the irs is currently examining non income based taxes  including employment and excise taxes  which could lead to proposed assessments 
the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time  and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment 
we anticipate receipt of the irs reports on these matters by the end of the second quarter of we have filed all required us state and local returns reporting the result of the resolution of the us federal income tax audit of the tax years and a limited number of us state and local matters are the subject of ongoing audits  administrative appeals or litigation 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa  which becomes amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which became amendable in november we began formal negotiations with teamsters local in october  and have been under the guidance of the national mediation board since january in january  we reached a tentative agreement with teamsters local which will run through november  when ratified 
in addition  the majority approximately  of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam 
our agreement with the iam runs through july  we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 
in january  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging price fixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services 
ups was not named in this case 
on july   the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants 
ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the defendants named in the amended complaint 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents other matters we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj regarding the doj s investigation into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december in october  june  and february  we received information requests from the european commission commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry  and subsequently responded to each request 
on february   ups received a statement of objections by the commission 
this document contains the commission s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by freight forwarders  including ups 
although it alleges anticompetitive behavior  it does not prejudge the commission s final decision  as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts 
the options available to the commission include taking no action or imposing a monetary fine  the range of any potential action by the commission is not reasonably estimable 
any decision imposing a fine would be subject to appeal 
ups has responded to the statement of objections  including at a july commission hearing  and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding 
we received an additional information request from the commission in january  and will respond in due course 
in august  competition authorities in brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry 
approximately freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding  including ups  ups scs transportes brasil sa  and a former employee in brazil 
ups will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations 
we also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions 
we are cooperating with each of these investigations  and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether any such liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
health care legislation the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of in will bring significant changes to the us health care system 
the legislation eliminated the tax deductibility of medicare part d subsidies for retiree prescription drug coverage  however  this impact was not material to our financial results 
we are evaluating the long term impacts of this legislation on us 
it is difficult to estimate the impact due to the nature of our workforce  the various years in which certain provisions become applicable  and the fact that additional regulatory and rulemaking actions will be occurring 
our current estimate is that we will incur an additional to million of annual expense beginning in associated with active employee healthcare coverage  which is primarily due to the multiple coverage provisions of the legislation which require the expansion of dependent coverage to age  among other requirements 
the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the postretirement medical plans increased by million due to the excise tax associated with the legislation 
rate adjustments in october  we announced that an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect january  ups ground service rates increased a net through a combination of a increase in rates and a reduction in the index used to determine the ground fuel surcharge 
ups next day air  ups nd day air  ups day select  and international air shipments originating in the united states including worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased a net  through a combination of a increase in base rates and a reduction in the index used to determine the air fuel surcharge 
these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 

table of contents also in october  we announced a general rate increase for our ups freight ltl unit  which took effect october  the increase covers non contractual shipments in the us  canada and mexico  and applies to minimum charge  ltl rates and accessorial charges 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards provisions within the following accounting standards were adopted during the years covered by these financial statements financial instruments the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance in february that gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates  such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  this guidance allowed for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
we adopted this standard on january   and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method 
accordingly  we recorded a million reduction to retained earnings as of january  these investments are reported in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
compensation retirement benefits we previously utilized the early measurement date option available in accounting for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans  and we measured the funded status of our plans as of september each year 
under guidance issued by the fasb  we were required to use a december measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in as a result of this change in measurement date  we recorded a cumulative effect after tax million reduction to retained earnings as of january  beginning in  new guidance was adopted that required disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  investment policies and strategies  major categories of plan assets  inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
these disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements and disclosures the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements that took effect on january  and are presented in notes     and to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we implemented the previously deferred provisions of this guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the accounting requirements for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased  and for identifying transactions that are not orderly  contained the fasb s guidance were adopted on april   but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
derivatives and hedging the fasb issued certain disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging transactions that took effect on january  and are presented in note 
table of contents business combinations the fasb issued new accounting requirements for business combinations  which took effect on january  this new guidance was applied to business combinations completed in  but had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
consolidation the fasb issued accounting and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests  which took effect on january   however this new guidance had an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
accounting standards issued but not yet effective accounting guidance issued  but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that are probable and estimable  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill and intangible impairment we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding logistics  ups freight  mbe ups store  and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october st for each 
table of contents reporting unit 
the impairment test involves a two step process 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values  including goodwill  is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model dcf model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations  or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
if impairment indicators are present in future periods  the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this impairment charge resulted from several factors  including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector  and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants 
at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation  ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger 
we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance  as well as expand service offerings 
however  this process took longer than initially anticipated  and thus financial results had been below our expectations 
additionally  the ltl sector in had been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us  lower industrial production and retail sales  volatile fuel prices  and significant levels of price based competition 
by the fourth quarter of  the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit  leading to the goodwill impairment charge 
none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in  nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in or changes in our forecasts could cause book values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods  potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite lived intangibles  and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible 
if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on a dcf model 
as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations  we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity 
based on prior performance and near term projections  the value assigned to the customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired 
this impairment was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with the acquired business 
accordingly  an intangible asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in  nor were any such impairments recognized in or 
table of contents self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
fair value measurements in the normal course of business  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk  including derivatives  marketable securities  finance receivables  other investments  and debt 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value  principally derivatives  marketable securities  pension assets  and certain other investments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
pension and postretirement medical benefits as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain several single employer defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  compensation increase rates  expected returns on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable  and represent our best estimates  based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a 
table of contents basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would have resulted in the following increases decreases on the company s reported costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation our pension expense will be higher than our expense due primarily to two negative factors the decline in discount rate used to determine expense from for to for  and the required amortization of unrecognized losses  the majority of which relate to asset losses  outside of the corridor we utilize for accounting purposes 
these negative factors are partially offset by the additional discretionary contributions that we made in and that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our 
table of contents projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
in  we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl s express  deferred and international package volume within the united states  as well as air transportation services between the united states  canada and mexico 
in early april  ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services 
additionally  our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services 
as a result of these factors  the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 
based on the factors noted above  as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures  we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc and dc aircraft fleets 
we conducted an impairment analysis as of march   and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft 
based on anticipated residual values for the airframes  engines  and parts  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of the dc fleets were subsequently retired from service 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
allowance for doubtful accounts losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred  which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date 
these estimates 
table of contents require consideration of historical loss experience  adjusted for current conditions  trends in customer payment frequency  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk 
deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was and million  respectively 
our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december   and was  and million  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of commodity  foreign exchange  and interest rate forward contracts  options  and swaps 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
as of december  and  however  we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
this transaction was reported in other investing activities in the statements of consolidated cash flows 
as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting  were designated as hedges  and maintained their effectiveness  the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges  which extended through the first quarter of foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of to months 
additionally  we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations 
the term of these swap agreements is commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 
interest rate risk we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
we also utilize 
table of contents forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations  as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans  which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
additionally  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk 
these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 
credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default 
sensitivity analysis the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
additionally  changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 
shock test result in millions change in fair value currency derivatives change in annual expense variable rate debt interest rate derivatives the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 

table of contents the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in critical accounting policies and estimates 
the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates  respectively  was not material as of december  or the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december  or
