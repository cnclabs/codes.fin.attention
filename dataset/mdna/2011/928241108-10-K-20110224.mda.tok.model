item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background viropharma incorporated and subsidiaries is a global biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that address serious diseases  with a focus on products used by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
we intend to grow through sales of our marketed products  through continued development of our product pipeline  expansion of sales into additional territories outside the united states and through potential acquisition or licensing of products or acquisition of companies 
we expect future growth to be driven by sales of cinryze  both domestically and internationally  and by our primary development programs  including c esterase inhibitor and a non toxigenic strain of c 
difficile vp 
we market and sell cinryze in the united states for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema hae 
cinryze is a c esterase inhibitor therapy for routine prophylaxis against hae  also known as c inhibitor c inh deficiency  a rare  severely debilitating  life threatening genetic disorder 
cinryze was obtained in october  when we completed our acquisition of lev pharmaceuticals  inc lev 
in january  we acquired expanded rights to commercialize cinryze and future c inh derived products in certain european countries and other territories throughout the world as well as rights to develop future c inh derived products for additional indications 
in march  our marketing authorization application maa for cinryze for acute treatment and prophylaxis against hae was accepted by the european medicines agency ema 
we intend to seek to commercialize cinryze in europe in in countries where we have distribution rights 
we are currently evaluating our commercialization plans in additional territories 
we also intend to conduct viropharma sponsored studies and support investigator initiated studies iis to identify further therapeutic uses and potentially expand the labeled indication for cinryze to include other c mediated diseases  such as antibody mediated rejection amr and delayed graft function dgf 
additionally  we are currently undertaking studies on the viability of subcutaneous administration of cinryze 
we also market and sell vancocin hcl capsules  the oral capsule formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride  in the us and its territories 
vancocin is a potent antibiotic approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile infection cdi  or c 
difficile  and enterocolitis caused by staphylococcus aureus  including methicillin resistant strains 
our product development portfolio is primarily focused on two programs  c esterase inhibitor 
human 
and vp we are working on developing further therapeutic uses  potential additional indications in other c mediated diseases  and alternative modes of administration for c esterase inhibitor 
we are also developing vp for the treatment and prevention of cdi 
on august  we announced that dosing had begun in the phase clinical trial for vp to determine the safety and tolerability of vp dosed orally as a single and as repeat escalating doses in healthy young and older adults 
we have successfully completed our phase clinical trial  filed an ind in december of and anticipate moving the compound into a phase clinical trial in the first half of in addition to these programs  we have several other assets that we may make additional investments in 
these investments will be limited and dependent on our assessment of the potential future commercial success of or benefits from the asset 
on may  we acquired auralis limited  a uk based specialty pharmaceutical company 
the acquisition of auralis provides us with the opportunity to accelerate our european commercial systems for potential future product launches and additional business development acquisitions 
we intend to continue to evaluate in licensing or other opportunities to acquire products in development  or those that are currently on the market 
we plan to seek products that treat serious or life threatening illnesses with a high unmet medical need  require limited commercial infrastructure to market  and which we believe will provide both top and bottom line growth over time 

table of contents executive summary since december   we experienced the following business activities cinryze shipped approximately  doses of cinryze to specialty pharmacy specialty distributors sp sd s  acquired expanded rights to commercialize cinryze and future c inh derived products in certain european countries and other territories throughout the world as well as rights to develop future c inh derived products for additional indications  ema accepted the filing of our maa for cinryze for acute treatment and prophylaxis against hae  initiated an open label  single dose phase study to evaluate doses of cinryze for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in children less than years of age with hae  presented cinryze data at annual meeting of the american college of allergy  asthma immunology acaai  and international scientific conference of the world allergy organization wao  conducted a multi dose phase study to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous formulation cinryze  and  submitted the cinryze industrial scale manufacturing prior approval supplement pas to fda and received a complete response letter regarding the cinryze industrial scale manufacturing expansion activities requesting additional information related to observations from the pre approval inspection and review of the technical processes  c

difficile vp at the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy icaac  and  vancocin scripts decreased in as compared to  financial results net sales of cinryze increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net sales of vancocin increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and  reported net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity generated net cash from operations of million  ended with working capital of million which includes cash and cash equivalents of million and investments of million 

table of contents during and going forward  we expect to face a number of challenges  which include the following the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  for reasons that include  but are not limited to  generic and non generic competition for vancocin and or changes in prescribing habits or disease incidence 
the fda convened a meeting of its advisory committee for pharmaceutical science and clinical pharmacology to discuss bioequivalence recommendations for oral vancomycin hydrochloride capsule drug products on august  the advisory committee was asked if the proposed guidelines are sufficient for establishing bioequivalence for generic vancomycin oral capsules 
the advisory committee voted unanimously in favor of the component of the proposed ogd recommendation that requires bioequivalence to be demonstrated through comparable dissolution in media of ph  and for potential vancomycin hcl capsule generic products that a contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same amounts as vancocin hcl capsules  b meet currently accepted standards for assay  potency  purity  and stability equivalent to those in place for vancocin hcl capsules  and c are manufactured according to cgmp 
we have opposed both the substance of the fda s bioequivalence method and the manner in which it was developed 
in the event the ogd s revised bioequivalence recommendation for vancocin remains in effect  the time period in which a generic competitor may enter the market would be reduced 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with the positions stated in our vancocin related submissions or that our efforts to oppose the ogd s march and december recommendation to determine bioequivalence to vancocin through in vitro dissolution testing will be successful 
we cannot predict the timeframe in which the fda will make a decision regarding either our citizen petition for vancocin or the approval of generic versions of vancocin 
if we are unable to change the recommendation set forth by the ogd in march as revised in december and voted upon by the advisory committee for pharmaceutical science and clinical pharmacology  the threat of generic competition will be high 
the fda approved cinryze for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema on october  cinryze became commercially available for routine prophylaxis against hae in december and the commercial success of cinryze will depend on several factors  including the number of patients with hae that may be treated with cinryze  acceptance by physicians and patients of cinryze as a safe and effective treatment  our ability to effectively market and distribute cinryze in the united states  cost effectiveness of hae treatment using cinryze  relative convenience and ease of administration of cinryze  potential advantages of cinryze over alternative treatments  the timing of the approval of competitive products including another c esterase inhibitor for the acute treatment of hae  the market acceptance of competing approved products such as berinert  patients ability to obtain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third party payors  variations in dosing arising from physician preferences and patient compliance  sufficient supply and reasonable pricing of raw materials necessary to manufacture cinryze  manufacturing or supply interruptions and capacity which could impair our ability to acquire an adequate supply of cinryze to meet demand for the product  and our ability to achieve expansion of manufacturing capabilities in the capacities and timeframes currently anticipated 
in addition  our ability to develop life cycle management plans for cinryze  including designing and commencing clinical studies for additional indications and pursuing regulatory approvals in additional indications or territories will impact our ability to generate future revenues from cinryze 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of the ppaca  as amended  is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the united states  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program 
several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  will affect us 
these include new requirements on private insurance companies that prohibit coverage denials because of a pre existing condition  prohibit the application of annual and lifetime benefits limits on health insurance policies  and prohibit 
table of contents coverage rescissions except for fraud and health based insurance rating 
in addition  the ppaca  as amended  funds an interim high risk pool that states can draw on  following the expiration of this high risk pool funding  it provides for the creation of state run exchanges that will allow people without employer provided coverage  or who cannot afford their employer s plan  to buy health insurance  and provides federal subsidies to those who cannot afford premiums 
collectively  these factors may increase the availability of reimbursement for patients seeking the products that viropharma commercializes 
however  the act  as amended  will likely increase certain of our costs as well 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from to was effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march  in  the ppaca also imposes a manufacturer s fee on the sale of branded pharmaceuticals excluding orphan drugs to specified government programs  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or doughnut hole 
our evaluation of ppaca  as amended  will continue to enable us to determine not only the immediate effects on our business  but also the trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation that may potentially impact on our business over time 
we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to further expand our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to further expand our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and greater resources to conduct business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
the outcome of our clinical development programs is subject to considerable uncertainties 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and ultimately commercializing any of our product candidates  that the fda or other regulatory authorities will not require additional or unanticipated studies or clinical trial outcomes before granting regulatory approval  or that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in the timeframes that we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments or cash flows from product sales will be sufficient to fund all of our ongoing development and operational costs  as well as the interest payable on our outstanding senior convertible notes  over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
moreover  the results of our business development efforts could require considerable investments 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  our expectations and assumption described in this annual report on form k 
the risks described in this report  our form k for the year ended december  are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
please also see our discussion of the risk factors in item a  which describe other important matters relating our business

these were partly offset from increased cost of sales million due to the increase in cinryze sales volume and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
revenues revenues consisted of the following in thousands for the years ended december  net product sales vancocin cinryze other total revenues revenue vancocin and cinryze product sales we sell vancocin only to wholesalers who then distribute the product to pharmacies  hospitals and long term care facilities  among others 
our sales of vancocin are influenced by wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  wholesaler buying decisions related to their desired inventory levels  and  ultimately  end user prescriptions  all of which could be at different levels from period to period 
we sell cinryze to specialty pharmacy specialty distributors sp sd s who then distribute to physicians  hospitals and patients  among others 
during  we continued work to expand our manufacturing capacity to insure the availability of cinryze to meet growing patient needs and believe our efforts will allow us to continue to meet this growing patient demand for the foreseeable future 
in the second quarter of  we introduced parallel chromatography produced cinryze into the trade which increased our supply so that we were able to start new patients on cinryze as needed without undue concern of any disruption of the availability of cinryze to those already receiving it 
in order to meet the anticipated longer term demand  we submitted to the fda a prior approval supplement pas in the second quarter of the pas involves a larger scale manufacturing 
table of contents project to significantly increase the cinryze production capabilities at sanquin 
in october  the fda issued a complete response letter regarding the cinryze industrial scale manufacturing expansion activities 
in the complete response letter the fda has requested additional information related to observations from the pre approval inspection and review of the technical processes 
we anticipate filing a response to the complete response letter during and in parallel will continue advancing additional initiatives intended to increase our capacity 
during the year ended december   net sales of vancocin increased compared to the increase is primarily due to price increases during  offset by lower sales volumes 
based upon data reported by ims health incorporated  prescriptions during the year ended december  decreased from the same period in by  which we believe is due to a decrease in the severity of the disease state  improved aseptic techniques and a suspected increase in compounding seen both in the hospital and long term care marketplace 
the units sold for the year ended december  decreased by compared to the same period in our net sales of cinryze during the year ended december  increased million compared to the same period in due to an increase in the number of patients receiving cinryze 
vancocin product sales are driven by demand fluctuations in trade inventories which could be at different levels from period to period 
cinryze product sales are influenced by prescriptions and the rate at which new patients are placed on cinryze 
we receive inventory data from our three largest wholesalers through our fee for service agreements and our two sp sd s through service agreements 
we do not independently verify this data 
based on this inventory data and our estimates  we believe that as of december   the wholesalers and sp sd s did not have excess channel inventory of either product 
cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights cost of sales increased for the year ended december  by million as compared to the same period in due to increased cinryze volume  partially offset by the impact of the step up on cost of sales related to the acquisition of lev million 
we utilized the entire inventory that was recorded at fair value as part of the lev purchase during additionally  included in the cost of sales for the year ended december  are expenses of million related to non refundable start up costs paid to a new plasma supplier and a million write off of inventory  produced as part of our effort to receive fda approval for a larger scale manufacturing line 
vancocin and cinryze cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs and excludes amortization of product rights 
since units are shipped based upon earliest expiration date  we would expect the cost of product sales of both vancocin and cinryze to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we may experience fluctuations in quarterly manufacturing yields 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts and clinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  stock compensation and other overhead costs 
due to advancements in our vp preclinical program  and our cinryze phase commitment and phase study in children  we expect future costs in these programs to exceed historical costs

in addition  the study failed to meet its key secondary endpoints 
additionally  we announced that our phase trial evaluating maribavir in liver transplant patients was discontinued and that all patients on study drug were moved to current standard of care 
during we continued enrollment in our solid organ liver study through february  conducted follow up visits necessary to complete both our phase studies following receipt of the results of our stem cell transplant study and continued to evaluate the results of our phase programs 
we continue to evaluate any potential alternative development strategies for maribavir 
our costs related to new initiatives represent expenses associated with our evaluation of a recombinant c inh technology and spending under our collaboration agreement with sanquin supporting their early stage research programs 
included in the other assets is a one time charge of approximately million associated with a re negotiation of a royalty arrangement on a product in late stage development 
anticipated fluctuations in future direct expenses are discussed under liquidity development programs

liquidity we expect that our sources of revenue will continue to arise from cinryze and vancocin product sales 
however  future sales of vancocin will vary based on the number of generic competitors that could enter the market if approved by the fda  the timing of entry into the market of those generic competitors and or the sales we may generate from an authorized generic version of vancocin 
in addition  there are no assurances that demand for cinryze will continue to grow or that demand for vancocin will continue at historical or current levels 
our ability to generate positive cash flow is also impacted by the timing of anticipated events in our cinryze and vp development programs  including the timing of our expansion as we intend to seek to commercialize cinryze in europe and certain other countries  the scope of the clinical trials required by regulatory authorities  results from clinical trials  the results of our product development efforts  and variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses 

table of contents the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and commercial efforts  business development activities  general and administrative expenses  debt service  and income tax payments 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because we have product candidates that are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
however  our future costs may exceed current costs as we anticipate we will continue to invest in our pipeline on our initiative to develop non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile  our phase program for cinryze  any additional studies to identify further therapeutic uses and expand the labeled indication for cinryze to potentially include other c mediated diseases as well as new modes of administration for cinryze

the most significant of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described under development programs as set forth below 
we are required to pay contingent consideration to lev shareholders upon achievement of a commercial milestone related cinryze sales  additional consideration to lilly based on the net sales of vancocin in and additional consideration to auralis shareholders upon achievement of a regulatory milestone 
additionally  our operating expenses will not decrease significantly if there is the introduction of a generic vancocin 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca 
the ppaca  as amended  will likely increase certain of our costs as well 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from to was effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march  in  the ppaca also imposes a manufacturer s fee on the sale of branded pharmaceuticals excluding orphan drugs to specified government programs  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or doughnut hole 
overall cash flows during the year ended december   we generated million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from our net income after adjustments for non cash items 
we used million of cash from investing activities mainly in the purchase of short term investments  as well as in the purchase of auralis and the additional purchase price consideration for vancocin 
our net cash provided by financing activities was million which relates to stock option exercises 
for the year ended december   we were provided with million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from our net income adjusted for our non cash items such as our goodwill impairment  depreciation and amortization expense and our deferred tax provision  partially offset by changes in working capital  specifically increases in accounts receivable and inventory due to the cinryze launch 
we used million of cash from investing activities primarily related to the additional purchase price consideration for vancocin and our net cash used in financing activities was million  mainly from the repurchase of a portion of our senior convertibles notes 
development programs for each of our development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility and other overhead costs 
additionally  for some of our development programs  we have cash inflows and outflows upon achieving certain milestones 

table of contents core development programs cinryze we acquired cinryze in october and through december  have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs related to cinryze since acquisition 
during  we continue to expect research and development costs related to cinryze to increase as we complete our phase commitment and initiate our phase study to evaluate cinryze for treatment of acute hae in children 
additionally  we will incur costs related to evaluating additional indications  formulations and territories as we develop our life cycle program related to cinryze such as our efforts on sub subcutaneous  amr and dgf 
we are solely responsible for the costs of cinryze development 
vp we acquired vp in february and through december  have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs 
during  we expect our research and development activities related to vp to increase as we continue our development program 
we are solely responsible for the costs of vp development 
vancocin we acquired vancocin in november and through december   we have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs related to vancocin activities since acquisition 
other assets in addition to the programs described above  we have several other assets that we may make additional investments in 
these investments will be dependent on our assessment of the potential future commercial success of or benefits from the asset 
these assets include maribavir for cmv  and other compounds 
we will continue to incur costs associated with our other development assets for direct research and development costs for medicinal products which will address unmet medical needs such as our current evaluation of a recombinant c inh technology which may be included in future clinical studies 
business development activities on may  we acquired a ownership interest in auralis limited  a uk based specialty pharmaceutical company for approximately million in upfront consideration for the acquisition of the company and its existing pharmaceutical licenses and products 
we have also agreed to pay an additional payment of million pounds sterling approximately million based on the december  exchange rate upon the first regulatory approval of a product in late stage development 
on october   we completed our acquisition under which viropharma acquired lev pharmaceuticals  inc lev 
lev is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
the terms of the merger agreement provided for the conversion of each share of lev common stock into upfront consideration of million  or per lev share  comprised of per share in cash and per share in viropharma common stock  and contingent consideration of up to per share which may be paid on achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones 
the target for the first cvr payment of per share or million will not be paid as a third party s human c inhibitor product was approved for the acute treatment of hae and granted orphan exclusivity 
the second cvr payment of per share million becomes payable if cinryze reaches at least million in cumulative net product sales by october and we anticipate achieving this milestone in we intend to continue to seek to acquire additional products or product candidates 
the costs associated with evaluating or acquiring any additional product or product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  and actual and potential generic and non generic competition for the product  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of evaluating or acquiring business development candidates  it is not feasible to predict what our actual evaluation or acquisition costs would be  if any  however  the costs could be substantial 

table of contents senior convertible notes on march   we issued million of senior convertible notes due march the senior convertible notes in a public offering 
net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes were million 
the senior convertible notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with any other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year commencing on september  as of january  we account for the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities as bifurcated instruments which are accounted for separately 
accordingly  the convertible debt securities will recognize interest expense at effective rates of as they are accreted to par value 
on march  we repurchased  in a privately negotiated transaction  million in principal amount of our senior convertible notes due march for total consideration of approximately million 
the repurchase represented of our then outstanding debt and was executed at a price equal to of par value 
additionally  in negotiated transactions  we sold approximately million call options for approximately million and repurchased approximately million warrants for approximately million which terminated the call options and warrants that were previously entered into by us in march we recognized a million gain in the first quarter of as a result of this debt extinguishment 
for tax purposes  the gain qualifies for deferral until in accordance with the provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act 
as of december   we have accrued million in interest payable to holders of the senior convertible notes 
debt issuance costs of million have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the senior convertible notes  with the balance to be amortized as of december  being million 
the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the senior convertible notes may only be converted i anytime after december   ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  iii during any calendar quarter and only during such quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
upon conversion  holders of the senior convertible notes will receive shares of common stock  subject to viropharma s option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes  and shares for any excess 
we can irrevocably elect this option at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes may be required to be repaid on the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  as defined in the senior convertible notes 
as of december   the fair value of the principal of the million convertible senior notes outstanding was approximately million  based on the level valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurements standard 
the carrying value of the debt at december  is million 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior convertible notes  we entered into privately negotiated transactions  comprised of purchased call options and warrants sold  to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the senior convertible notes 
the transactions  taken together  have the effect of increasing the initial conversion price to per share 
the net cost of the transactions was million 
the call options allowed viropharma to receive up to approximately million shares of its common stock at per share from the call option holders  equal to the number of shares of common stock that viropharma 
table of contents would issue to the holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
these call options will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity dates of the related senior convertible notes or the first day all of the related senior convertible notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
concurrently  we sold warrants to the warrant holders to receive shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants expire ratably over a day trading period beginning on june  and will be net share settled 
the purchased call options are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the senior convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock at the time of exercise is greater than  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the senior convertible notes  but less than the warrant exercise price 
the warrant exercise price is higher than the price per share of of our price on the pricing date 
if the market price per share of our common stock at the time of conversion of any senior convertible notes is above the strike price of the purchased call options  the purchased call options will entitle us to receive from the counterparties in the aggregate the same number of shares of our common stock as we would be required to issue to the holder of the converted senior convertible notes 
additionally  if the market price of our common stock at the time of exercise of the sold warrants exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants  we will owe the counterparties an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
if we have insufficient shares of common stock available for settlement of the warrants  we may issue shares of a newly created series of preferred stock in lieu of our obligation to deliver common stock 
any such preferred stock would be convertible into more shares of our common stock than the amount of common stock we would otherwise have been obligated to deliver under the warrants 
we are entitled to receive approximately million shares of our common stock at from the call option holders and if the market price of our common stock at the time of exercise of the sold warrants exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants  we will owe the counterparties an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the purchased call options and sold warrants are separate transactions entered into by us with the counterparties  are not part of the terms of the senior convertible notes  and will not affect the holders rights under the senior convertible notes 
holders of the senior convertible notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased call options or the sold warrants 
the purchased call options and sold warrants meet the definition of derivatives 
these instruments have been determined to be indexed to our own stock and have been recorded in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
as long as the instruments are classified in stockholders equity they are not subject to the mark to market requirements of us gaap 
contractual obligations future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years operating leases senior convertible notes collaboration agreements purchase obligations total this table does not include the contingent consideration of million pounds sterling approximately million based on the december  exchange rate which may be payable to the former shareholders of auralis  which we acquired on may   upon the first regulatory approval of a product in late stage development 
we account for this contingent consideration as a liability and recognize changes in its fair value in operating income 
we will continue to recognize such fair value changes in income until the ultimate disposition or settlement of this liability 

table of contents this table does not include any milestone payments under our agreement with gsk in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
the table does not include an additional payment which may be due to lilly in connection with the vancocin acquisition  as the amount and timing of future additional payments are not determinable 
under the terms of the agreement with lilly  lilly is entitled to an additional payment of of annual net sales of vancocin between and million during the table does not include additional payments to lev cvr holders 
as of december   only the second cvr as described below remains achievable 
the second cvr payment of per share million becomes payable if cinryze reaches at least million in cumulative net product sales by october and we anticipate achieving this milestone in this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
operating leases represent building and equipment leases 
these payments represent interest and principal related to our senior convertible notes due march pursuant to the terms of the row agreement  sanquin may conduct certain early stage research programs for which we will provide to sanquin  approximately million based on the december  exchange rate per year for a period of five years 
we have committed to purchase up to  liters of plasma in and up to  liters of plasma per year in through from our suppliers 
additionally  we are required to purchase a minimum number of units from our third party toll manufacturer 
excluded from these amounts is the manufacturing fee for cinryze produced under the eu and row agreement as the minimum purchase shall be determined by the joint steering committee in capital resources while we anticipate that cash flows from cinryze and vancocin  as well as our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  should allow us to fund our ongoing development and operating costs  as well as the interest payments on our senior convertible notes  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our investments consist of high quality fixed income securities and high quality debt securities or obligation of departments or agencies of the united states 
we generally invest in financial instruments with maturities of less than one year 
at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our investment portfolio was and the weighted average length to maturity was months 
should we need financing  we would seek to access the public or private equity or debt markets  enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into other alternative financing arrangements that may become available to us 
financing if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 

table of contents if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms and pricing for these financings may be much more favorable to the new lenders than the terms obtained from our prior lenders 
these financings also may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our operating results  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
from time to time  we may seek approval from our board of directors to evaluate additional opportunities to repurchase our common stock or convertible notes  including through open market purchases or individually negotiated transactions 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows product sales our net sales consist of revenue from sales of our products  vancocin  cinryze and diamorphine  less estimates for chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  returns and losses 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer  when estimated provisions for chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  returns and losses are reasonably determinable  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until estimates can be made for chargebacks  rebates and losses and all of the above conditions are met and when the product has achieved market acceptance  which is typically based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained during the period following launch 
at the end of each reporting period we analyze our estimated channel inventory and we would defer recognition of revenue on product that has been delivered if we believe that channel inventory at a period end is in excess of ordinary business needs 
further  if we believe channel inventory levels are increasing without a reasonably correlating increase in prescription demand  we proactively delay the processing of wholesaler orders until these levels are reduced 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates  sales discounts and product returns 
these accruals are primarily based upon the history of vancocin and for cinryze they are based on information on payee s obtained from our sp sd s and cinryzesolutions 
we also consider the volume and price of our products in the channel  trends in wholesaler inventory  conditions that might impact patient demand for our product such as incidence of disease and the threat of generics and other factors 
in addition to internal information  such as unit sales  we use information from external resources  which we do not verify  to estimate the vancocin channel inventory 
our external resources include 
table of contents prescription data reported by ims health incorporated and written and verbal information obtained from our three largest wholesaler customers with respect to their inventory levels 
based upon this information  we believe that inventory held at these warehouses are within normal levels 
chargebacks and rebates are the most subjective sales related accruals 
while we currently have no contracts with private third party payors  such as hmo s  we do have contractual arrangements with governmental agencies  including medicaid 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates related to these contracts in the period in which we record the sale as revenue 
these accruals are based upon historical experience of government agencies market share  governmental contractual prices  our current pricing and then current laws  regulations and interpretations 
we analyze the accrual at least quarterly and adjust the balance as needed 
these analyses have been adjusted to reflect the us healthcare reform acts and their affect on governmental contractual prices and rebates 
we believe that a change in our estimate of the actual rate of sales subject to governmental rebates would affect our operating income and accruals by approximately million in the period of adjustment  which we believe is immaterial 
annually  as part of our process  we performed an analysis on the share of vancocin and cinryze sales that ultimately go to medicaid recipients and result in a medicaid rebate 
as part of that analysis  we considered our actual medicaid historical rebates processed  total units sold and fluctuations in channel inventory 
we also consider our payee mix for cinryze based on information obtained at the time of prescription 
product return accruals are estimated based on vancocin s history of damage and product expiration returns and are recorded in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
cinryze has a no returns policy 
impairment of long lived assets we review our fixed and long lived intangible assets for possible impairment annually and whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the impairment test is a two step test 
under step one we assess the recoverability of an asset or asset group 
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss is measured in step two as the difference between the carrying value of the asset or asset group and its fair value 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include  for example  projections of future cash flows and the timing and number of generic competitive entries into the market  in determining the undiscounted cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of the asset and whether impairment exists 
these assumptions are subjective and could result in a material impact on operating results in the period of impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the fair value of our property and building held for sale and have determined that an additional impairment charge was required 
on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
on august  the fda s pharmaceutical science and clinical pharmacology advisory committee voted in favor of the ogd s draft guidelines on bioequivalence for vancocin 
if fda s proposed bioequivalence method for vancocin becomes effective  the time period in which a generic competitor could be approved would be reduced and multiple generics may enter the market  which would materially impact our operating results  cash flows and possibly intangible asset valuations 
this could also result in a reduction to the useful life of the vancocin related intangible assets 
management currently believes there are no indicators that would require a change in useful life as management believes that vancocin will continue to be utilized along with generics that may enter the market  and the number of generics and the timing of their market entry is unknown 

table of contents a reduction in the useful life  as well as the timing and number of generics  will impact our cash flow assumptions and estimate of fair value  perhaps to a level that could result in an impairment charge 
we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition actions and any announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators 
we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets at such time a triggering event occurs 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  to determine whether impairment may exist 
the goodwill impairment test consists of two steps 
the first step compares a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying amount to identify potential goodwill impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the second step of the impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
step two requires an assignment of the reporting unit s fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to determine the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized  if any 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets is a one step test  which compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
based on accounting standards  it is required that these assets be assessed annually for impairment unless a triggering event occurs between annual assessments which would then require an assessment in the period which a triggering event occurred 
during the first quarter of  our market capitalization dropped below the carrying value of our net assets due to the results of our phase trial evaluating maribavir used as prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant patients 
we concluded that the drop in our market cap was a triggering event which required us to perform an impairment test of our intangible assets and a step test for goodwill impairment 
as part of this process  we also assessed our intangible and fixed assets for impairment 
based on the analysis performed under step two  there was no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill and accordingly  we wrote off the entire goodwill balance and recognized a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of share based employee compensation the calculation of this expense includes judgment related to the period of time used in calculating the volatility of our common stock  the amount of forfeitures and an estimate of the exercising habits of our employees  which is also influenced by our insider trading policy 
changes in the volatility of our common stock or the habits of our employees could result in variability in the fair value of awards granted 
income taxes our income provision and related balance sheet accounts are determined based on enacted tax laws  published guidance and the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and related assets and liabilities including the expenses that qualify for income tax credits  such as the orphan drug credit 
deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if they are more likely than not to be realized through future income  reversal of temporary differences or tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is established if realization is not considered more likely than not 
if future results differ from those expected when the deferred tax asset is established  an additional valuation allowance may be required 
tax benefits are recognized on filed tax return positions that are more likely than not to be sustained 
challenges by the tax authorities could impact our income tax provision in future years 
acquisition accounting the application of the purchase accounting requires certain estimates and assumptions especially concerning the determination of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets and property  plant and equipment as well as the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition 
moreover  the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets  property  plant and equipment have to be determined 

table of contents the total purchase price of businesses acquired will be allocated to the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and the fair value of any contingent consideration 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be expensed in the period in which the change in fair value occurs 
additionally  acquired ipr d projects will initially be capitalized and considered indefinite lived assets subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events 
for those compounds that reach commercialization  the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives 
measurement of fair value and useful lives are based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows 
if actual cash flows vary from those used in calculating fair values  this may significantly affect our future results of operations 
in particular  the estimation of discounted cash flows of intangible assets of newly developed products is subject to assumptions closely related to the nature of the acquired products 
factors that may affect the assumptions regarding future cash flows long term sales forecasts  anticipation of selling price erosion after the end of orphan exclusivity due to follow on biologic competition in the market  behavior of competitors launch of competing products  marketing initiatives etc for significant acquisitions  the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent third party valuation specialists 
the valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu amends certain disclosure requirements of topic to provide for additional disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and and for activity in level the asu also clarifies certain other disclosure requirements including level of desegregation and disclosures around inputs and valuation techniques 
we adopted this asu on january  the new disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt this provision effective january  in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu  amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb asc topic this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance changes how to determine the fair value of undelivered products and services for separate revenue recognition 
allocation of consideration is now based on management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item where there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the disclosure requirements of asc topic  subsequent events so that sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements 
this revised guidance is effective immediately and we adopted this pronouncement on march  and have revised the disclosures as required 

table of contents in march  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition and as a result of this ratification the fasb issued asu in april  which states that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model for revenue recognition if the milestones are substantive and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the milestones will be achieved 
the task force agreed that whether a milestone is substantive is a judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with our acquisition of lev  we acquired purchase obligations related to the supply and manufacturing of cinryze 
we have committed to purchase a minimum number of liters of plasma per year through from our supplier 
additionally  we are required to purchase a minimum number of units from our third party toll manufacturer 
the total minimum purchase commitments for these continuing arrangements as of december  are approximately million 
in october  we terminated our agreement with plasma centers of america pca and our obligation to purchase plasma collected from centers own by pca
