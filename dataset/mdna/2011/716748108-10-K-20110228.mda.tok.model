item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the state of delaware with operations in oklahoma  texas  gulf coast basin  arkansas and wyoming 
we seek to grow our production  proved reserves  cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration  development and acquisition activities 
from the commencement of our operations in through  we were focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
we have successfully diversified into onshore  longer life basins in oklahoma  arkansas  wyoming and texas through a combination of selective acquisitions and drilling activity 
beginning in with our acquisition of the carthage field in texas through  we have invested approximately million into growing our longer life assets 
during the seven year period ended december   we have realized a drilling success rate on gross wells drilled 
comparing metrics with those in  the year we implemented our diversification strategy  we have grown production by and estimated proved reserves by 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves and of our production were derived from our longer life assets 
during late  in response to declining commodity prices and the global financial crisis  we shifted our focus from increasing reserves and production to building liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet 
because of our significant operational control  we were able to reduce our capital expenditures from million in to million in thus allowing us to utilize our cash flow from operations  combined with proceeds from an equity offering  to repay million of bank debt since the end of while we achieved our goal of strengthening the financial position of the company  because of the reduced capital investments during  our production declined by during 
table of contents during  we refocused on the key elements of our business strategy with the goal of growing reserves and production in a fiscally prudent manner 
our capital expenditures  which include capitalized interest and overhead  are expected to range between million and million 
in order to maintain our financial flexibility  we plan to fund our capital expenditures budget with cash flow from operations and million in additional proceeds to be received in under the woodford joint development agreement completed in may see liquidity and capital resources source of capital joint ventures 
we expect to be able to actively manage our capital budget in the event commodity prices or the health of the global financial markets do not match our expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
on december   the sec issued a revision to staff accounting bulletin sab which established guidelines related to modernizing accounting and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies 
the revised disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the revised rules also allow companies the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the existing requirement to disclose proved reserves 
the revised disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates 
a significant change to the rules involves the pricing at which reserves are measured 
the revised rules utilize a month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the month period prior to the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves rather than year end prices 
in addition  the month average will also be used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the revised rules were effective for reserve estimates beginning december  full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 

table of contents we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges in place  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future nymex prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third party s valuation model that utilizes market corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract 
our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary fluctuations were as follows production total production decreased during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the period 
gas production during the year ended december  decreased from the comparable period in the decrease in gas production was primarily the result of reduced capital spending during and normal production declines in the gulf coast area 
because approximately of our scheduled drilling program is allocated to our longer life assets  we expect gas production to approximate as we continue to experience normal declines in the gulf coast area  offset by increased long lived gas production 
oil production during the twelve month period ended december  increased from the period due to the restoration of production at our ship shoal field after repairs and a recompletion following hurricanes katrina and rita 
in addition  our oil production rates have increased from the drilling success of our turtle bayou prospect in and workovers at our ft 
trinidad field in e 
texas 
with our entry into the niobrara shale and eagle ford shale  which are both typically oil bearing formations  we expect to grow oil production during by approximately 
ngl production during the twelve month period ended december  decreased from the period due to the general decline in gulf coast and texas gas production 
prices including the effects of our hedges  average gas prices per mcf for the twelve month period ended december  were  as compared to for the period 
average oil prices per bbl for the twelve months ended december  were  as compared to for the period and average ngl prices per mcfe were and during and  respectively 
stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during the twelve months ended december  were lower than the prices received during the comparable period 

table of contents revenue including the effects of hedges  oil and gas sales during the twelve months ended december  decreased to  as compared to oil and gas sales of  during the period 
the decreased revenue during was primarily the result of lower production and a decrease in hedge settlements realized during the year ended december  expenses lease operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  during the period 
per unit lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to per mcfe during the period 
per unit lease operating expenses increased primarily due to the overall reduction in produced volumes as well as the general increase in the costs of services and materials 
lease operating expenses in are expected to generally approximate lease operating expenses in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  totaled  as compared to expenses of  during included in general and administrative expenses was share based compensation expense related to asc topic  as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation approximately  of share based compensation expense during the year ended december  was the result of the voluntary early cancellation of certain stock options and accelerated recognition of associated compensation expense 
in total  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to as a result of employee related costs including higher incentive compensation 
we capitalized  and  of general and administrative costs during the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses in are expected to approximate expenses 
the price of natural gas used in computing our estimated proved reserves during had a negative impact on our estimated proved reserves from certain of our longer life properties and reduced the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves 
as a result  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  no such write down was recorded during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe  during the comparable period 
the decline in our dd a per mcfe was primarily the result of the ceiling test write down of a substantial portion of our proved oil and gas properties during due to lower commodity prices  the impact of the woodford shale joint development agreement  as well as reserve additions during from our oklahoma and arkansas assets 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to  during the period 
we capitalized  of interest during the twelve month period ended december  and  during the period 
we have reduced the outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility from million at december  to zero at december  we also retired our senior notes due during august in connection with the issuance of our senior notes due  which we expect will result in a decrease in our cash used for interest payments during as a result of the early retirement of our senior notes  we incurred a loss during the third quarter of totaling  approximately  of the loss related to non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and discount associated with the senior notes 
in january  we recorded a gain relative to a  cash settlement received from a lawsuit filed by us in relating to disputed interests in certain oil and gas assets purchased in the gain was reduced by  of costs incurred by us directly related to the settlement 
in addition to the cash proceeds received  we were assigned additional working interests in certain producing properties 
we recorded an additional  gain representing the estimated fair market value of those interests on the effective date of the settlement 

table of contents other expense during included an accrual for potential liabilities associated with certain pending legal matters 
during  other expense included  related to payments made in connection with a drilling rig contract 
because we elected to idle this drilling rig  there were no corresponding assets to record in connection with the fixed payments required under this contract  regardless of actual rig usage 
as a result  the costs were recorded as a component of other expense 
this contract expired during july other expense during also included  related to drill pipe inventory which was impaired to reflect the lower of cost or market 
income tax expense benefit during the twelve months ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
we typically provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs recognized during and  we have incurred a cumulative three year loss 
as a result of this cumulative loss and the impact it has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we reduced the valuation allowance by  during the year ended december   the impact of which is included in our effective tax rate 
the valuation allowance was  as of december  our effective tax rate in will be impacted by adjustments to the valuation allowance 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in the net loss during was primarily attributable to the following production gas production during the twelve month period ended december  increased from the comparable period in the increase in gas production was primarily the result of a full year of production from discoveries at our pelican point and the bluffs prospects in south louisiana and increased production from our oklahoma and arkansas wells 
oil production during the year ended december  decreased from the comparable period primarily due to normal production declines at our ship shoal and turtle bayou fields which produce approximately half of our total oil production 
ngl production during the twelve month period ended december  decreased from the period due to the general decline in texas gas production 
while production increased overall by in  we experienced declines in each quarter throughout as a result of our reduced capital expenditures 
prices including the effects of our hedges  average oil prices per barrel during were  as compared to during average gas prices per mcf were during  as compared to during average ngl prices per mcfe were during  as compared to during stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during revenue including the  received from our hedges  oil and gas sales during the year ended december  totaled  a decrease from oil and gas sales of  during the decreased revenue during was primarily the result of lower average pricing and decreased oil production 
expenses lease operating expenses for year ended december  decreased to  from  during per unit lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe during as compared to per mcfe during the decreases in lease operating expenses were primarily due to the decline in costs of services and materials in the markets in which we operated as the demand for such materials and services weakened as a result of the decline in commodity prices and the overall condition of the oil and gas industry and the global economy 
production taxes totaled  and  during and  respectively 
production taxes decreased in for the following reasons 
during the third quarter of  we filed for a production tax refund in the amount of  at our pelican point prospect as the well qualified for a deep well severance tax exemption for a period of months from the initial production date of may in addition  we received a production tax refund of  during the second quarter of related to certain of our horizontal wells in oklahoma that qualify for a month production tax exemption 
finally  the impact of lower commodity prices realized for the production from our oklahoma  arkansas and texas properties contributed to the decline in production taxes during the period 
partially offsetting these decreases was a increase in the louisiana gas severance tax rate effective july  
table of contents general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during included in general and administrative expenses was share based compensation expense related to asc topic as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation we capitalized  of general and administrative costs during the twelve month period ended december  and  during the comparable period 
the decline in general and administrative expenses during was  in part  due to lower non cash share based compensation 
in addition  during may  we incurred compensation expense of approximately million  or approximately million net of capitalization  related to our election to pay employee taxes on the vesting of certain restricted stock grants 
no similar expense was incurred during the price of natural gas used in computing our estimated proved reserves during had a negative impact on our estimated proved reserves from certain of our longer life properties and reduced the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves 
as a result  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  see note  ceiling test for further discussion of the ceiling test write downs 
by comparison  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties during totaling  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe during the decline in our dd a per mcfe was the result of the ceiling test write downs of a substantial portion of our proved oil and gas properties during and the fourth quarter of as a result of lower commodity prices 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during as compared to  during we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during the year ended was due to the increase in our bank debt outstanding during the first nine months of as compared to the first nine months of during the second half of  we repaid a total of million of bank borrowings 
other expense during includes  related to payments made in connection with a drilling rig contract 
as a result of the significant decline in natural gas prices  we elected to idle this drilling rig 
because there were no corresponding assets to record in connection with the fixed payments required under the contract  regardless of actual rig usage  the costs were recorded as a component of other expense 
this contract expired during july no similar expense was incurred during other expense during also included  related to drill pipe inventory which was impaired to reflect the lower of cost or market 
income tax benefit during totaled  as compared to  during we provided for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs  we had incurred a cumulative three year loss 
as a result of this cumulative loss and the impact it had on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we established a valuation allowance of  as of december  the impact of this valuation allowance was included in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  second lien term credit facilities  issuances of equity and debt securities  joint ventures and sales of assets 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million compared to a surplus of million at december  the increase was primarily due to the cash received from the woodford shale joint development agreement and the settlement of the lawsuit discussed above 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to many factors beyond our control such as weather  the overall condition of the global financial markets and economies  relatively minor changes in the outlook of supply and demand  and the actions of opec 
oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
lower prices and reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  including under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
see source of capital debt below 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as oil and natural gas prices 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations increased from  in to  during the increase in operating cash flow during was primarily attributable to the timing of payments made in to reduce our accounts payable to vendors and the cash received during the first quarter of in connection with a legal settlement 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase to our joint interest billing receivables  which is a result of the increase in drilling activity 
source of capital debt on august   we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the notes in a public offering 
the net proceeds of the offering  together with cash on hand  were used to fund our tender offer and consent solicitation and redemption of our senior notes due in total  we incurred a loss of million relating to the early retirement of the senior notes 
approximately million of the loss related to non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and discount associated with the senior notes 
at december   the estimated fair value of the notes was million  based upon a market quote provided by an independent broker 
the notes have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september at december   million had been accrued in connection with the march  interest payment and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the notes 
we have a credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  calyon new york branch  bank of america  na  wells fargo bank  na  and whitney national bank 
the credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
in connection with the retirement of the senior notes in august  the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to october  as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement and availability of million 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas properties as of january and july of each year 
the current borrowing base is million effective september  the next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to occur by march  we or the lenders may request two additional borrowing base redeterminations each year 
each time the borrowing base is to be re determined  the administrative agent under the credit agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion  which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is to be increased  or by lenders holding two thirds of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced 

table of contents the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including a lien on all equipment and at least of the aggregate total value of our oil and gas properties 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate abr plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage or the adjusted libo rate eurodollar plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the alternate base rate is equal to the highest of i the jpmorgan chase prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii the adjusted libo rate plus 
for the purposes of the definition of alternative base rate only  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which dollar deposits of  with a one month maturity are offered by the principal london office of jpmorgan chase bank  na in immediately available funds in the london interbank market 
for all other purposes  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market for one  two  three or six months as selected by us are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities 
outstanding letters of credit are charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to eurodollar loans  a fronting fee and customary administrative fees 
in addition  we pay commitment fees of 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit agreement  including a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt  liens  dividends  distributions and redemptions  investments  loans and advances  nature of business  international operations and foreign subsidiaries  leases  sale or discount of receivables  mergers or consolidations  sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  negative pledge agreements  gas imbalances and swap agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement 
source of capital issuance of securities on june   we received net proceeds of approximately million through the public offering of million shares of our common stock  which included the issuance of million shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
during october  a new shelf registration statement was declared effective  which allows us to publicly offer and sell up to million of any combination of debt securities  shares of common and preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital joint ventures in may  we entered into a joint development agreement with wsgp  a subsidiary of nextera energy resources  llc  whereby wsgp acquired approximately bcfe of our woodford proved undeveloped reserves as well as the right to earn of our undeveloped woodford acreage position through a two phase drilling program 
we received approximately million in cash at closing  net of million in transaction fees  and will receive an additional million on november  if certain production performance metrics are achieved  we will receive an additional million during the drilling program 
additionally  wsgp will fund a share of our future drilling costs under a long term drilling program 
the additional capital provided by this agreement allows us to accelerate the pace of our development of the woodford shale and pursue opportunities in other basins 
we have also entered into an eagle ford shale joint acquisition interim agreement and a marcellus shale joint acquisition interim agreement with nextera energy gas producing  llc negp  a subsidiary of nextera energy resources  llc  whereby negp will have the option to participate as a partner in the leasing and development of these shale plays 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continuously evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future 

table of contents use of capital exploration and development our capital budget  which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
because we operate the majority of our activities  we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments 
as a result  we plan to fund our capital budget with cash flow from operations and the million in additional proceeds to be received in from the woodford joint development agreement 
however  if commodity prices decline or if actual production or costs vary significantly from our expectations  our exploration and development activities could be reduced or could be financed through a combination of cash on hand or borrowings under the bank credit facility 
use of capital acquisitions we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our existing asset base or establish positions in new core areas 
during  we acquired acreage positions in the niobrara shale and the eagle ford shale with development activities budgeted for both areas during we plan to actively pursue opportunities to expand these positions during  as well as increase the scope of certain of our other assets and enter new areas 
we expect to finance these activities  if consummated  through cash on hand or available borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we may also utilize sales of equity or debt securities  sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners  if necessary 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands after total senior notes operating leases capital projects purchase commitments total includes principal and estimated interest 
consists primarily of leases for office space and office equipment 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our oil and gas properties 
consists of certain drilling rig contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we expect to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received approximately million from the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with net hedge settlements 

table of contents we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
our credit agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under the credit agreement or  if not a lender under the credit agreement  rated a a or higher by s p or moody s 
currently  the counterparties to our existing hedge contracts are jpmorgan chase bank and bank of america  which are lenders under the credit agreement 
to the extent we enter into additional hedge contracts  we would expect that certain of the lenders under the credit agreement would serve as counterparties 
as of december   we had entered into the following oil and gas hedge contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas costless collar  mmbtu crude oil costless collar bbl at december   we recognized a liability of approximately million related to the estimated fair value of these derivative instruments 
based on estimated future commodity prices as of december   we would realize a million loss  net of taxes  as a decrease to oil and gas sales during the next months 
these losses are expected to be reclassified based on the schedule of oil and gas volumes stipulated in the derivative contracts 
during january   we entered into the following additional gas hedge contract accounted for as a cash flow hedge instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas february december costless collar  mmbtu
